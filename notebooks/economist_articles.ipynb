Once in northern Iraq, according to \\nMr Allawi, some 10,000 barrels per day \\n(bpd) flow through a pipeline to the Turk- \\nish port of Ceyhan, where it is sold as Iraqi \\noil. But blind eyes are turned. None of the \\nKurdish middlemen in the trade has been \\nblacklisted. One of the largest, Abu Dilo, \\noperates from a currency-exchange in \\nQamishli, a mainly Kurdish-run city near \\nthe Turkish border, with heavies guarding \\nthe entrance. America considers the oil \\ntrade a fitting reward for the Kurds, who \\nlost thousands of fighters in the war \\nagainst IS.  Setting suns again \\n\\nAt the urging of their American backers, \\nand to win over local Arabs and placate \\ntheir neighbours, the Kurdish forces in \\nnorthern Syria have played down Kurdish \\nnationalism and their links to the PKK \\n(which America and the EU, as well as Tur- \\nkey, consider a terrorist organisation). \\nHaving once called the enclave Rojava, \\nKurdish for “land of the setting sun”, the \\nKurds now call it the Autonomous Admin- \\nistration of North and East Syria (NES), em- \\nphasising, in the light of the KRG’s experi- \\nence, a desire for autonomy rather than \\noutright independence. \\n\\nThey have also moved their administra- \\ntive seat away from the front lines with \\nTurkey to Raqga, an Arab city which served \\nas the capital of the 1s caliphate, and was \\nreduced to rubble during its defeat. While \\nthe cities still under the control of Syria’s \\npresident, Bashar al-Assad, lie in ruins, oil \\nmoney and Western aid are bringing Raqqa \\nback to life. As in much of the rest of the \\nenclave, roadsides are piled with marble \\nSlabs, concrete blocks and rebar. Local offi- \\ncials say that much of Raqqa’s housing \\nstock has been restored, and its university, \\nclosed by Is, is set to reopen in August. Lel- \\nla Mustafa, the Kurdish woman running \\nthe city’s council, says “We want it to be \\nSyria's capital.” \\n\\nThat illustrates the NES’s professed \\ncommitment to a united but federal Syria. \\nThe forces governing the NES want Mr As- \\nsad to recognise their region’s autonomy \\nand grant it a budget subsidy and a share of \\nthe country’s raw materials. But the gov- \\nernment in Damascus, faced with dire \\nbread and petrol shortages, fumes at NES’s \\nbogarting of the country’s resources: “Pi- \\nrates!” snaps Syria’s oil minister, Bassam \\nTomeh.

Under Bill Clinton and \\nBarack Obama the Democrats found \\nfriends in Silicon Valley and on Wall \\nStreet, but they never overcame the \\nRepublican formula of cutting taxes, \\nopposing regulation and reaping cor- \\nporate campaign support. \\n\\nDonald Trump’s populism and the \\ngrowing power of the consumer are \\ntearing at the old order. Companies are \\ncoming under tremendous new pressure \\nfrom the left. Some fear customer boy- \\ncotts if they fail to take stands on divisive \\nsocial questions. Others, less vulnerable \\nto consumers, fear revolts by their pro- \\ngressive MBAS and software engineers. \\n\\nThe latest catalyst of conflict is a law \\npassed in Georgia which facilitates vot- \\ning in some respects but also makes \\nabsentee voting harder and gives the \\nlegislature more control over the pro- \\ncess. Democrats accused Republicans of \\ntrying to suppress voters, in particular \\nblack voters. Mr Biden called the law “Jim \\nCrow in the 21st century”.

Ed Bastian, \\nthe CEO of Delta Air Lines, which like \\nCoca-Cola has its headquarters in Atlan- \\nta, called the law “unacceptable”. And \\nMajor League Baseball (MLB) announced \\nit would move its annual all-star game \\nout of Atlanta, though Democratic lead- \\ners in Georgia lamented the lost revenue. \\n\\nRepublicans are now threatening \\nreprisals of their own. The Georgia \\nHouse of Representatives has already \\nvoted to strip Delta of a jet-fuel tax bene- \\nfit worth $35m. That bill awaits action by \\nthe state Senate. Mr Trump called for \\nRepublicans to “boycott all of the woke \\ncompanies’, and put out a list that in- \\ncluded not only MLB, Coca-Cola and \\nDelta but others that criticised the law \\nsuch as JPMorgan Chase and ViacomcBs. \\n\\nThe conflict is exposing double stan- \\ndards on all sides.

       "  '(> ETHE MAN’, Says an advert for the Se- \\n\\nlective Service System. The entreaty \\nis not merely a suggestion. For decades, \\nregistering for the Selective Service—the \\nfederal agency that keeps a roster of Amer- \\nica’s 18- to-25-year-old men, in case a mili- \\ntary draft returns—has been a legal duty \\nmales must fulfil within 30 days of their \\n18th birthday. \\n\\nWhether citizen or immigrant, dual na- \\ntional or national guardsman, all men \\nmust comply or face investigation by the \\nDepartment of Justice. Potential conse- \\nquences are not light: denial of student \\nloans, disqualification from citizenship, \\nfines reaching $250,000 and up to five \\nyears in prison. \\n\\nA new petition to the Supreme Court \\nchallenges a broad carve-out to this rule. \\nBy requiring men (and transgender wom-  en) to register for the Selective Service, but \\nexempting women (and transgender men), \\nthe plaintiffs say, the federal government \\nis involved in invidious gender discrimi- \\nnation barred by the constitution. \\n\\nNational Coalition For Men v Selective \\nService System revisits a 1981 ruling that up- \\nheld the Selective Service’s sorting by sex. \\nThat judgment, Rostker v Goldberg, came \\nwhen women could not serve in combat \\nroles. “Rostker’s fundamental premise is no \\nlonger true,’ the plaintiffs say. “In 2013, the \\nDepartment of Defence lifted the ban on \\nwomen in combat” and two years later “an- \\nnounced that all military roles, units and \\nschools would officially be open to women \\nwith ‘no exceptions’.” \\n\\nNow that women fly fighter jets and \\nServe aS army rangers, the reasoning goes, \\nthere is no justification for giving them a \\npass on registering for the Selective Ser- \\nvice. So held Gray Miller, a district-court \\njudge in Texas, in 2019. The Fifth Circuit \\nCourt of Appeals shared that sentiment but \\nreversed Judge Miller’s ruling. Rostker is \\nstill binding law, the court noted, and new \\ncircumstances do not give alower court “li- \\ncence to disregard or overrule” a Supreme \\nCourt precedent. \\n\\nWill the justices agree to reconsider \\ntheir 40-year-old ruling—released days be- \\nfore Sandra Day O’Connor would be nomi- \\nnated as the first woman to join their \\nranks—that “men and women are simply \\nnot similarly situated” in the military con- \\ntext? The plaintiffs cite a 1973 case argued \\nby a young Ruth Bader Ginsburg (two de- \\ncades before she became a Supreme Court \\njustice) as encouragement: “Although pur- \\nportedly protective of women’, stereotypes \\nof women as belonging at home put them \\n“not ona pedestal, but ina cage’. \\n\\nThe American Civil Liberties Union is \\nbringing the case on behalf of a men’s- \\nrights group and two male plaintiffs.

       "  'HE PANDEMIC has played havoc with \\nTccttege admissions. With many testing \\nsites closed, over 1,400 colleges and uni- \\nversities (about a third of American de- \\ngree-granting institutions) no longer re- \\nquired admissions exams for first-year \\nstudents applying for autumn 2021. Many \\nmade the submission of test scores option- \\nal; 69 did not consider test scores at all. \\nMore than 1,300 colleges have already an- \\nnounced “test-optional” policies for 2022. \\n\\nThe coronavirus has hastened a trend \\nalready under way. Starting with a handful \\nof institutions in 2005, and growing to ov- \\ner1,000 (including half of the top 100 liber- \\nal-arts colleges) in 2019, many had gone \\ntest-optional before the pandemic. In May \\n2020 the governing body of the University \\nof California, a public university with over  >» campuses, voted to phase out the two main \\nadmissions tests, SAT and ACT, over five \\nyears. But a lawsuit sped up the timeline. A \\npreliminary injunction prevented the uni- \\nversity from using the SAT or ACT in admis- \\nsions or scholarship decisions this year. \\n\\nOpponents argue that these tests are bi- \\nased. SAT and ACT scores are highly corre- \\nlated with income, race and gender. De- \\nSpite earning higher maths grades in \\nschool, women perform worse than men \\non the maths section of the SAT by 18 points \\n(out of 800) on average. A student with an \\nannual family income below $20,000 can \\nexpect to score 137 points lower on average \\n(also out of 800) on the reading section of \\nthe saT than a student with a family in- \\ncome above $200,000. Overall, black and \\nHispanic students perform worse than \\nwhite students, and white students per- \\nform worse than Asian students. Similar \\nconcerns apply to the AcT. \\n\\nJanet Godwin, CEO of ACT, which tests \\nabout half of all American high-school \\ngraduates, says the test outcomes are a \\nsymptom of systemic inequality, not a \\ncause. She admits that the results are cor- \\nrelated with income, but she attributes this \\nto the fact that a child living in a high-in- \\ncome zip code will have access to better re- \\nsources. ACT has partnered with educa- \\ntional groups to provide access to test-pre- \\nparatory resources to help close this gap. \\n\\nColleges have experienced a surge in \\ndemand since test-optional policies went \\ninto effect. First-year applications at Har- \\nvard jumped 42% (and the acceptance rate \\nfell to 3.4%, from 4.9% last year); those at \\nNew York University rose by 17%. “A lot of \\nstudents who felt that the SAT or ACT was a \\nbarrier to getting into those institutions \\nare now taking their chances by applying,” \\nsays Angel Pérez, CEO of the National Asso- \\nciation for College Admission Counselling. \\n\\nBut with test scores downplayed or re- \\nmoved, admissions counsellors must fo- \\ncus on other aspects of an application. \\nSome of those may also favour the privi- \\nleged.

Astoundingly for an \\nincumbent who has overseen one of the \\nworst pandemic responses in the world, he \\nremains popular, with nearly two-thirds \\ngiving him the thumbs up (see chart). Yet \\nwhen it comes to his policies, Mexicans are \\nfar less sure of AMLO, as he is known. \\n\\nOne of his weaknesses is the economy, \\nwhich shrank by 8.5% in 2020, the worst \\nslump since the 1930s. Some 47% of voters \\nthink he is managing it badly, second only \\nto the share who disapprove of his hand- \\nling of organised crime (52% think he is \\ndoing poorly at curbing gangs). That \\nshould worry him. On June 6th hundreds \\nof seats are up for grabs in legislative, local \\nand gubernatorial elections. Morena, the \\nparty he founded, which is now the head of \\na coalition government, leads in the polls. \\nBut the election will still be seen as an im- \\nportant test for his brand of populism. \\n\\nWhen he arrived in office, AMLO made \\nbig promises. He vowed to reduce poverty \\nand to double Mexico’s lacklustre annual \\ngrowth rate, which has been stuck at an an- \\nnual average of just 2% for almost four de- \\ncades. But his policies have not, by and \\nlarge, lived up to the hype. In 2019, before \\ncovid-19 hit, the economy shrank by 0.1%. \\nThat was despite falling interest rates, a ro- \\nbust economy in the United States, which \\nabsorbs three-quarters of Mexico’s ex- \\nports, and the signing of the USMCA trade \\ndeal by the United States, Canada and Mex- \\nico to replace NAFTA. \\n\\n“What growth there has been in Mexico \\nin recent years has come from a growing \\npopulation and investment. [And] AMLO \\ndamaged the latter,” says Santiago Levy, a \\nformer deputy finance minister under the \\nInstitutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), \\nwhich ran the show for most of the 2oth \\ncentury and is now part of the opposition. \\nBetween 2018 and 2019 foreign direct in- \\nvestment fell by 5%, thanks to the govern- \\nment’s habit of reneging on contracts. Ear- \\nly in his term AMLO pulled the plug ona \\nnew international airport in Mexico City \\nplanned by his predecessor, which was \\nhalf-built; much of the planned budget of \\n$13bn had already been spent. \\n\\nThe most disruptive example of AMLO’s \\nerratic policymaking is in the energy sec- \\ntor, where he is determined to boost state  providers.

The blossoms have long \\nprovoked reflections on beauty, tran- \\nSience and the unceasing rhythms of the \\nnatural world. This year, their annual \\nappearance has many thinking about \\nhow those rhythms are changing. The \\ncherry trees in Tokyo began flowering on \\nMarch 14th, tying the record for the \\nearliest start since the Japan Meteoro- \\nlogical Agency began monitoring 1n 1953. \\nIn Kyoto the trees reached full bloom on \\nMarch 26th, the earliest date in 1,200 \\nyears of records. Scientists believe cli- \\nmate change is to blame. \\n\\nSoon sakura may come not just early, \\nbut in less profusion. The cherry tree \\ncommon in most of Japan, the Some!i \\nYoshino breed, requires a protracted cold \\nspell in autumn and winter in order to \\nproduce its resplendent buds in spring. \\nTemperatures must remain below 8°C for \\naround 40 days—something that is no \\nlonger a certainty in parts of southern \\nJapan. Happily, scientists at Riken, a \\nresearch institute, have created a less \\npicky variety. Abe Tomoko and her col- \\nleagues scrambled cherry stones’ DNA by \\nirradiating them in a particle accelerator. \\nThe result is the Nishina Otome variety,  which still flowers after a mild winter. \\n\\nIt is not just cherry trees that climate \\nchange is confusing, however, but also \\nthe poets who write paeans to them. \\nSeasons have long occupied a prominent \\nplace in Japanese literature: Kokinwa- \\nkashu, a poetry anthology published in \\nthe1oth century, opens with six chapters \\nof seasonal poems. Basho, who popular- \\nised haikus in the 17th century, tended to \\ninclude in his poems kigo, or seasonal \\nwords, to anchor them temporally and \\nthus evoke a certain emotional state. \\n\\nOver the centuries, poets compiled \\nalmanacs of kigo, categorising most \\nnatural and even some human phenome- \\nna by season, or even by particular \\nmonths. But as the climate warms and \\nweather becomes more extreme, kigo are \\nslipping from their seasonal moorings. \\nThis “season creep” makes it harder for \\ncontemporary readers to understand \\ntraditional haiku, says David McMurray, \\nwho teaches the form at the Internation- \\nal University of Kagoshima.

So after \\nSlovenia seceded from Yugoslavia 1n 1991, it \\ngave Radio-Television of Slovenia (RTV- \\nSLO) a mandate to report independently, \\nunlike the state propaganda that passed for \\nnews under communism. Indeed, RTV-SLO \\nhas proved too independent for Slovenia's \\ncurrent prime minister, Janez Jansa. For \\nmore than a year he has been browbeating \\nthe network's journalists on social media, \\ncalling their reports “fake news”. Wags \\nhave consequently dubbed Mr Jansa “Mar- \\nShal Twito”, a nod to Josip Tito, Yugosla- \\nvias longtime dictator. His government \\nnow wants to pass a new media law that \\nwill make RTV-SLO easier to control. \\n\\nThe Netherlands’ national public news \\nbroadcaster, the NOS, also has its roots ina \\nreaction against authoritarian propag- \\nanda, that of the Nazi occupiers during the \\nsecond world war. The Nos has an inde- \\npendent board and a guaranteed multi- \\nyear budget. But lately Dutch public broad- \\ncasters have faced intimidation, too. Re- \\nporters have been physically attacked at  protests and while reporting on covid-19 \\nmeasures. In October the NOs removed its \\nlogo from its satellite vans after they were \\nrepeatedly harassed in traffic. \\n\\nThe problems in Slovenia and the Neth- \\nerlands are typical of those that are \\nincreasingly facing public broadcasters all \\nover Europe. In some countries, such as \\nHungary and Poland, illiberal govern- \\nments are turning them into mouthpieces \\nfor the ruling party. In others, such as Ger- \\nmany and Sweden, populist movements \\naccuse them of bias in favour of the estab- \\nlishment and the left.

But Meerkat, \\nan app which pioneered it, shut down the \\nfollowing year. On April ist Periscope, its \\nmore successful rival, did too (no joke). \\nWill Clubhouse, a buzzy app that hosts live \\naudio gabfests, suffer the same fate? \\n\\nLaunched at the start of the pandemic \\nlast March, Clubhouse quickly became Sil- \\nicon Valley’s most-talked-about app and a \\nfavourite stage for rock-star entrepre- \\nneurs. Elon Musk offered his views on co- \\nlonising Mars and rewiring the brain to \\nthousands of listeners. Marc Andreessen \\nand Ben Horowitz, co-founders of a big \\nventure-capital firm, regularly hold forth. \\nMore mortal Valleyites discuss everything \\nfrom the future of San Francisco to the tes- \\nty relations between tech and the media. \\nThis year the Clubhouse craze went global, \\noffering a venue for frank conversations in \\nplaces from Saudi Arabia to South Korea. \\n\\nAmid the buzz, problems are emerging. \\nYou still need an invitation from an exist- \\ning user, but these are easy to come by. As \\nnewcomers flood the app, the quality of de- \\nbate has dropped. Without systematic \\nmoderation, chats entitled “How to disci- \\npline and train your women” or worse are \\npopping up. Despite lower barriers to en- \\ntry, the app’s downloads were down to \\n2.7m in March, from 9.6m in February, ac- \\ncording to Sensor Tower, a data provider. \\n\\nOn the business side, Clubhouse has yet \\nto work out how to make money (ideas in- \\nclude tipping and membership fees for vir- \\ntual clubs).

Face- \\nbook is expected to launch a clone soon. \\nOn March 30th Spotify acquired Locker \\nRoom, a sports-themed group-chat app. \\nEven LinkedIn and Slack, two business- \\noriented services, are following suit. \\n\\nIt is too early to count Clubhouse out.

       "  \"aa HE IMPOSSIBLE can many times be- \\nT come possible,” reflects Albert Bour- \\nla, boss of Pfizer. He is talking about the \\ngiant American drugmaker’s speedy devel- \\nopment (with BioNTech of Germany) of a \\nvaccine against covid-19. The sentiment al- \\nSO applies to the turnaround in the for- \\ntunes of the pharmaceutical industry. \\n\\nBefore the pandemic Big Pharma was in \\nbig trouble. It was widely criticised for in- \\nvesting more in marketing than in re- \\nsearch, for pursuing “me too” drugs over \\nnovel therapies, and for alleged price- \\ngouging. When Gallup, a pollster, asked \\nAmericans in 2019 to rank two dozen big \\nindustries by favourability, the drugs busi- \\nness came in last. That year its bosses were \\nsubjected to a Big Tobacco-style bipartisan \\nhazing in Congress, which threatened \\nprice controls. Concerns over diminishing \\nresearch gains, and returns, weighed on \\ndrugmakers’ share prices (see chart). \\n\\nAt first, the pandemic looked like an- \\nother blow. Supply chains for essentials \\nsuch as precursor chemicals were disrupt- \\ned. As hospitals focused on covid-19, lucra- \\ntive elective treatments were postponed. \\nSo were clinical trials of new medicines, on \\nwhich future profits depend. Then some- \\nthing happened. As economies gradually \\nreopened last year, drug sales began to re- \\ncover. Several firms have, like Pfizer, come \\nup with effective vaccines against covid-19. \\nPfizer reckons the sales of its jab will sur- \\npass $15bn in 2021. The firm reckons it \\ncould add more than $4bn to its adjusted \\nprofits before tax. Investors are becoming \\nmore bullish on the sector. \\n\\nThe reasons for optimism extend be- \\nyond the covid-i9 jab. Another pharma \\nboss recently declared to a private audi- \\nence that the pandemic was “a significant \\ninflection point for the industry”. Unlikely \\nas it may have seemed a year ago, a nim- \\nbler, more innovative business is emerging \\nfrom adversity. \\n\\nThe breathless race against covid-19 led \\npharma to “break all of the rules”, says Tim \\nvan Biesen of Bain, a consultancy. This \\nprompted CEOs to ask why they weren't \\nmore agile in their day-to-day operations. \\nJohn Reed, head of research and develop- \\nment (R&D) at Sanofi, a French giant, says \\nthe pandemic has pushed decision-mak- \\ning lower down the corporate ladder, help- \\ning his firm move with a greater sense of \\nurgency. “We got trial concepts together in \\nthree or four days that took three or four  months in the past,” he marvels. \\n\\nSam Glick of Oliver Wyman, a consul- \\ntancy, notes that new patient enrolment \\nfor clinical trials, which plunged by nearly \\n80% amid the pandemic, has rebounded as \\nfirms have embraced digital tools such as \\nremote monitoring, electronic patient- \\nScreening and tele-consultations.

When Coinbase, a mar- \\nketplace for such digital monies, starts \\ntrading on April 14th, it will be on a boring, \\nconventional stock exchange, and not—as \\nmight befit one of the world’s biggest cryp- \\nto firms—on a buzzy blockchain, as the \\ntechnology that powers the likes of bitcoin \\nis called. \\n\\nYet for investors in Coinbase the flota- \\ntion seems set to be a hit. In contrast with \\nregular initial public offerings (IPOs), no \\nnew shares will be sold and existing inves- \\ntors do not have to wait six months before \\nthey can flip their stock, meaning they can \\nbenefit from any early excitement and a \\nhigh share price. And Coinbase’s first- \\nquarter results, released on April 6th, seem \\ncertain to generate excitement. It provi- \\nsionally estimates a profit of $730m-800m \\non revenue of about $1.8bn, up from $179m \\nand $585m, respectively, in the last three \\nmonths of 2020. Its initial valuation could \\ntop $100bn, perhaps exceeding even that of \\nFacebook, a social-media giant, which was \\nvalued at $104bn when it listed in 2012. \\n\\nImpressive as all that sounds, does it \\njustify the price tag? To be sure, compared \\nwith many cash-guzzling unicorns (tech \\nstartups worth more than $1bn), Coinbase \\nlooks mature. In the past quarter users \\ntraded about $335bn-worth of currencies \\non its platform. They also held $223bn in \\nits accounts—more than a tenth of the val- \\nue of all cryptocurrencies. \\n\\nFounded in 2012, Coinbase always \\nwanted to be more than a place where peo- \\nple buy and sell digital monies. It aimed in- \\nstead to become a bridge between the anar- \\nchic cryptoworld and conventional fi- \\nnance. Though its history has been tumul- \\ntuous at times, the firm is not far from its \\ngoal: users do not need a degree in crypto- \\ngraphy to benefit from its services (though \\nits customer support is notoriously want- \\ning); itis on mostly good terms with regu- \\nlators and banks; and, unlike other crypto- \\nexchanges, it has so far avoided becoming \\nthe victim of a catastrophic hack. \\n\\nYet in other respects the firm’s pros- \\npects are uncertain. Although it has \\nbranched out somewhat, and now offers \\nservices to store and save cryptoassets, \\ntransaction fees still made up 96% of its \\nrevenue last year. This not only means that \\nits fortunes rely heavily on the health of  » it also means that its take could shrink if \\ncompetition muscles in.

The stockmarket is dominated \\nby retail investors who are highly sensitive \\nto political suggestions on the direction of \\ntrading. The practice of pledging shares as \\ncollateral to brokers also leads to sudden \\ndrops in share prices when margin calls go \\nunmet and collateral is liquidated. Mr Xiao \\nignored growing leverage and trumpeted \\nexuberance. As the crash began in June \\n2015 he indicated the rally would go on.

Four of the six \\npresidents from 1982 to 2018 did that. They \\nincarcerated two union leaders, a former \\npresident’s brother and the head of Pemex, \\nthe state oil company. They presented \\nthese as giant victories in the fight against \\ncorruption. But they were not. Two of the \\njailbirds were acquitted, one was pardoned \\nand the sentence of the fourth was over- \\nturned. Corruption continued to be ram- \\npant, uninvestigated and unpunished. \\nMany Mexicans regard the administra- \\ntion of Enrique Pena Nieto, which gov- \\nerned until December 2018, as the most cor- \\nrupt in history. Rosario Robles, a minister \\nin his government, is suspected of helping \\nto siphon off $400m of the government’s \\nmoney through ghost companies and has \\nSpent the past year in preventive deten- \\ntion. A construction firm with government  contracts helped Mr Pena’s wife acquire a \\nhouse worth $7m. \\n\\nThose scandals helped Andrés Manuel \\nLopez Obrador, a left-wing populist, win \\nthe presidential election in 2018 in a land- \\nSlide. Mr LOpez Obrador, often called AMLO, \\nportrays himself as incorruptible and \\npromises to “eliminate, not reduce” graft. \\nLike past presidents, he has sought out \\nwrongdoers from earlier administrations. \\n\\nLast year, at the request of the attorney- \\ngeneral, ajudge issued an arrest warrant for \\nEmilio Lozoya, who was international-af- \\nfairs co-ordinator for Mr Pena’s campaign \\nand the boss of Pemex from 2012 to 2016. He \\nreturned from Spain in July this year. \\n\\nThe idea that Mr Lozoya would be just  another presidential scapegoat was demol- \\nished in dramatic fashion. On August 19th \\nthe press got hold of his deposition, in \\nwhich he offers to provide evidence of a \\ncorrupt mega-scheme involving 17 promi- \\nnent Mexicans, including Mr Pena and two \\nother former presidents.

Instead, Mr \\nAbe spent the afternoon at Keio University \\nHospital in Tokyo undergoing medical \\nchecks and denying reports that he was \\nabout to step down. \\n\\nIll health has long dogged Mr Abe. His \\nfirst stint as prime minister came to an \\nabrupt end in 2007, after a turbulent year \\nmarred by, among other things, a flare-up \\nof ulcerative colitis, a chronic intestinal \\ndisease. A new drug has helped Mr Abe \\nmanage the symptoms since he took up the \\njob again in 2012. Yet as he has receded \\nfrom public view in recent months, ru- \\nmours about his health have proliferated. \\nJapanese media have taken to analysing \\nfootage of his gait to see if it has slowed. It \\nnow takes him 21seconds to walk down the \\ncorridor outside his office, compared with \\n18 seconds in April, reports TBS, a television  Station. The visit to the hospital on the 24th \\nwas his second in as many weeks. On Au- \\ngust 28th Mr Abe plans a press conference \\nto clarify the state of his health. \\n\\nAides admit that the stress of leading \\nthe country through the pandemic has tak- \\nenatollon Mr Abe, but they balk at the idea \\nthat he is too ill to carry on. His third and, \\nby the party's regulations, final term as \\nleader of the ruling Liberal Democratic \\nParty (LDP) lasts until September next year. \\nA general election is due around the same \\ntime. On August 26th Suga Yoshihide, the \\nchief cabinet secretary, declared that it was \\n“premature to talk about ‘post-Abe’”. None- \\ntheless, the prime minister’s perceived  frailty has fuelled exactly that kind of talk. \\nWithin the LppP, “many are sniffing blood,” \\nsays one of Mr Abe’s advisers. \\n\\nThe succession could play out in three \\nways. If Mr Abe is hospitalised or temporar- \\nily incapacitated, the deputy prime minis- \\nter, ASO Taro, would become the interim \\nleader. Mr Abe could step down early, al- \\nlowing the LDP to elect a replacement to \\ncomplete the duration of his current term. \\nThe party’s rules allow an emergency elec- \\ntion at a meeting of its MPs, bypassing the \\nnormal party-wide vote.

Details of the case were scant, but that \\ndid not stop it lighting up the internet, \\nshining a new spotlight on the question of \\nhow far Chinese women have come. Phoe-  nix Weekly, a magazine, launched an online \\npoll that drew 47,000 respondents. Almost \\ntwo-thirds said that a surname could come \\nfrom either parent. \\n\\nAs in most traditional societies, Chi- \\nnese parents have long preferred sons, and \\nthe usual practice of handing down the fa- \\nther’s surname remains a powerful symbol \\nof that (though women have always re- \\ntained their surname at marriage). But with \\nsocial mores changing rapidly, more par- \\nents have started to give babies the moth- \\ners surname, especially in wealthy urban \\nareas. A paper last month in the Journal of \\nPopulation Economics found that Chinese \\nchildren with young, educated mothers \\nfrom areas with normal sex ratios at birth \\nwere more likely than average to be given \\nher surname, and such offspring were \\nhealthier and better educated than average. \\nAlmost one in ten newborns in Shanghai \\nwere given their mother’s name in 2018. \\n\\nSome young couples have compro- \\nmised and use both surnames in combina- \\ntion, somewhat like Westerners creating \\ndouble-barrelled surnames (though only \\none of those names can be legally recog- \\nnised in China). According to a survey in \\n2019, the surnames of more than 1.1m Chi- \\nnese people now form such acombination, \\na ten-fold increase 0n 1990. \\n\\nGovernment support for matronymics \\nhas been around since the mid-1990sS. Giv- \\ning the mother’s surname to offspring was \\nencouraged within the one-child policy \\n(which was relaxed in 2016), to persuade \\npeople to be content with an only daughter. \\nTo win them over, officials dug up Chinese \\ntexts about ancient matrilineal societies. \\n\\nSome wonder, however, whether all of \\nthis is more to do with genealogy than with \\nfeminism. Qi Xiaoying of the Australian \\nCatholic University says that grandfathers \\nare urging their daughters to give their sur- \\nname to one of their grandchildren now \\nthat families can have more than one, be- \\ncause it assures the continuation of the \\ngrandparents’ line.

Such \\nneglect exacerbated their grief. Every few \\ndays another elder would start gasping for \\nair. Those who made it back from hospital \\ntold horror stories of frigid wards packed \\nwith dying patients and doctors who didn't  speak their language.

Yet the arrival of Delivery \\nHero in the DAX 30 on August 24th igniteda \\nfierce debate. How, critics grumble, cana \\nfood-delivery company that has never \\nmade money or paid a dividend, and no \\nlonger even does business in Germany, sit \\nalongside Siemens, a 173-year-old engi- \\nneering behemoth, and Volkswagen, Eu- \\nrope’s biggest carmaker, in the elite group \\nof the bluest of German blue chips? \\n\\nThe simple answer is that membership \\nof the DAx is determined mainly by market \\nvalue and turnover of shares, with no prof- \\nitability test (unlike America’s S&P 500 in- \\ndex of big firms, which requires four con- \\nsecutive quarters in the black, among other \\ncriteria). And in that respect, Delivery Hero \\nqualifies handily. Niklas Ostberg, its Swed- \\nish chief executive, boasts that the firm’s \\nmarket capitalisation of €18.7bn ($22bn) is \\nhigher than that of several DAxX members. \\nIts share price has tripled over the past cou- \\nple of years and it has attracted invest- \\nments from the world’s richest companies, \\nincluding Alibaba and Amazon, two global \\ninternet giants. \\n\\nIronically, a big reason for investors’ en- \\nthusiasm is Delivery Hero’s non-German \\nfocus. A few years ago it offloaded its Ger- \\nman businesses, Foodora, Lieferheld and \\nPizza.de, to Takeaway, a Dutch competitor. \\nSince then it has eyed expansion in the \\nMiddle East and Asia. At the end of last year \\n50% of the company’s revenue came from \\nthe Middle East and north Africa, 30% from \\nASia and 12% from Europe. “It is today es- \\nsentially an emerging-markets business,’ \\nsays Monique Pollard of Citigroup. \\n\\nMany food-delivery firms do not oper- \\nate their own fleets of vehicles but instead \\nmatch consumers with restaurants and \\nriders. That means they must share their \\ncut with both restaurants and riders. “It is \\nvery hard to make a profit with the three- \\nWay-split model in Europe,’ explains An- \\ndrew Gwynn of Exane BNP Paribas.

The pandemic led toa \\ncollapse in elective medical procedures re- \\nquiring their sophisticated kit, dealing a \\npowerful blow to sales. At the same time, \\nthe crisis created opportunities for firms \\nmaking ventilators and testing kit. \\n\\nFor an illustration of how this dynamic \\nhas played out, consider Medtronic. On Au- \\ngust 25th the American giant, with a mar- \\nket capitalisation of $138bn, reported its fi- \\nnancial results for the three months to July. \\nOn the face of it, its performance was abys- \\nmal. Revenues fell by 17% compared with \\nthe same quarter a year ago, to $6.5bn. Net \\nincome plunged by nearly half. Citing the \\npandemic, the firm refused to provide \\nearnings guidance. \\n\\nAnd yet investors and analysts cheered. \\nOne reason is that they had feared worse: \\nMedtronic handily beat forecasts for both \\nrevenues and earnings. Another is that \\nsales of ventilators shot up five-fold, cush- \\nioning overall revenues. Geoff Martha, the \\nfirm’s boss, now expects a return to “nor- \\nmal growth’ within a few quarters. \\n\\nThe revival at Medtronic might augur a  broader return to form for medical-device \\nfirms. Matt Miksic of Credit Suisse, an 1n- \\nvestment bank, notes that these compa- \\nnies came into the crisis “with the wind at \\ntheir backs”. They were propelled by strong \\ngrowth in global revenues. Last year KPMG, \\na consultancy, had forecast global sales to \\nrise from to $795bn in 2030, from $371bn in \\n2015. Tim van Biesen of Bain, a consultan- \\ncy, points to a pre-pandemic boom in sales \\nof highly profitable devices used in ortho- \\npaedics, neurosurgery and cardiovascular \\nprocedures. As result, in the past five years \\nShare prices have outpaced both Big \\nPharma and the S&P 500 index of large \\nfirms (see chart). \\n\\nWhether or not this outperformance \\ncan last depends in large part on the path of \\nthe pandemic. To flog their lucrative de- \\nvices and associated services, kit-makers \\nrely on an army of highly trained sales rep- \\nresentatives to win over doctors and train \\nthem. A survey by Bain found that nine in \\nten medics wanted in-person interactions \\nwith device salespeople before covid-19. As \\nMr van Biesen explains, many surgeons \\nvalue advice from top-flight reps, who \\nknow their company’s cutting-edge tech- \\nnologies better than doctors do, during \\ncomplex surgeries. Some even depend on \\nthose reps to lay out preferred instruments \\nbefore operations. Now Bain finds that \\nmore than 60% of surgeons foresee restric- \\ntions on such in-person contacts. \\n\\nA prolonged period of restricted access \\ncould affect the industry in unexpected \\nways. Big companies may lose business \\nfrom ambulatory-care centres, reckons Mr \\nvan Biesen.

Californians buy half of all electric \\ncars sold in America. Theirs is the country’s \\nlargest solar market. As California deals \\nwith heat waves, fires and a goal of carbon- \\nfree electricity by 2045, the need for a reli- \\nable grid is becoming ever more obvious. \\nFor years firms competed to generate clean \\npower in California. Now a growing num- \\nber are vying to store and manage it, too. \\n\\nAugust's blackouts have many causes, \\nincluding poor planning, an unexpected \\nlack of capacity and sweltering heat in not \\njust California but nearby states from \\nwhich it sometimes imports power. Long \\nbefore the outages, however, electricity op- \\nerators were anxious about capacity. Cali- \\nfornia’s solar panels become less useful in \\nthe evening, when demand peaks. In No- \\nvember state regulators mandated that \\nutilities procure an additional 3.3 gigawatts \\n(GW) of capacity, including giant batteries \\nthat charge when energy is abundant and \\ncan Sell electricity back to the grid. \\n\\nToo few such projects have come online \\nto cope with the surge in demand for air- \\nconditioning in the scorching summer.

InJuly \\nthe county of Monterey said Vistra Energy, \\na Texan power company, could build as \\nmuch as1.2Gw of storage. \\n\\nThe rooftop solar industry stands to \\nbenefit from a new Californian mandate \\nthat requires new homes to install panels \\non their roofs from this year.

In \\na preface to the prospectus, bleak by the up- \\nbeat standards of the genre, Mr Karp writes \\nof government agencies that “faltered” and \\ncrises that “expose the systemic weakness- \\nes of the institutions on which we depend”. \\nFixing these shortcomings is the com- \\npany’s raison d étre.

But its labour \\nmarket, like Europe’s, still depends on the government  ANADA'S ECONOMY is often subject to \\nC unfavourable comparisons with that of \\nthe United States, but recently it has been \\nrivalling its neighbour’s. Like the United \\nStates it has recently enjoyed a big im- \\nprovement in economic sentiment. In July \\nthe Bank of Canada predicted that at the \\nend of 2020 GDP would be 6.8% smaller \\nthan a year earlier; on October 28th it re- \\nvised that forecast toa 4.3% hit. \\n\\nBy many measures, Canada’s labour \\nmarket seems to be rebounding even faster \\nthan America’s; in September Canadian \\nemployment was only 3.7% beneath its pre- \\npandemic peak, while in the United States \\njobs remained 7.1% scarcer, calculate econ- \\nomists at TD Bank (see chart). Yet the coun- \\ntry has not quite overhauled Uncle Sam in \\nthe quest for a v-shaped recovery from the \\nspring slump. That may be because, as in \\nEurope, many of its jobs remain propped \\nup by the government. \\n\\nIn the spring Canada had a tight lock- \\ndown and a big fall in GpP, of over 1% \\n(compared with about 9% south of the bor- \\nder). But in the recovery it has benefited  from several advantages. For most of the \\nyear it has been relatively successful in \\ncontrolling the spread of covid-19. Unlike \\nnearly all American states, Canadian prov- \\ninces can run operating deficits. They have \\nused their borrowing powers to boost hir- \\ning of teachers and health-care workers \\nduring the pandemic. Provincial deficits  are expected to rise to C$96bn ($72bn), \\n4.5% of Canada’s GDP, this financial year, \\nfrom C$18bn in 2019. American states, by \\ncontrast, are having to slash spending as \\ntax revenues have fallen. \\n\\nIn Washington, disagreement over \\nwhether to bail out the states has impeded \\nthe passing of a second round of fiscal \\nstimulus. But Canada has reduced for now \\nthe usual friction between province and \\nnation. The federal government has given \\nthe provinces an extra C$21bn to reopen \\nschools and cover extra health-care costs. \\n\\nIn August Doug Ford, the Conservative \\nwho governs Ontario, the most populous \\nprovince, praised Justin Trudeau for doing \\n“an incredible job as prime minister”. Over- \\nall, the 16% of GDP Canada has spent stim- \\nulating the economy is even bigger than \\nthe United States’ massive package of 14% \\nof Gpp. “I don't like deficits. But the alter- \\nNatives were much worse,” said Erin \\nO’Toole, the recently elected leader of the \\nopposition Conservatives. \\n\\nThe expansion in Canadian education \\nand health care has helped women, who \\nare most of the workforce in those sectors. \\nMothers, who were likelier than others to \\nstop work during the pandemic, returned \\nwhen schools and day-care centres fully re- \\nopened in September.

When the \\noccupant of the White House starts his four \\nyear term in January, in what state will \\nAmerican business be? \\n\\nSome recent vital signs may look pro- \\nmising.

Small \\nwonder that the Conference Board, a re- \\nsearch organisation, published a survey on \\nOctober 20th finding that its measure of \\nconfidence of bosses at big companies has \\njumped to 64 from 45 in the previous quar-  ter—a figure above 50 indicates more posi- \\ntive than negative responses. \\n\\nYet anyone tuning into big firms’ quar- \\nterly update calls with Wall Street investors \\ncould not help but pick up the tentative \\ntone and frequent dour notes of executives. \\nVisa, a payments company, for example, \\ncalled the recovery “uneven”. Caterpillar, a \\nmaker of industrial machinery, admitted it \\nis “holding more inventory than we nor- \\nmally would” because of the uncertainties \\nresulting from the pandemic. And a close \\nanalysis of the figures suggests that the \\ncorporate recovery is very patchy, with \\nsome industries and smaller firms still in \\nbig trouble. Meanwhile, corporate balance- \\nSheets are under strain, which could hold \\nback investment and lead to an eventual \\nrise in defaults. \\n\\nAmerica’s economic boom in the latest \\nquarter would be impressive had it not \\ncome on the heels of a comparable decline \\nin GDP in the previous three-month period. \\nThe economy remains 3.5% smaller than it  » Also in this section \\n\\n56 Xiaomis surging sales \\n\\n57 The turkey glut \\n\\n58 Clash of the video games  was at the end of 2019, reckons the Confer- \\nence Board, and it is not likely to return to \\nits pre-pandemic level until the tail end of \\n2021 or possibly later (see chart on next \\npage).

The dollar’s domi- \\nnance means that everyone holds them, \\nfrom American banks and European pen- \\nsion schemes to Arab sovereign-wealth \\nfunds and Asian exporters. The yield on \\nTreasuries is known as the “risk-free” in- \\nterest rate, and underpins the value of ev- \\nery other asset, from stocks to mortgages. \\nIn times of stress investors sell racier assets \\nand pile into Treasuries.  As The Economist went to press the out- \\ncome of America’s presidential election \\nwas still unknown, but the likelihood ofa \\nBiden presidency and a Republican-con- \\ntrolled Senate was rising.

Speaking ata \\nSummit in Shanghai on October 24th, he \\nchided regulators for being too focused on \\npreventing financial risks. Red tape, he \\nsaid, only held up innovation. Ten days lat- \\ner his words came back to haunt him. Less \\nthan 48 hours before its stock was to begin \\ntrading in Hong Kong and Shanghai, Ant \\nwas forced by Chinese regulators to halt the \\nflotation. \\n\\nThe group Said in a regulatory notice to \\nthe Hong Kong exchange that the IPo, \\nscheduled for November 5th, had been sus- \\npended because the company “may not \\nmeet listing qualifications or disclosure re- \\nquirements’, after the regulator conducted \\nan interview with Mr Ma and other execu- \\ntives. The filings also mentioned “recent \\nchanges in the fintech regulatory environ- \\nment’, hinting that newly published rules \\nmay have got in the way. The sudden sus- \\npension also suggests that some powerful \\nofficials may be displeased with Mr Ma, a \\nself-made man who, by the conservative \\nstandards of big business in China, has an \\noutspoken streak. \\n\\nYet the turn of events is not just painful \\nfor Ant. It reflects poorly on China's regula- \\ntors. IPOS are rarely stopped at such a late \\nStage. The deal was more than 800 times \\noversubscribed in Shanghai, and in Hong  day early. It was set to float in Shanghai on \\nthe STAR market, China’s answer to Nas- \\ndaq, designed to lure home Chinese tech \\ngroups that have listed abroad. Instead, the \\nlast-minute halt of Ant’s listing highlights \\nthe opacity of the Chinese political system \\nand the risks that can trip up even its most \\nsuccessful companies. \\n\\nIt is also easily the most public, and \\nmost disruptive, of Ant’s run-ins with regu- \\nlators. The company has consistently ad- \\njusted its business as the rules around it \\nhave shifted. The 1Po debacle appears to be \\npartly related to one such case. Back in 2018 \\nofficials placed caps on asset-backed se- \\ncuritisation, upending Ant’s model of sell- \\ning its loans on to banks. So it pioneered a \\nnew approach: consumers and merchants \\nborrowed through Alipay, its payments \\nservice, on their smartphones, but the \\nmoney came from banks. Ant was simply \\nthe conduit, collecting a “technology-ser- \\nvice fee’. This conduit business boomed, \\nwith credit growing to outstrip payments \\nas Ant’s biggest source of revenue. \\n\\nOn November 2nd the Chinese central \\nbank and banking regulator published new \\ndraft rules for online micro-lending, which \\nlooked almost perfectly tailored to under- \\ncut Ant. Online lenders will need to fund at \\nleast 30% of any loan they supply jointly \\nwith banks. That could force Ant to keep \\nmuch more of the credit that it originates \\non its books; currently, 98% is held as as- \\nsets by other firms, off Ant’s balance-sheet. \\nAdditional disclosure requirements could \\nalso make it much m\"],\n",

Fully 71% of infect- \\ned people did not transmit the virus on. \\nMost new transmissions were from a few \\n“super-spreaders': about 10% of the people \\ncaused 60% of new infections, giving covid \\nto three other people, on average. \\n\\nThe K-factor does however depend on \\nhow people interact.

A flick through \\nthe pamphlets of the two leading candi¬ \\ndates in the Welsh city’s by-election, which \\nis set for April 4th, provides a break from \\nthe endless talk about Britain leaving the \\neu. Labour’s candidate, Ruth Jones, makes \\nno mention of it, instead promising more \\npolice on Newport’s mean streets. Matthew \\nEvans, the Conservative challenger, has \\nsidelined Brexit in favour of a simpler main \\nmessage to voters in the traffic-clogged \\ncity: \"Build the M4 relief road now.” \\n\\nKnocking on a few doors on a street of \\nplush houses explains why both candi¬ \\ndates avoid the B-word. For each voter de¬ \\nlighted by Britain’s impending departure \\nfrom the eu, another despairs. After a short \\nsoliloquy extolling the virtues of Margaret \\nThatcher, one self-declared lifelong Con¬ \\nservative voter says he does not know \\nwhether he can back the party again. \"My \\nparty has ripped apart our ability to trade in \\nthe world,\" he moans. Others on the road \\nhave the opposite complaint: why have we \\nnot gone yet? \\n\\nWhen it comes to Brexit, the seat of \\nNewport West is bang on the national aver¬ \\nage. Across the country, the median con¬ \\nstituency result was a 53.6% Leave victory. \\nIn Newport West, 53.7% voted out. Therein \\nlies the problem for candidates both in \\nNewport and beyond: for every voter po¬ \\ntentially won over by a firm line on Brexit, \\nanother is likely to be repelled. For an mp in \\nthe most typical seats—slightly Leave or \\nmildly Remain, rather than overwhelm¬ \\ningly either—the great political issue of the \\nmoment is something best ignored. \\n\\nIt adds to the impression that the New¬ \\nport contest is taking place in a vacuum, \\nsealed off from national politics. It is not \\njust Brexit that goes unmentioned. Neither \\nparty leader features prominently. Jeremy \\nCorbyn dropped by on March 22nd for the \\nfuneral of Paul Flynn, the Labour mp who \\ndied last month aged 84, having held the \\nseat since 1987.

Dutch voters \\nwhose Hegel was shaky turned to Google \\nto work out what the Eurosceptic, cli¬ \\nmate-change-sceptic foe of immigration \\nwas on about, and concluded that he was \\nproclaiming the election a dialectical \\nshift in Dutch history. \\n\\nCombined with fashion-model looks, \\nsuch stunts have made Mr Baudet the \\nhottest political news in the Nether¬ \\nlands. In his first appearance as an mp in \\n2017, he violated parliamentary rules by \\ntrying to make a speech in Latin. Many \\ncompare his rise to that of Pirn Fortuyn, \\nthe similarly debonair anti-Muslim \\nprofessor and politician who was assas¬ \\nsinated in 2002. Unlike Geert Wilders, \\nthe Netherlands’ other anti-immigrant \\npopulist, Mr Baudet campaigns among \\nyounger and better-educated voters, \\nstaging open forums on right-wing \\nphilosophy. But of the major parties, only \\nMr Wilders’s had a lower education level. \\nAlmost all had switched from other \\nright-wing parties. Rather than leading a \\nrevolution, Mr Baudet may simply be \\nreplacing Mr Wilders as the Netherlands’ \\nmain right-wing populist. \\n\\n\"The real story of the elections is \\n‘Dutch disease’, the complete levelling \\nand splintering of the party landscape,” \\nsays Tom van der Meer of the University \\nof Amsterdam. The fvd came first, but \\nwon just 15% of the vote, compared with \\n14% for the Liberals and 11% for the \\nGreenLeft party. The country now has 13 \\nparties represented in parliament. \\n\\nThe fvd’s new delegates in provincial \\nlegislatures will vote in May to choose \\nthe country’s Senate, parliament’s less  powerful arm. The fvd will probably get \\n13 of the 75 senators, depriving the ruling \\ncoalition of a majority. \\n\\nParadoxically, this could force the \\ngovernment to move left, co-operating \\nwith GreenLeft or the Labour party. It is \\ntrying to pass energy legislation to meet \\nthe country’s commitments under the \\nParis climate-change treaty. Mr Baudet \\nhas claimed the measures would cost a \\ntrillion euros over several decades; in¬ \\ndependent experts put the figure at \\n€3bn-4bn ($3.4bn-4.5bn) per year by \\n2030. \\n\\nYet even if the fvd has little effect on \\npolicy, it is changing the ideological \\nlandscape. The party supports leaving \\nthe eu (“Nexit”), though it has put that \\ndemand on the back burner. It is making \\nclimate-change scepticism acceptable on \\nthe right. Mr Baudet has warned of the \\n\"homeopathic dilution” of the Dutch \\npeople, and his apocalyptic speeches \\naccuse an elite \"cartel” of all the other \\nparties of bringing Dutch civilisation to \\nits knees.

       "  'Donald Trump sees the benefit of an attorney-general with a capacious view of presidential authority  \\nM any democrats are dismayed by Robert Mueller’s failure to \\ntake down the president. Yet they have a consolatory new \\nhate figure in the form of William Barr, who began his second spell \\nas attorney-general last month. A grandfatherly 68-year-old, who \\nfirst presided over the Justice Department for George H.W. Bush, \\nMr Barr has been castigated for his handling of Mr Mueller’s report, \\nwhich remains under wraps at his discretion. Jerrold Nadler, \\nDemocratic chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, called \\nhis summary of the report \"a hasty, partisan interpretation of the \\nfacts.” Several Democrats running for president, including Kamala \\nHarris and Elizabeth Warren, derided Mr Barr as Donald Trump’s \\n\"hand-picked attorney-general” (as if there were any other kind). \\n\\nThis is partly a case of shooting the messenger. Many on the left \\nwere convinced Mr Trump was up to his neck in the Russian plot \\nthat helped get him elected. They also had an almost cultlilce faith \\nin Mr Mueller (the ash-dry prosecutor would be amazed to see how \\nmany T-shirts bear his name on campus—as in \"Mueller Time- \\nJustice Served Cold!”). The instant Mr Barr relayed the crushing \\nnews that the special counsel had found no collusion with Russia \\nby Mr Trump, he was suspected of skulduggery, which seems hys¬ \\nterical. A close friend of the special counsel, Mr Barr is possibly too \\nprincipled and certainly too canny to have misrepresented his \\nconclusions. If he had done so, they would leak. Yet the attorney- \\ngeneral’s treatment of the second prong of Mr Mueller’s investiga¬ \\ntion, concerning Mr Trump’s alleged effort to obstruct the various \\nRussia investigations, is more troubling. \\n\\nIt is not clear why Mr Mueller refrained from ruling on the evi¬ \\ndence against Mr Trump on this issue. It is also unclear whether he \\nexpected Mr Barr to rule for him. Perhaps Mr Mueller felt the deci¬ \\nsion was above his paygrade, given the Justice Department’s policy \\nof not indicting a sitting president. Perhaps Mr Barr—and his dep¬ \\nuty Rod Rosenstein, who supported his view that Mr Mueller had \\nnot made a convincing obstruction case—made a straightforward \\ndecision. Yet that would make the emphasis Mr Mueller laid upon \\nthe possibility of Mr Trump’s guilt—in stressing that his report did \\n\"not exonerate” the president—even odder than it already seems. \\nThe result, absent further disclosure to provide explanation and \\nreassurance, is just the sort of heaving political mess of intrigue  and innuendo Mr Mueller was appointed to clear up. \\n\\nWhatever they intended, he and Mr Barr have combined to \\ndamage Mr Trump while clearing him.

An Indian missile had hur¬ \\ntled 300km into space and blown up a sat¬ \\nellite, putting India in the small club of \\ncountries that had developed and tested \\nanti-satellite (asat) weapons. \"India \\nstands tall as a space power!” he exulted. \\n\\nMr Modi’s address was unusual. Voting \\nin a seven-stage national election begins \\non April 11th. Prime ministerial broadcasts \\nduring election season—when a \"model \\ncode of conduct” applies, barring the rul¬ \\ning party from abusing its position—have \\noccurred only twice before: after the assas¬ \\nsination of the prime minister in 1984 and \\nof the leader of the opposition in 1991. Ma- \\nmata Banerjee, the leader of a regional op¬ \\nposition party, demanded that the Election \\nCommission investigate Mr Modi’s speech \\nfor breaching its code. \\n\\nAn asat test would hardly qualify as a \\nnational-security emergency. Indeed, In¬ \\ndia might have carried it out at any time in \\nthe past eight years. In 2012 V.K. Saraswat, \\nthen the head of the Defence Research and \\nDevelopment Organisation, the govern¬ \\nment agency that develops new military \\ngear, noted that the \"building blocks” of an \\nasat capability were in place and required \\nonly electronic fine-tuning. It is hard to \\navoid the conclusion that Mr Modi’s space \\nspectacular was timed for the polls. It \\ncomes a month after India sent warplanes \\nto bomb Pakistan for the first time since \\n1971—another move seen by many as grand- \\nstanding for the voters. \\n\\nElectioneering aside, the test had two \\naims. One was to lay down a marker at a \\ntime of growing military competition in \\nspace. China, India’s regional rival, oper¬ \\nates around 30 satellites, many of which \\nwould be used by its armed forces in any \\nconflict. It has also developed an array of \\nasat weapons, including missiles and la¬ \\nsers, of its own. \\n\\nIndia is keen to show it can hit back. But \\nin flaunting its ability to shoot small, fast- \\nmoving objects at enormous heights, India \\nwas also signalling its interest in swatting \\nother, harder-to-hit things—Pakistani nuc¬ \\nlear missiles, say—out of the sky. \\n\\nYet that muscle-flexing may come at \\nsome diplomatic cost. It is the first avowed \\nasat test since China blew up one of its \\nown satellites in 2007, provoking interna¬ \\ntional condemnation. The debris from that  explosion generated a quarter of all cata¬ \\nlogued objects in low-earth orbit a few \\nyears later, putting other countries’ satel¬ \\nlites at risk.

Even so, Ms Tutiek needs to \\nwhip up as much support as possible. A re¬ \\ncent change to electoral laws means that \\nparties need at least 4 % of the popular vote \\nto gain seats in the national parliament, up \\nfrom 2 % in 2004 . Polls show pan hovering \\ndangerously near this threshold.

Of the ten \\nin parliament, four will not meet the 4% \\nthreshold and two others are hovering just \\nabove it, according to current polling. The \\nthreshold is one of a series of recent rules \\nwhich are making Indonesia’s elections \\nless competitive. \\n\\nIndonesia is still a young democracy. \\nFollowing independence from the Nether¬ \\nlands in 1945, it experimented briefly with \\ncompetitive elections before slipping into \\nfour decades of authoritarian rule under \\nfirst Sukarno and then Suharto. The latter \\nallowed parliamentary elections, but with \\nonly two cowed opposition parties. Pliant \\nparliamentarians then selected the presi¬ \\ndent from a shortlist of one. It was only \\nafter Suharto resigned in the face of mass \\nprotests in 1998 that the country reverted to \\nfree elections. \\n\\nOn the face of things, democracy has \\nthrived since then. The subsequent presi¬ \\ndential elections have all been genuinely \\ncompetitive. Democracy pervades every \\nlevel of government. Voters get to choose a \\nchief executive and a parliament not just \\nfor the country as a whole, but also for \\nprovinces and the next layer of administra¬ \\ntion, cities and districts. The press is free  and public protests are common. \\n\\nBut Indonesia’s political parties are not \\nas keen on competition as its voters appear \\nto be.

On \\nMarch 28th green-minded companies \\nthere transformed the Renewable Energy \\nBuyers Alliance (reba), a non-profit orga¬ \\nnisation, into a fully fledged lobby group to \\nfurther the cause. \\n\\nreba now wants corporate purchases of \\ngreen electricity to ramp up dramatically. \\nIn a sign of how broad the clean-power \\nmovement has become, its members in¬ \\nclude big names in technology (Google), \\ncarmaking (General Motors), banking (Citi¬ \\ngroup), media (Disney) and more. But \\nreba’s creation also hints that, as firms \\nrace to go green, they are running into a \\nnumber of problems. In the process of col¬ \\nlectively solving them, they could reshape \\npower markets. \\n\\nFor companies, clean power often looks \\nlike a no-brainer. The costs of electricity \\nfrom wind and solar farms have plunged by \\nabout 70% and 90%, respectively, since \\n2009. Going green lets companies burnish \\ntheir environmental credentials with in¬  vestors, workers and customers. \\n\\nThe reality is more complex. The sim¬ \\nplest way for a company to source clean \\nelectricity is to blanket its property with \\nsolar panels. Walmart has been doing this \\nsince 2007, harvesting the sun’s rays from \\nthe vast roofs of its megastores. Such \\nschemes generate only so much energy, \\nhowever. Google’s electricity demand, \\nchiefly from its ravenous data centres, is \\nnearly that of Estonia. Companies must \\ntherefore buy their renewable power from \\nthird parties. \\n\\nIn a normal procurement process, com¬ \\npanies would seek bids from a variety of \\nsuppliers. Electricity is different, particu¬ \\nlarly in places with a regulated, monopolis¬ \\ntic supplier—which is true of many Ameri¬ \\ncan states. Two-thirds of corporate \\npurchases of renewable electricity in \\nAmerica are therefore virtual, in what \\namounts to a swap. A company buys energy \\nfor its operations as usual from a local utili¬ \\nty. It also signs a virtual power purchase \\nagreement (vppa) for electricity with a re¬ \\nnewables provider in a deregulated mar¬ \\nket, which could be in another state, typi¬ \\ncally paying a fixed rate. The company then \\nresells this clean electricity, at variable \\nwholesale prices, into that faraway grid, \\nthereby helping to offset its overall carbon \\nfootprint. \\n\\nYou would expect plunging prices for \\nrenewables to benefit those who buy it. In a \\nvppa, they could lose. That is because, in a \\nmarket flooded with cheap renewables, \\nwholesale prices at which a company re¬ \\nsells clean kilowatt-hours could drop be¬ '],\n",

Why, in particular, is inflation \\nso stubbornly high in one and low in the \\nother? In Argentina, consumer prices were \\n50% higher in February than a year earlier, \\nthe fastest increase since 1991. In Japan over \\nthe same period, inflation was less than \\n0.2%, equalling the lowest rate since 2016. \\n\\nThe inertia in both countries is puz¬ \\nzling. Inflation has stayed low in Japan de¬ \\nspite a drum-tight labour market (unem¬ \\nployment has remained at 2.5% or below \\nfor over a year) and high in Argentina de¬ \\nspite a fast-shrinking economy: its gdp \\ncontracted by more than 6% year-on-year \\nin the fourth quarter of 2018. \\n\\nThe two countries, of course, have long \\nmystified economists. In 1950 Argentina’s \\ngdp per person was three times that of Ja¬ \\npan, according to the Maddison Project da¬ \\ntabase. The Eva Peron charitable founda¬ \\ntion, run by the president’s wife, shipped \\n100 tonnes of relief supplies to the war-bat¬ \\ntered Japanese. Thousands of Japanese mi¬ \\ngrated in the opposite direction, creating a \\npopulation of 23,000 Nipo-Argentinos by \\nthe end of the 1960s. \\n\\nBut the two countries’ economic paths \\nwent on to cross decisively. Japan’s gdp per \\nperson eclipsed Argentina’s around 1970 \\nand is now about twice as high, measured \\nat purchasing-power parity. Its success and \\nArgentina’s failure defied predictions. Si¬ \\nmon Kuznets, who won the Nobel prize in \\neconomics in 1971 for his work on growth, \\nput it best: there are four types of countries \\nin the world—developed, undeveloped, Ja¬ \\npan and Argentina. \\n\\nPolicymakers in both countries have \\ntried hard to make them macroeconom- \\nically \"normal”. After Shinzo Abe became \\nJapan’s prime minister in 2012, the central \\nbank promised to raise inflation to 2% in \\nabout two years by expanding its asset pur¬ \\nchases. And after Mauricio Macri won Ar¬ \\ngentina’s presidency at the end of 2015, the \\ncentral bank promised to raise interest \\nrates enough to bring inflation down below \\n17% in 2017 and 12% in 2018, paving the way \\nfor an inflation target of 5% thereafter. \\n\\nIn both cases, these bold new policy \\nframeworks seemed to offer a decisive \\nbreak with a sorry past. In Japan, previous \\ncentral-bank officials had resigned them¬ \\nselves to mild deflation or even welcomed \\nit, redefining failure as success. In Argenti-  \\n2017 18 19 \\n\\nSource: Haver Analytics \\n\\nna, the previous government had respond¬ \\ned to high inflation by simply fiddling the \\nfigures, misreporting failure as success. \\n\\nBut the early optimism has faltered. \\nBoth governments have been forced to re¬ \\nvisit their targets and their instruments for \\nachieving them. When price pressures \\nproved more stubborn than Argentina ex¬ \\npected in 2017, the government relaxed its \\nunachievable inflation targets to bring \\nthem closer in line with reality.

But one of these problems is different from the others. \\n\\nThe migration crisis was a product of epic forces outside Eu- \\nrope’s borders; the Greek row stemmed from a mismatch be- \\ntween democracy and the rules of euro membership. But Brit- \\nain’s “renegotiation” of its eu membership, ahead of an in/out \\nreferendum to be held (probably) next year, looks like a self-in- \\nflicted wound. Why should semi-detached Britain seek yet more \\nspecial treatment? Europeans are exasperated. Foreign friends, \\nfrom Hong Kong to America, are baffled. All are worried. \\n\\nHow did it come to this? For months negotiations proceeded \\nquietly as David Cameron, Britain’s prime minister, took his con- \\ncerns to other eu leaders and Eurocrats in Brussels oversaw tech- \\nnical talks. British diplomacy was conducted “very skilfully”, \\nsays one. Even the French were starting to believe that Britain was \\nseeking not to wreck the project, but to secure its place within it. \\n\\nHopes were high that a deal could be struck at an eu summit \\nlater this month. But soon after Mr Cameron detailed his propos- \\nals in a letter to Donald Tusk, the president of the European Coun- \\ncil, the wheels came off. Having previously hinted that he was \\nopen to discussion on his fourth “basket” of reforms, on migra- \\ntion, Mr Cameron suddenly reverted to an old demand. The eu \\ntreaties must be changed, he insisted, to allow Britain to impose a \\nfour-year delay before paying in-work benefits to migrant work- \\ners. The gambit flopped. On December 3rd Angela Merkel, Ger- \\nmany’s chancellor, told Mr Cameron that he could not expect rap- \\nid acquiescence to such a contentious request.

Worse, he has picked a \\nfight that may prove unwinnable. Every other government op- \\nposes changes that would violate the cherished principle of non- \\ndiscrimination. Brussels’s finest legal minds will spend the next  \\ntwo months trying to square the circle.

He wanted the eu \\nto become more competitive and pursue \\nmore trade deals. He sought a bigger role \\nfor national parliaments and a recognition \\nthat Britain was not bound by the goal of \\n“ever closer union”. He demanded guaran- \\ntees that euro-zone members would not \\ndiscriminate against non-members. And \\nhe called for an end to “benefits tourism” \\nby stopping eu migrants claiming in-work \\ntax credits and housing benefits until they \\nhad been in Britain for four years. \\n\\nMost of these reforms were doable, \\neven if some governments sucked their \\nteeth for form’s sake. Mr Cameron did his \\nbit by not insisting on a new treaty: he \\nmerely wanted his changes to be “legally  \\nbinding and irreversible”. As one French \\nofficial puts it, clarifications of the treaties \\nare fine, but changes are not. \\n\\nThe exception to the harmony was the \\nbenefits change, which other governments \\ndeclared illegal under eu laws on non-dis- \\ncrimination and free movement of labour. \\nEven here Mr Cameron offered flexibility: \\nif another solution could be found, he \\nwould consider it.

The House has already \\npassed something similar, and the presi- \\ndent is likely to sign a modified version. \\nThis new bill, too, has support from both \\nparties. But this time it stems from a shared \\nhatred of Mr Bush’s law. \\n\\nThe federal government’s role in run- \\nning America’s public schools has grown \\nfrom that of a glorified think-tank, charged \\nwith scouring for information to help  \\nstates build better school systems in the \\n19th century. When the second world war \\nput military installations, and the children \\nthat came with them, in states with thin \\ntax receipts, the federal government \\nstepped in to make up the shortfall. When \\nthe federal government moved to end ra- \\ncial segregation in schools in the 1960s, \\nWashington’s role in education increased \\nagain. The traffic has been one-way ever \\nsince, even though the federal government \\nprovides only 10% of overall school fund- \\ning. The new law, though, goes in the oppo- \\nsite direction. \\n\\nNo Child Left Behind obliged states to \\nset standards for proficiency in reading and \\nmaths, and held states and school districts  \\naccountable for meeting them. Pupils were \\ntested annually, with the goal of raising \\nstandards and closing gaps in achievement \\nbetween those from rich and those from \\npoor families. For a while pupils, especial- \\nly those from ethnic minorities, performed \\nsignificantly better. The gap between black \\nand white children narrowed.

Chicago- \\nans are outraged by a pattern of police mis- \\nconduct that seems to get worse every day. \\nCity officials led by Rahm Emanuel, the \\nmayor, are doing their utmost to contain a \\nscandal whose scale they have underesti- \\nmated. The Department of Justice has an- \\nnounced it will investigate the city’s cops. \\n\\nThe protagonists of the film are feuding \\nmembers of rival black gangs on the South \\nSide, idiotic policemen, racist military men \\nand a moronic mayor with a short temper. \\nAll this will make uncomfortable viewing \\nfor Chicago’s leaders as they grapple with \\nthe fallout from the release of a non-fiction \\nvideo showing the execution-style shoot- \\ning of a black teenager by a white police of- \\nficer. Mr Lee waded into the upheaval by \\npredicting that “some more heads are \\ngonna roll” after Mr Emanuel fired his \\nchief of police on December 1st. He was \\nright: on December 6th Mr Emanuel \\nsacked the head of the Independent Police \\nReview Authority, which had declared fa- \\ntal police shootings “justified” in all but \\none of the 400 cases it had investigated \\nsince 2007. The next day the head of Chica- \\ngo’s police detectives retired. \\n\\nSome folks in Englewood and other \\nparts of the city suffering gang-violence are \\nrefusing to see the film. They think Mr Lee \\nis making money from their misery and \\ndon’t recognise their grief, they say, in \\nbawdy musical comedy. Others worry that  \\nthe film-called “Chi-Raq” because, accord- \\ning to the film, more Americans died in \\nChicago from 2001 to 2015 (7,356) than in \\nthe Iraq war (4,424)-shows their city in too \\nviolent a light. It will deter tourists from \\nvisiting and business from investing, they \\nsay, though neither tourists nor investors \\nspend much time on the South Side, where \\nmost of the killing occurs. \\n\\nIn fact “Chi-Raq” is a contemporary \\ntake on “Lysistrata”, a comedy by Aristoph- \\nanes first performed in 411BC, in which Ly- \\nsistrata leads the women of Greece to with- \\nhold sex from their men to bring an end to \\nthe Peloponnesian war. Mr Lee takes the \\nstory into Chicago gangland, where Spar- \\ntans, clad in purple and led by a rapper \\ncalled Chi-Raq (Nick Cannon), are at war \\nwith Trojans, wearing orange and led by \\nWesley Snipes, with a diamond-encrusted \\npatch over one eye. The war escalates with \\na shoot-out in a nightclub where Chi-Raq \\nperforms and an arson attack on the house \\nwhere he sleeps with his girl, Lysistrata. \\n\\nThe turning point of the film is the mur- \\nder in broad daylight of Patti, anil-year-old \\ngirl.

But it \\nbrings a solution closer  \\nAS THE final results of the parliamentary \\n^Velection on December 6th came in- \\ntwo days after the vote-Venezuela’s presi- \\ndent, Nicolas Maduro, was at an army bar- \\nracks in Caracas preparing for his weekly \\ntelevision show, “In Contact with Madu- \\nro”. Venezuela’s presidents have been \\nmaking hours-long broadcasts since the \\nlate Hugo Chavez, his charismatic prede- \\ncessor, took power in 1999. Mr Maduro’s \\nappearance from the Montana barracks, a \\nfortified mock castle where Chavez’s body \\nnow lies, was the first to follow an election \\ndefeat. \\n\\nIt was a crushing one. Venezuelans vot- \\ned furiously against the left-wing regime \\nand for an opposition coalition, the Demo- \\ncratic Unity alliance (mud), that is deter- \\nmined to bring its increasingly authoritar- \\nian and incompetent rule to an end. Nearly \\nthree-quarters of the electorate turned out, \\nsome despite fears that their ballots would \\nnot be secret. The mud won the popular \\nvote by a margin of 15 percentage points. It \\ncaptured just over two-thirds of the seats in \\nthe National Assembly, which gives it \\nbroad powers to challenge the govern- \\nment. Even the district of 23 de Enero, the \\nbastion of chavismo where Mr Maduro \\nmade his broadcast, fell to the opposition. \\n\\nThe result is a clear rejection of the “Bo- \\nlivarian revolution” and its economically \\nilliterate ideology, “21st-century socialism”. \\nChavez won support from poor Venezue- \\nlans for more than a decade with price con-  \\ntrols and lavish social spending. Mr Madu- \\nro has neither his charisma nor his luck \\nwith oil prices. Basic goods are now in \\nshort supply, inflation is in triple digits and \\nthe economy is expected to contract by \\nabout 10% this year. \\n\\nYet the swing to the opposition does not \\ngive Venezuela an easy way out of its trou- \\nbles.

But the handoff from \\nCristina Fernandez de Kirchner, the outgo- \\ning president, to Mauricio Macri, the in- \\ncoming one, has been awkward even by \\nArgentine standards. Up to the eve of Mr \\nMacri’s inauguration on December 10th \\nthey squabbled about where it would take \\nplace. Mr Macri wanted the Casa Rosada \\n(the presidential palace), once the tradi- \\ntional venue. Ms Fernandez insisted on the \\nnational Congress building, where her al- \\nlies would be present. The departing presi- \\ndent is creating “as many roadblocks and \\nnew problems as she can”, complained Mr \\nMacri. “It’s not your birthday party,” retort- \\ned Ms Fernandez via Twitter. \\n\\nThe argument is about more serious \\nmatters than swearing-in ceremonies. Ms \\nFernandez’s last-minute decisions will \\nmake it harder for Mr Macri to resuscitate \\nArgentina’s ailing economy. Some will be \\neasier to reverse than others. On Novem- \\nber 30th Ms Fernandez signed a decree \\nboosting government spending by 133 bil- \\nlion pesos ($13.7 billion). On the same day \\nshe also named new ambassadors to sev- \\neral countries, including Cuba and Austra- \\nlia. That followed her nomination in Octo- \\nber of two Supreme Court judges. Mr \\nMacri should have little trouble halting the \\nnew appointments. Dealing with the new \\nspending promises will be trickier. \\n\\nMs Fernandez is bequeathing to her \\nsuccessor a fiscal deficit that is expected to \\nreach 7% of gdp this year, the biggest since \\n1982. Reducing that shortfall was never go- \\ning to be easy; her parting shots will make \\nit harder. They also threaten to distract the \\nnew government from its own agenda. \\nWith inflation close to 25% and foreign ex- \\nchange reserves at alarmingly low levels, \\nthere is little time to lose. Mr Macri “needs \\nto take decisions in the first days in office to \\nanchor expectations and restore investor \\nconfidence”, says Dante Sica of Abeceb, an \\neconomic consultancy. \\n\\nMr Macri has scored one victory in his \\ntussle with Ms Fernandez.

Both are \\nnationalist leaders of big Asian democra- \\ncies, with a dark side that often rankles: Mr \\nAbe has a tin ear when it comes to imperial \\nJapan’s wartime atrocities, while Mr Modi \\naverts his gaze from the Hindu bigotry of \\nsome of his devotees. Both want to assert \\nthe greatness of their countries by promot- \\ning growth-spurring reforms and closer \\nmilitary ties with the West. Both covet per- \\nmanent seats on the un Security Council. \\nAnd though China remains their biggest \\ntrading partner, both want to counter- \\nbalance its military rise. \\n\\nSo when Mr Abe comes to India for a \\nthree-day official visit beginning on De- \\ncember 11th, the question will be whether \\nthe two leaders can move from flirtation to \\ncommitment. The likeliest concrete out- \\ncome of the visit will be an agreement for \\nJapan to build a bullet-train line linking \\ntwo of India’s most dynamic cities, Mum- \\nbai and Ahmedabad, the commercial capi- \\ntal of Mr Modi’s home state of Gujarat. \\n\\nTwo other possible deals would be \\nmore significant, and therefore conten- \\ntious. One is an accord on civil-nuclear co-  \\noperation that would allow Japanese firms \\nto bid to build nuclear-power stations in \\nIndia. Japan regards itself as a champion of \\nnuclear non-proliferation, yet an accord \\nwould give a Japanese seal of approval to \\nIndia’s status as a nuclear-armed state. The \\nsecond deal is a plan for India to buy and \\nbuild Japanese seaplanes. It would \\namount to Japan’s first foreign sale of a mil- \\nitary platform; the ShinMaywa us-2 \\nplanes are used for surveillance as well as \\nsearch-and-rescue. \\n\\nMr Abe claims that the Indo-Japanese \\npartnership is the world’s “most important \\nbilateral relationship”. That sounds like \\nflattery. The most important relationship \\nfor both Japan and India is obviously with \\nAmerica-not least for countering China. \\nYet the Indo-Japanese romance is certainly \\nblossoming. This year Japan joined the an- \\nnual Malabar naval exercises with India \\nand America. Australia wants to join in, \\ntoo. An earlier attempt at such multilateral \\nwar-games in the Indian Ocean was aban- \\ndoned in 2008 after protests from China. \\n\\nThe resumption of such exercises be- \\ntrays regional nervousness about China, \\nparticularly over its building of bases on \\ncontested reefs in the South China Sea.

The Christian Council of \\nKorea, the country’s largest Protestant lob- \\nby, threatened to launch campaigns at elec- \\ntion time against legislators who sup- \\nported the bill. Clerical pressure has for \\ndecades stalled a vote on a tax. But on De- \\ncember 2nd mps agreed to impose one on \\nthe income of religious leaders from 2018. \\n\\nSouth Korea is the only advanced coun- \\ntry that exempts its clergy from all taxation. \\nStill, many Buddhist monks and Protestant \\npastors pay dues voluntarily on their per- \\nsonal incomes; all Catholic priests have \\ndone so since 1994. In September the Pres- \\nbyterians said that they would join them. \\nPriests who support the new tax say it is \\nonly fair: everyone is doing God’s work, \\nwhether reverend or farmer. But others \\nscorn the idea. They say taxes reduce the \\ngodly work of the clergy to mere labour. \\n\\nThe Church Finance Accountability \\nNetwork, a voluntary group which advises \\nchurches on managing their budgets, says \\nthat pastors should set an example. There \\nis a widespread belief that some churches \\nare averse to tax because they do not want \\ncloser scrutiny of the huge sums that cross \\ntheir collection plates. Last week the Na- \\ntional Tax Service said it had discovered 63 \\norganisations that had issued receipts for \\nfictitious donations (and had received kick-  \\n\\nbacks from the tax-dodgers). Almost all of \\nthem were religious groups. In a recent poll \\nof 1,000 South Koreans by the Christian \\nEthics Movement, a local reformist body, \\nonly two in ten thought Protestantism was \\ntrustworthy.

This has benefited the country, \\nas it has Asian neighbours such as In- \\ndonesia and the Philippines. Sri Lankan \\nmigrants sent home $7 billion in 2014, \\nequivalent to 9% of gdp; remittances to \\nthe Philippines now amount to around \\n$27 billion, much of it from domestic \\nworkers. For many women, scrubbing \\nforeign floors is a route out of poverty. \\n\\nYet dangers are rife, particularly in \\nSaudi Arabia, which hired nearly 40,000 \\nSri Lankan maids in 2014. In 2013 a Sri \\nLankan worker in Saudi Arabia was \\nconvicted of killing a baby and behead- \\ned; two Indonesian maids, also accused \\nof murder, were put to death this spring. \\nFar more common are abuses by employ- \\ners, including physical assaults and with- \\nholding of wages. \\n\\nThe failure of maid-hiring countries to \\ngive better protection to their paid guests  \\nhas been fuelling demands in the send- \\ning countries for curbs on such labour \\nflows. Since August Sri Lankan authori- \\nties have required would-be migrant \\nmaids to secure a certified “family back- \\nground report” proving that they have no \\nchildren under the age of five. In April the \\nIndonesian government said it would \\nsend no more female domestic workers \\nto 21 Middle-Eastern countries. It talks of \\neventually recalling all its maids from \\nemployment around the world. \\n\\nThe motives behind such bans are \\nsometimes suspect. Nationalists dislike \\nthe thought of compatriots skivvying for \\nforeigners; conservatives would rather \\nwomen did not work at all. Nor are bans \\nlikely to help migrant workers, who \\ngenerally choose to become maids \\nabroad because they have no better \\noption at home. In 2012 Nepal briefly \\nbanned women under the age of 30 from \\naccepting domestic work in Arab states. \\nResearch by the International Labour \\nOrganisation suggests that the law did \\nnot dissuade many from going, but did \\nmake them much more vulnerable to \\npeople-traffickers. \\n\\nMeanwhile, hardly any government \\nkeeps a close eye on its citizens working \\nas servants abroad.

       "  'The decline of a famous American \\nbeauty company \\n\\n^TRAVELLING salesman founded Avon \\n-/ldni886, recruiting women to hawk per- \\nfumes while their husbands were at \\nwork-a chance for them to earn an inde- \\npendent living at a time when such oppor- \\ntunities were rare. By 1920 Avon had more \\nthan $im in annual sales. By the early 1970s \\nthe company’s advertising campaigns had \\nmade the cheerful, confident “Avon lady” \\nan instantly recognisable figure, and its \\nsales had reached $1 billion. Today the \\ncompany boasts that its brand “stands for \\nbeauty, innovation, optimism, and above \\nall for women.” \\n\\nTo many investors, however, Avon now \\nstands for incompetence. Its share price \\nhas plunged by nearly 60% so far this year. \\nQuarterly earnings calls, usually polite af- \\nfairs, have become decidedly less so, as \\nstock analysts press executives to explain \\nanother set of dismal results. This month \\nthere have been reports that Avon may sell \\nits floundering North American business \\nto Cerberus, a private-equity firm. Activist \\ninvestors, including Barington Capital \\nGroup and NuOrion Partners, are wary of \\nsuch proposals. Instead they want Avon to \\nsack its chief executive and replace some \\nboard members, cut costs and shake up its \\ndistribution system.  \\nAvon is keeping mum on the reports \\nabout selling to Cerberus. In response to \\nthe activists, who together have a stake of \\nmore than 3%, Avon gave a predictably \\nbland response about “continuing our dia- \\nlogue with our shareholders”. Privately, \\nthe company is sure to be less sanguine. \\n\\nAvon is still sizeable, with nearly $9 bil- \\nlion in revenue last year. It has 6m indepen- \\ndent saleswomen (and a few salesmen) \\nwho buy Avon products at a discount, then \\npeddle those goods to customers. Avon \\nnow operates in 60 countries, with Latin \\nAmerica as its biggest market. In develop- \\ning economies, where conventional retail- \\ning remains underdeveloped, door-to- \\ndoor selling can be a good way to reach \\nconsumers who are beginning to enjoy \\nsome disposable income. \\n\\nDespite this global reach, Avon looks \\nincreasingly wan. Its operating margin is \\nless than half what it was a decade ago. It \\nfaces growing competition from other re- \\ntailers of beauty products, both bricks-and- \\nmortar and online. Avon’s woes cannot be \\nblamed on the direct-sales model: other \\nfirms are doing just fine with it. Barington \\nblames “chronic mismanagement” and a \\n“lack of effective board oversight”. \\n\\nIts most disastrous move, in hindsight, \\nwas to reject a $10 billion takeover bid in \\n2012 from Coty, another beauty company. \\nWhen Avon’s board rebuffed the offer, it \\nargued that a new chief executive would \\nbe a “greater opportunity to improve \\nshareholder value”. However under the \\nnew boss, Sheri McCoy, Avon’s share price \\nhas crumpled, and the company is now \\nworth less than $2 billion. \\n\\nIn America Avon has struggled to retain \\nits freelance sales reps and has done little \\nto market its products in other ways, such \\nas on'],\n",

       "  'A split of the digital currency now \\nseems unlikely, but problems remain \\n\\nUTT ’S time for a group hug,” one of the \\n1 participants joked at the end. After a \\nlong and lively exchange, programmers, \\nwho write the software behind bitcoin, \\nand “miners”, whose computers mint the \\ndigital currency, had indeed found some \\ncommon ground. But the rapport between \\nthe two camps still seemed tentative. At \\none point a developer asked whether min- \\ners, who now mostly hail from China, \\nwould ever collude to steal bitcoin. \\n\\nSuspicions between developers and \\nminers were not the only ones on display \\nat “Scaling Bitcoin”, a conference in Hong \\nKong this week. Developers themselves \\nhave been feuding, too. The event was in- \\ntended to end a dispute about how to ex- \\npand the capacity of the bitcoin system. \\nCurrently, it can only handle seven transac- \\ntions per second-a fraction of what con- \\nventional payment systems can manage. \\nThe number could be increased by allow- \\ning bigger “blocks”-the name given to the \\nbatches into which bitcoin transactions are \\nassembled before they are processed. \\n\\nFor years developers have disagreed \\nabout how much, if at all, blocks should \\ngrow. Fearing that the system would soon \\nhit its limits, two of them, Gavin Andresen \\nand Mike Hearn, lost patience this sum- \\nmer: they called on miners to install a new \\nversion of bitcoin’s software which works \\nwith much bigger blocks. The result was a \\nrift between developers and a spasm in bit- \\ncoin’s yo-yoing value (see chart). \\n\\nHighly technical talks, lengthy debates \\nand much socialising allowed the more \\nthan 200 participants at the conference to \\nair their grievances and discuss all sorts of \\nways to allow bitcoin to grow. It helped \\nthat the two renegades did not attend (Mr \\nAndresen is now a researcher at mit’s Me- \\ndia Lab and Mr Hearn has joined R3 cev, a \\ncoalition of banks developing bitcoin-like \\ntechnology). Bitcoin xt, as the controver- \\nsial new software is called, has not been \\nwidely adopted. \\n\\nAlthough details still need to be worked \\nout, it now looks likely that developers will \\nfirst-perhaps within a few months-im- \\nplement technical fixes to boost bitcoin’s \\ncapacity without increasing the maximum \\nblock size. A small increase in the block \\nsize-probably from one to as many as four \\nmegabytes-is expected to come only later; \\nit is considered a risky move that requires \\nall computers on the bitcoin network to in- \\nstall new software at the same time. \\n\\nThat still leaves open the question of  \\n\\nhow such decisions should be made in fu- \\nture. Civil wars and subsequent peace con- \\nferences are an inefficient way to create \\nconsensus. As befits advocates of a curren- \\ncy without a central bank, neither develop- \\ners nor miners want to be at the helm (in \\npractice they share authority, since the sys- \\ntem could not work without both groups). \\nSome at the conference argued that, like \\nthe internet, bitcoin needs a formal gover- \\nnance structure.

In 1970 \\nemployment in manufacturing in Ameri- \\nca, much of it in the Midwest, accounted \\nfor about a third of the labour force.

His \\nsuggestions are not new, but almost a re- \\nturn to fundamentals: they have to use \\ntheir geographical advantages (meaning, \\nthese days, tourism and logistics rather \\nthan geology) and build as much as possi- \\nble on “anchor” institutions such as uni- \\nversities and hospitals. What they must \\nnot do is distract themselves by construct-   ing an enormous stadium or a theme park \\nthat may turn into a white elephant. It is a \\nvery rare city that has helped itself by host- \\ning international sports. \\n\\nA good example of Mr Katz’s first pre- \\ncept, making full use of geographical as- \\nsets, can be found in Galena, Illinois. Gale- \\nna is a smallish city that lies the whole \\nbreadth of Illinois away from Gary, on the \\nMississippi that marks the Iowa border.

It has \\nlong been out of print, but it described the \\nNew York Police Department (nypd) for lit- \\ntle folks, and the commissioner (who is on \\nhis second stint in the job, after a highly \\nsuccessful first in the 1990s) still carries it \\nround like a talisman. The last paragraph \\nof the book begins: “We must always re- \\nmember that whenever you see a police- \\nman, he is your friend.” For many New \\nYorkers, particularly minorities, that is the \\nlast thing they think. \\n\\nMost New Yorkers feel safe in the city: \\nlast year the murder rate was the lowest \\nsince before John Kennedy was president. \\nBut only half think the police are doing a \\ngood job. According to the nypd’s own re- \\nsearch, whiter, wealthier neighbourhoods \\nhave more positive opinions of the police, \\nand blacks and Latinos have poorer ones. \\nThe lowest approval ratings are in the areas \\nwith the most violent crime. This is not \\nrocket science, but at least it is spurring Mr \\nBratton and his boss Bill de Blasio, New \\nYork’s mayor, to try to change perceptions \\nof the force. \\n\\nMorale is also low on the police side. \\nRelations between the mayor and rank- \\nand-file officers have been fraught for near- \\nly a year. Last summer Eric Garner, an un- \\narmed African-American, died at the \\nhands of a white policeman. Thousands of \\nNew Yorkers took to the streets to protest \\nabout a grand jury’s decision in December \\nnot to indict the officer who caused Mr \\nGarner’s death, and a deranged man shot \\ntwo cops dead in apparent revenge as they \\nsat in their patrol car eating lunch. \\n\\nThe police say they feel unsupported by \\nCity Hall. In an internal police-department \\nsurvey in 2014, around 70% said that fear of \\nbeing sued kept them from making lawful \\ninterventions against criminal activity on \\nthe streets. Many of the 35,000-strong force  feel ill-prepared and undervalued. \\n\\nSo on June 25th the mayor and the com- \\nmissioner unveiled their neighbourhood \\npolicing plan: “One City: Safe and Fair- \\nEvery where”. It has five elements, “the five \\nTs”, which sounds more like a Motown \\ngroup than a police plan: tactics, technol- \\nogy, training, terrorism and trust. The idea \\nis to keep crime low, continue to deter ter- \\nrorists and, meanwhile, improve relations \\nbetween police and New Yorkers. Other \\ncities, such as long-struggling Camden, \\nNew Jersey, have embraced the same ideal \\nof community policing and have seen im- \\npressive drops in crime. New York tried a \\nversion of it for a spell in the early 1990s, \\nbut ultimately abandoned it. \\n\\nThis time round, the idea is for officers \\nto spend more time getting to know the \\npeople who live and work in the areas they \\nserve. Some cops will be exempt from re- \\nsponding to 911 calls so that they can con- \\ncentrate on building trust. Others will be \\nmoved out of deskj obs.

Not only were they hawking \\nwithout a $150 “peddler’s permit”, but \\nalso the state requires a formal kitchen \\ninspection and a permit to sell anything \\nthat might spoil if stored at the wrong \\ntemperature. As authorities are meant “to \\nact to prevent an immediate and serious \\nthreat to human life or health”, the offi- \\ncers understandably moved swiftly in. \\n\\nAmericans increasingly like to buy \\nlocal food.

But regulating the sale of goods \\nmade in ordinary kitchens is a “grey \\narea”, says Emily Broad Leib of the Har- \\nvard Law School Food Law and Policy \\nClinic. So states are passing “cottage-food \\nlaws” allowing people to sell “non-pot- \\nentially hazardous” foods, such as baked \\ngoods and almost anything canned, from \\ntheir homes. But the rules are often odd \\nor fussy, and no two states are alike. \\n\\nRhode Island, for example, allows \\nfarmers to peddle their wares but bans \\neveryone else. In Oklahoma the law \\napplies only to bakers, who may sell up \\nto $20,ooo-worth of breads and cakes as \\nlong as the sales take place in their  homes, not a market. In Wisconsin resi- \\ndents may sell only homemade canned \\ngoods, not baked ones, and sales must be \\ncapped at $5,000 a year. A lawsuit against \\na similar limit in Minnesota was dropped \\non June 16 th after state lawmakers voted \\nto raise the annual cap to $18,000 for \\nsellers who register with the state and \\ntake a safety course. Some states explicit- \\nly ban internet sales, as products sold \\nacross state lines are subject to more \\nstringent federal food laws. \\n\\nResistance to loosening the rules \\nlargely comes from health officials, who \\nworry about the risks of unlicensed \\nkitchens.

He proved that by being the only \\nMexican journalist to accompany Fidel \\nCastro to Havana in 1959, the year of \\nCuba’s revolution.

Anjar’s hot and \\nhumid climate is ideal for cotton spinning. \\nThe thread would break too frequently in a  place with drier air. \\n\\nIn the weaving shed next door, the \\nback-and-forth of the looms, like an end- \\nless train passing over rail sleepers, is deaf- \\nening. The air-jet looms at Anjar run at \\naround six times the speed of an old-fash- \\nioned shuttle loom. There is a drawback to \\nsuch productivity. Fabric woven at high \\nspeed can look flat and rag-like in contrast \\nto the bouncier cloth produced on shuttle \\nlooms. To give it a lift, the finished cloth is \\nfed through a giant tumble dryer at 130X. \\nBut first the cloth is dyed. The plant rolls \\nout 5-6 tonnes of newly dyed cloth every \\ntwo hours before the colour is changed. \\nEach shade is a mix of two or three dyes \\nfrom a palette of 80. \\n\\nOnce the dyed and dried cloth is ready, \\nthe tasks at the factory make greater use of \\nmanpower. The cloth is cut into panels and \\nthe hems sewn by hand. Labels are \\nstitched into the hems by seamstresses. \\nThe towels are folded by teams of workers, \\nwho watch for defects. The packaged \\ntowels are fork-lifted into 40-foot contain- \\ners, which are sealed in front of two excise \\nofficers and cctv cameras. \\n\\nWelspun runs a fleet of 25 lorries \\nbetween its loading bay and the port at \\nMundra, 50km away.

That would suit Lee Jae- \\nyong, the only son of Samsung’s chairman, \\nLee Kun-hee. The elder Mr Lee has been in \\nhospital for over a year since a heart attack; \\nhis son is preparing to pay about $5 billion \\nin inheritance tax while keeping family \\ncontrol of the group, through small stakes \\nin a hairball of cross-shareholdings. The \\nmerger allows Mr Lee to consolidate that \\nstructure, and to gain more than $12 billion \\nin stakes in other Samsung companies, in- \\ncluding a further 4.1% stake in Samsung \\nElectronics, its flagship firm. \\n\\nNot so fast, said Elliott Management. \\nThe American hedge fund (widely known \\nas a “vulture” fund for its investments in \\ndistressed debt) boosted its c8?t stake after  the merger was announced, becoming its \\nthird-largest investor, and filed a lawsuit to \\nblock the deal. Elliott argues that the merg- \\ner is unfair for c8?t shareholders, who it \\nsays will lose $7 billion due to the huge dis- \\nparity in the two firms’ valuations: when \\nthe merger was announced, Cheil’s stock \\nwas trading at over 130 times forecast earn- \\nings, whereas c8?t’s ratio had slipped to \\naround 20. (Firms in South Korea’s kospi \\nindex on average have a forward price- \\nearnings ratio of ah out 11.) \\n\\nA court in Seoul has rejected two in- \\njunctions filed by Elliott to try to halt the \\ndeal; it ruled that the ratio by which shares \\nin c&T will be swapped for Cheil shares \\ndid not indicate any price manipulation. \\nSouth Korean law says that the ratio must \\nbe based on average stock prices over the \\nprevious month, a formula that Samsung \\nused. Samsung contends that the deal will \\n“ultimately increase shareholder value” by \\nfusing the global network of its construc- \\ntion arm with Cheil’s food and fashion \\nbusinesses, though it is vague on how \\nbringing together outfits from such differ- \\nent industries will save much money. \\n\\nThe conflict will come to a head on July \\n17th, when c8?t’s shareholders vote on the \\ndeal.

       "  'Banks once dreaded rate rises. Are they \\nright to look forward to them now? \\n\\nT extbooks say that banks make mon- \\ney by raising deposits relatively cheap- \\nly from savers and lending them, at a high- \\ner rate, to borrowers. The difference \\nbetween the two rates is known in the \\ntrade as the “net interest margin” (nim), \\nand its size is an important factor in banks’ \\nprofits. But as the financial crisis prompted \\ncentral banks around the world to lower \\ninterest rates almost to zero (and below, in \\na few cases), banks have been in a quanda- \\nry. They cannot lower deposit rates enough \\nto be able to lend at a decent margin, since \\nmost assume that depositors will not toler- \\nate negative rates. Instead, they have \\nwatched the nim shrink (see chart on next \\npage), and tried to recoup some of the lost \\nprofits by raising fees. \\n\\nAmerica’s 5,600 banks have therefore \\neagerly been awaiting the turn in the inter- \\nest-rate cycle, in the hope that higher rates \\nwill bring a wider nim and thus fatter pro- \\nfits. Since January 28th, when Janet Yellen, \\nthe chairman of the Federal Reserve, sug- \\ngested the first increase was not too far off, \\nbank shares have risen by 11%, much more \\nthan the market as a whole. In a presenta- \\ntion in February, JPMorgan Chase, Ameri- \\nca’s biggest bank by assets, noted that in \\n2005-10, its net interest margin averaged \\n2.95%; last year, it was just 2.18%. Raising it \\nby half a percentage point, the bank said, \\nwould increase earnings by $10 billion. \\n\\nBy the same token, hsbc, a multina- \\ntional bank which has a relatively small re- \\ntail operation in America, predicted that an \\nincrease of a percentage point in the cur-   '],\n",

It \\nused to be, as in most industries, that when \\nthe price of their main input-money- \\nwent up, profits fell. A paper* published in \\n2014 by three economists at the Federal Re- \\nserve Board explains why. Short-term rates \\nare usually lower than long-term ones. \\nSince most deposits are short-term, but \\nmany of the loans banks make, in the form \\nof things like mortgages, are long-term, the \\ngap between short and long rates helps to \\npad the nim. But as long-term rates rise, so \\ndoes the discount rate that must be applied \\nto future earnings, depressing the value of \\nlong-term assets more than short-term li- \\nabilities. Moreover, higher rates crimp eco- \\nnomic growth, curbing demand for loans \\nand raising the number of defaults. \\n\\nWhy have banks’ share prices risen, in \\nthat case? In theory, banks have learned to \\ninsulate themselves from the adverse ef- \\nfects of rising rates. Relatively few banks \\nstill follow the textbook model, simply tak- \\ning in deposits and dispensing long-term \\ncredit, notes Frederick Cannon of kbw, an \\ninvestment bank. Instead, they often sell \\noff the loans they originate or use deriva- \\ntives to hedge against rate hikes. At the \\nsame time, many are raising more funds \\nthrough certificates of deposits and or oth- \\ner fixed-rate, longer-term instruments. \\n\\nNonetheless, notes Mr Cannon, similar \\noptimism about the impact of the first rate \\nrise after a long period of rock-bottom rates \\nproved misplaced at Japanese banks in \\n2006. Loan demand remained sluggish, \\nmargins narrow and share prices listless. \\nEven if banks manage to avoid the write- \\ndowns on assets that have come with rate \\nrises in the past, they still face another pro- \\nblem: the possibility that the price of at- \\ntracting deposits rises more quickly than \\nthe interest they can charge on loans. \\n\\nDeposits are normally assumed to be \\n“sticky”, meaning that customers do not  T 'HE timing was poor.

The interrogation was \\naccompanied by stories and photos of sick  >» who could be left without affordable cover- \\nage should the high court toss the law. \\n\\nThe line of attack is not without footing. \\nIn 2017, Ms Barrett criticised NFIB v Sebe- \\nlius, the 2012 Supreme Court decision up- \\nholding the constitutionality of the law's \\nrequirement that most Americans buy \\nhealth insurance. When Chief Justice John \\nRoberts anchored a 5-4 majority interpret- \\ning the mandate as a tax within Congress’s \\nrevenue-raising power, she wrote, he \\n“pushed the Affordable Care Act beyond its \\nplausible meaning to save the statute”. Jux- \\ntaposing Chief Justice Roberts with \\n“staunch textualists” such as her mentor, \\nAntonin Scalia, Ms Barrett then used a foot- \\nnote to detail several other cases in which \\nthe chief “depart/ed] from ostensibly clear \\ntext” in order to achieve his “preferable re- \\nsult”.

Ms \\nBarrett insisted she had made Mr Trump no \\npromises and was “not hostile” to Obama- \\ncare. She also pointed out that the new \\nchallenge, California v Texas, involves a \\nquestion not at stake in the earlier cases: \\nwhether, if the now-toothless individual \\nmandate (which fined people who chose to \\ngo uninsured) is unconstitutional, that \\npulls the rug o\"],\n",

He called her a “tyrant” and \\npredicted fellow militiamen all over Amer- \\nica would rise and topple other leaders, \\nwhen “everybody takes their tyrants”.

The plot, he insist- \\ned, must precede the elections in Novem- \\nber. They would try her for “treason”, per- \\nhaps in Wisconsin, over her efforts to \\ncontain coronavirus.

       "  'AST OCTOBER, after an election marred \\n\\nby accusations of fraud, Joan Fernandez \\njoined thousands of Bolivians in protests \\nthat toppled the socialist government of \\nEvo Morales. His joy quickly gave way to \\ndisillusion. After Mr Morales, who had \\nbeen seeking a fourth term, resigned on \\nNovember 1oth and fled to Mexico, Jeanine \\nAfiez, a right-wing senator, became presi- \\ndent. Her only goal, she said, was to pre- \\npare fresh elections. Instead, she became a \\ncandidate, used the justice system to go \\nafter her rivals and flubbed the govern- \\nment’s response to the pandemic. \\n\\n“They used us to get rid of Evo and then \\nthey abandoned us,” says Mr Fernandez, a \\ncollege student from Villa Armonia (Har- \\nmony Town), a working-class neighbour- \\nhood in La Paz, the administrative capital. \\nWith new elections scheduled for October \\n18th, the plaza is decorated with flags from \\nrival political parties, a loudspeaker an- \\nnounces free rabies jabs and families chat \\nas they wait with dogs on leads and cats in \\nblankets. The harmonious scene is decep-  tive. People are stocking up on food in an- \\nticipation of post-election protests, says \\nMr Fernandez, stroking his cocker spaniel. \\n\\nBolivia is again bitterly divided between \\nsupporters of Mr Morales’s Movement to \\nSocialism (MAS) and backers of Carlos \\nMesa, a centrist former president who ran \\nlast year. Polls predict a runoff, which \\nwould be held on November 29th. Mr Mesa \\nwould probably win that. But the MAS can- \\ndidate, Luis Arce, an ex-finance minister, \\ncould win in the first round. Either result \\nwould give Bolivia a chance to lessen the \\nrancour left by Mr Morales’s 14-year rule \\nand Ms Afiez’s interregnum. “The only \\nthing I want is stability,” says Mr Fernan- \\ndez, who is betting on Mr Arce to deliver it. \\nBut the gulfis wide. An economic crisis will \\nmake it harder to narrow. \\n\\nIn 2016 Bolivians voted ina referendum \\nto deny Mr Morales, the first indigenous \\npresident, the right to run again. He ig- \\nnored them. On election night last October \\na pause in the rapid count fuelled suspi- \\ncions of vote-rigging. An audit by the Orga-  nisation of American States (OAS) appeared \\nto confirm an attempt to manipulate the \\nresults. Anger surged, and Mr Morales quit. \\n\\nHis backers say he was the victim of a \\nright-wing coup. Several studies, including \\none by the Centre for Economic and Policy \\nResearch, a left-wing think-tank in Wash- \\nington, Dc, have questioned the OAs’s find- \\nings. “The oAs should leave our democracy \\nalone,’ says Mr Arce. Most of the 36 people \\nkilled in protests after the elections were \\nMAS supporters who died at the hands of \\nthe police or the army. \\n\\nMs Afiez did not bring harmony.

He says it started as a modest \\nchallenge to himself: “I wanted to do some- \\nthing nice for her at least once a week.” To \\nhis surprise, he found that he enjoyed it. \\nThese days the couple share child care and \\nhousework more or less equally, helped \\nalong by his flexible hours as a civil servant \\nand her control over her schedule running \\na private art school. They hope that their \\nson, now seven, will grow up without old- \\nfashioned preconceptions about men’s \\nand women’s work. “I truly believe those \\nstereotypes will disappear in the next gen- \\neration,’ says Mr Shin. \\n\\nThat may be optimistic, but the family’s \\nset-up, although still unusual for South Ko- \\nrea, is less exotic than it would have been \\njust a few years ago, thanks in part to a gra- \\ndual shift in the authorities’ response to \\nthe country’s demographic decline. For de- \\ncades South Korean women have had too \\nfew children to keep the population steady \\nin the long run. Last year deaths exceeded \\nbirths for the first time. A series of cam-  paigns and incentives to encourage wom- \\nen to have more children have not worked. \\nSo the authorities have begun to focus \\non stopping the shrinking of the work- \\nforce, aS opposed to the population. Mak- \\ning big changes to the retirement age or ad- \\nmitting lots of immigrants would be tricky \\npolitically, so officials are instead making \\nit easier for women to join and remain in \\nthe labour market, where they are under- \\nrepresented. The resulting developments \\nare a far cry from an egalitarian revolution, \\nbut both the work culture and relations be- \\ntween the sexes are beginning to change. \\nSejong, where Mr Shin lives with his \\nfamily, is a good place to observe the im- \\npact of those changes on families. It is a  newly built administrative city south of \\nSeoul, the capital, and it will probably \\nstruggle to achieve the government's popu- \\nlation target of half a million inhabitants \\nby the middle of the decade. But it is popu- \\nlar with young families and couples plan- \\nning to start one. At 37 the average Sejongite \\nis nearly six years younger than the average \\nKorean. Children make up nearly a quarter \\nof the population, compared with 15% on \\nthe national level. The city consistently re- \\ncords the highest fertility rate in the coun- \\ntry. Last year the average woman in Sejong \\ncould expect to have 1.5 children over her \\nlifetime, fully double the rate in Seoul, \\nthough still below the average for rich \\ncountries (see chart on next page). \\n\\nSejong is indeed child-friendly.

Its colours—black, red and yellow— \\nrepresent Australia’s first people, their \\nconnection to the land and the life-giving \\nsun. It is hoisted over schools and waved at \\nsporting fixtures. It flies periodically over \\nSydney's famous Harbour Bridge. Yet Ab- \\noriginals fear its very existence is under \\nthreat. \\n\\nThe issue is copyright. Australia’s gov- \\nernment has officially adopted the flag, but \\nits design is still owned by the man who \\ncreated it, Harold Thomas, an Aboriginal \\nartist. He conceived it in the 1970s as a ban- \\nner for the campaign to allow Aboriginals \\nto reclaim their traditional lands. The im- \\nage was reproduced fairly freely until 2018, \\nwhen he sold exclusive rights to its use on \\napparel and “digital and physical media \\nproducts” to WAM Clothing, a private firm. \\n\\nWAM has since chased down many firms \\nand charities for royalties. The Victorian \\nAboriginal Health Service was told it would \\nhave to pay to use the flag on T-shirts, a re-  cent Senate inquiry heard. These were sold \\nat cost to patients to encourage them to at- \\ntend check-ups. Diabetes Victoria, another \\nnon-profit, had to stop using the flag on its \\nwebsite because WAM demanded payment. \\n\\n“How could one company have a mono- \\npoly on an iconic symbol?” wonders Laura \\nThompson, an indigenous health expert. \\nShe started a campaign to “free the flag” \\nafter her charitable enterprise was given \\nthree days to “cease and desist” from print- \\ning iton clothing. To some, it seems doubly \\ninsulting that the firm commercialising \\nthe banner is owned by white Australians. \\nWorse, critics argue, its co-founder, Ben \\nWooster, has a record of exploiting indige- \\nnous culture. Another of his companies, \\nBirubi Art, was fined A$2.3m ($1.65m) last \\nyear for selling fake Aboriginal art. \\n\\nThe danger, says Linda Burney, the \\ncountry’s first indigenous Mp, is that the \\nemblem could be forced out of use. It is al- \\nready disappearing from sport. The Austra- \\nlian Football League (AFL), of top Aussie- \\nrules teams, normally prints the flag on \\npitches and players’ jerseys for an annual \\n“indigenous round”, which celebrates its \\nAboriginal athletes. It stopped doing so \\nthis year after WAM threatened legal action. \\nAustralia’s national cricket and rugby un- \\nion teams and the National Rugby League \\nhave all followed, saying they will not pay. \\n\\nThe national government is trying to \\ndefuse the row by buying the rights from \\nMr Thomas, WAM Clothing and two other \\nlicensees. This should allow the flag to be \\nused freely. But not everyone likes the idea \\nof handing custodianship of the image to \\nbureaucrats. The Senate inquiry recom- \\nmended that an independent Aboriginal \\ncommittee should be in charge of it.

       "  'OST BANKERS have been working fran- \\n\\ntically for the past six months. Trad- \\ners handled record-high volumes in chop- \\npy markets. Their colleagues issued \\nmountains of equity and debt as compa- \\nnies sought to withstand the economic \\ndownturn by amassing capital. Commer- \\ncial bankers offered forbearance to strug- \\ngling borrowers, and were forced to write \\ndown the value of loans as the likelihood of \\nbeing repaid fell. As a result, investment- \\nbanking revenues soared in the first half of \\nthe year, and most commercial banks suf- \\nfered losses as they set aside provisions for \\nbad loans. That made for slender profits at \\nBank of America, Citigroup and JPMorgan \\nChase, the big hybrid banks. Goldman \\nSachs and Morgan Stanley, which are more \\nskewed towards investment banking, post- \\ned stellar profits. Wells Fargo, a mostly \\ncommercial lender, lost money. \\n\\nThe third-quarter earnings reported by \\nfive of these banks on October 13th and 14th \\ntell a different story (the sixth, Morgan \\nStanley, was due to report on the 15th, as \\nThe Economist went to press). Investment \\nbankers were still busy—trading revenues  were up by around 20% compared with the \\nthird quarter of 2019, and Goldman’s pro- \\nfits doubled on the year. But the pace of ac- \\ntivity was leisurely compared with the sec- \\nond quarter, when trading revenues were \\nup by 60% over the same period in 2019. \\nBanks also think they are now largely \\nprepared for losses. In the first half of the \\nyear the big five booked $6o0bn-worth of  provisions for bad loans. But those in the \\nthird quarter were skinnier, at just $6.5bn, \\nnot far off those in the third quarter of 2019 \\n(see chart). The stock of allowances for bad \\nloans adds up to $106bn, about 2.8% of \\nbanks’ loan books. Non-performing assets \\nare creeping up, but are still far from the \\nlevels that would wipe out provisions. Jen- \\nnifer Piepszak, the chief financial officer of \\nJPMorgan, said that customers were “hold- \\ning up well”. \\n\\nAs the perils of higher provisions and \\nthe spoils from market volatility became \\nless dramatic, investors’ attention turned \\ntowards a more prosaic influence on earn- \\nings: banks’ net interest incomes, or the \\ndifference between the interest collected \\non loans and other assets and the interest \\npaid on deposits and other funding. These \\nhave been squeezed by interest-rate cuts by \\nthe Federal Reserve and low long-term \\nbond yields. America’s five large banks \\nearned $44bn in net interest income in the \\nthird quarter, 13% less than in the same per- \\niod last year. All together, reduced interest \\nincome, calmer trading revenues and sub- \\nsiding credit costs meant that profits were \\nlower than they were a year ago, but less \\nstarkly so than in the second quarter. Pro- \\nfits fell by 1% across Bank of America, Citi- \\ngroup and JPMorgan in the third quarter, \\ncompared witha drop of 56% in the second. \\n\\nThe question now is what banks will do \\nwith their earnings.

She produced \\nplays for children that questioned gender \\nstereotypes, ran a sex-education blog and \\ncelebrated same-sex relationships on so- \\ncial media (incurring a fine for disseminat- \\ning gay “propaganda’). She also shared sty- \\nlised drawings of female nudes in an \\nonline group named after the play “The Va- \\ngina Monologues’. \\n\\nAmong her sketches was a series called \\n“A Woman is Not a Doll”. In one image, a \\nwoman sits with her legs apart, accompa- \\nnied by the slogan, “Living women have \\nbody hair’. In another (see picture), a \\nShapely figure in bikini bottoms and a sun \\nhat perches among the words, “Living \\nwomen have fat—and that’s normal!” \\n\\nSupposedly on account of these and \\nother pictures, police raided Ms Tsvet- \\nkova’s home last year and arrested her on \\ncharges of “distributing pornography”. \\nWhen her case comes to trial (no date has \\nyet been set), she faces up to Six years in \\nprison.

He is due to refinance \\nsome of this, but nobody knows how.

In case Punjabis were in doubt \\nthat they were being punished for rejecting \\nthe farming reforms, the centre announced  it would no longer give the state an annual \\n$135m earmarked for rural development. \\n\\nIn theory, responsibilities are neatly di- \\nvided between the different levels of gov- \\nernment, but in practice there are inevita- \\nble, contentious overlaps. Farming is \\nostensibly a state subject, for example, but \\nin practice Punjab in particular has profit- \\ned mightily from the centre’s investmentin \\nirrigation and subsidies for grain. Hence its \\nfarmers are less keen on reforms than oth- \\ners across India, a resentment Congress is \\nhappy to stoke. \\n\\nWhen provoked by states in earlier de- \\ncades, the centre frequently responded by \\ninvoking a constitutional clause that al- \\nlows it to declare a state government un- \\nable to function properly, and so to disband \\nit and impose direct rule from the centre \\ntemporarily. That sort of disruption, typi- \\ncally made following an indecisive elec- \\ntion or internal unrest, has grown rarer \\nwith time. But with covid-19 deepening an \\neconomic slump, frictions have inevitably \\ngrown.

But in one way he has al- \\nready distinguished himself: during his \\nfirst speech to the Diet as prime minister, \\non October 26th, he promised to reduce Ja- \\npan’s net emissions of greenhouse gases to \\nzero by 2050, breaking with Mr Abe's foot- \\ndragging on climate change. That brings Ja- \\npan, the world’s third-biggest economy \\nand fifth-biggest emitter, with a relatively \\npoor record On emissions cuts (see chart), \\nin line with Britain and the European Un- \\nion and slightly ahead of China, which last \\nmonth promised zero emissions by 2060. \\n\\nJapan had previously pledged to be car- \\nbon neutral by an unspecified date in the \\nsecond half of the century. That woolliness \\nhad confused bureaucrats and investors \\nalike. The new goal is clearer, but Mr Suga \\nwill have to prove it is not just an empty \\npledge. “The government doesn't yet havea \\nclear vision as to how to achieve the target, \\nbut the target is a way to Start the conversa- \\ntion,’ says Kameyama Yasuko of the Na- \\ntional Institute for Environmental Studies. \\n\\nThere are reasons to be optimistic. By \\nthe time of Mr Suga’s speech, more than160 \\nlocal governments, representing 62% of \\nthe population, had already pledged zero \\nemissions by 2050, up from just four a year \\nago. Many leading Japanese companies, \\nfrom consumer brands like Sony and Pana- \\nsonic to industrial firms like Sumitomo \\nChemical, have adopted ambitious emis- \\nsions targets. Even Keidanren, a powerful \\nbusiness lobby that is a bastion of heavy in- \\ndustry, has started talking about decarbon- \\nisation. “The energy-intensive industries \\nthat oppose climate mitigation have be- \\ncomea minority,’ says Ms Kameyama. \\n\\nThe targets set by other countries seem \\nto have influenced Mr Suga. “It’s kind of \\nShameful for Japan to be lagging behind \\nChina,’ says Sugiyama Masahiro of the \\nUniversity of Tokyo. Joe Biden has prom- \\nised to make America carbon-neutral by \\n2050 if elected president; Japanese officials \\ndo not want to be left bucking a global con- \\nsensus. (Two days after Mr Suga’s an- \\nnouncement, South Korea also pledged to \\nbe carbon-neutral by 2050.) \\n\\nThe obvious first step is to raise targets \\nfor renewable energy.

While insist- \\ning it did nothing wrong, J&J signalled this \\nmonth that it is willing to cough up $5bn if \\na comprehensive settlement can be agreed. \\nFor the world’s largest drug firm, with \\nannual revenues of $56bn, sucha hit would \\nbe a publicity nightmare but financially \\nmanageable. For smaller fry, litigation can \\nprove fatal. On October12th Mallinckrodt, a \\nbig purveyor of generic opioids, agreed to \\npay $1.6bn in a settlement as it filed for \\nbankruptcy. On October 21st the Doj an- \\nnounced that Purdue Pharma, the most \\nprominent opioids producer, which folded  >» roughly $8bn.

Quan- \\ntitative easing (QE) is often cited as an ex- \\nample. Buying government bonds with \\nnewly created money is surely the kind of \\nindulgence best left to the rich world.

Contrary to some fears, this has not \\nso far brought disaster. Indeed the early ev- \\nidence suggests it has worked quite well. \\n\\nAt least18 central banks have carried out \\nasset-purchase programmes of some kind, \\naccording to the IMF. Policymakers in \\nsome countries, such as Chile, Hungary \\nand Poland, resorted to them because they \\nhad already lowered interest rates about as \\nfar as they could go. Others, however, had \\ndifferent motives. In some countries the \\nauthorities admitted that bond-buying had \\na partly fiscal aim. The central bank’s pur- \\nchases would help finance the govern- \\nment’s efforts to fight the pandemic. The \\nBank of Ghana, bought a “covid-19 relief \\nbond” worth 5.5bn cedi ($950m) from the \\ngovernmentin May to help fill its financing \\ngap. In the Philippines, Rosalia De Leon,  the national treasurer, described the cen- \\ntral bank’s purchases as an “extra lifeline” \\nfor the government. \\n\\nA third group of central banks, includ- \\ning those in India and South Africa, bought \\nbonds for a subtler reason: to help make a \\nmarket for them. Their aim was not simply \\nto lift bond prices, but also to reduce their \\nvolatility and narrow a widening gap be- \\ntween the prices demanded by prospective \\nsellers and those offered by potential buy- \\ners. In addition, by acting as a buyer of last \\nresort, central bankers hoped to embolden \\nother, private buyers of earlier resort. \\n\\nSure enough, the announcement of \\nthese measures helped reduce bond yields, \\nsays the IMF's latest global financial stabil- \\nity report, by about 0.2 to 0.6 percentage \\npoints. They also helped to reduce the \\n“term premium’, or the extra yield inves- \\ntors demand to hold a long-term bond rath- \\ner than a series of short-term ones.

       "  'HE SCHLESWIG-HOLSTEIN question, a \\nfpr diplomatic teaser, was \\nSaid to be so complicated that of the three \\npeople who had ever understood it, one \\nhad forgotten it all, another was dead and \\nthe third driven mad. Readers of the Euro- \\npean Commission’s 108-page “Vade Me- \\ncum” on the Stability and Growth Pact \\n(SGP), the European Union’s fiscal rule \\nbook, might sympathise. Over the years the \\nrules have sprouted a head-spinning array \\nof exceptions, interpretative possibilities \\nand get-out clauses. No finance minister in \\nEurope fully understands them, says a \\nBrussels insider. \\n\\nYet at the heart of the Eu’s rules lie two \\nsimple figures, anchored in the Maastricht \\ntreaty of 1992: governments should aim to \\nrun budget deficits no higher than 3% of \\nGDP and tocap the public-debt stock at 60% \\nof GpPp. As countries prepared to enter a \\nmonetary union without a central fiscal \\nauthority, rules were needed to bind the \\nhands of the spendthrift. The quid pro quo \\nfor strict rules was a politicised process of \\nenforcement. In 2003 France and Germany \\nexceeded the deficit threshold and then \\ncowed the rest of the Eu into letting them \\nescape unpunished; an early blow to the \\nrule book’s credibility from which some \\nSay it never recovered. No country has ever \\nfaced the fines that notionally apply to seri- \\nous miscreants.  The fiscal rules have been periodically \\ntweaked over the years. Brussels shifted \\naway from headline targets to focus on \\n“structural” deficits that sought to strip out \\nthe effect of the business cycle. But conjur- \\ning reliable estimates in real time has been \\nimpossible—often forcing governments to \\ntighten prematurely. In 201 members \\nagreed that debt levels over the 60% limit \\nshould be cut by one-twentieth each year. \\nThe “fiscal compact”, passed at the urging \\nof Germany in 2012, obliges governments \\nto try to keep structural deficits close to \\nzero. In 2015 the commission clarified the \\ncases in which exemptions could be grant- \\ned, including structural reforms with up- \\nfront costs, and public investment. \\n\\nAll this gave birth to the monster Eu- \\nrope knows today. This proliferation of \\nrules has enabled more nuanced negotia- \\ntions between the commission and gov- \\nernments, argues Gregory Claeys of Brue- \\ngel, a think-tank in Brussels. The price is a \\nloss of accountability and transparency. \\nThe commission might instruct a finance \\nminister, accountable to a national parlia- \\nment, to shave a few points off their deficit \\nwhile dangling the prospect of later invok- \\ning an escape clause—and a few months \\nlater, when the cyclically adjusted deficit \\nhas been recalculated, say something dif- \\nferent. “That’s when you start debating, \\nshould I tell the prime minister or should I \\njust ignore the blighters?” says Thomas \\nWieser, a former euro-zone Official.

The quiet con- \\ntemplation ofa violinist as he practises be- \\nfore a closed upper-floor window. One of \\nthe more unexpected sensations prompted \\nby the Centre Pompidou’s major new exhi- \\nbition, “Matisse, like a novel”, is that the \\nartist inadvertently captures life in lock- \\ndown: the confined angular indoor spaces, \\nthe teasing promise of open windows, the \\nglimpse ofa brighter life beyond. \\n\\nIn 1908 Henri Matisse wrote of his own \\nwork: “What I dream of is an art of balance, \\nof purity and serenity, devoid of troubling \\nor depressing subject matter...a soothing, \\ncalming influence on the mind.” His asso- \\nciation with decorative art, and his defiant \\nuse of vibrant colour, earned him a reputa- \\ntion as a painter of bonheur. The chance to \\nsee “Interior with aubergines’” (1911), for ex- \\nample, a vast canvas that vibrates with flo- \\nral motifs and fabrics and disrupts space \\nand dimension, lent for the exhibition by \\nthe Museum of Grenoble, is indeed a sheer \\ndelight. As are the original, vivacious “Jazz” \\ncut-outs (1943-46) or “Red interior, still life \\nona blue table” (14947), one of Matisse’s last \\nworks in oil, on loan from Dusseldorf. \\n\\nLooking at his paintings at a time of \\npandemic, though, is a reminder of how \\nmuch more there is to him. The Pompidou \\nhad to postpone the exhibition, which \\nmarks the 150th anniversary of Matisse’s \\nbirth, from May this year because of co- \\nvid-19 (it finally opened last week). It has \\nreduced the number of tickets sold each \\nday to meet health rules, and closes early to \\nconform with the nightly curfew in Paris. \\nOver 230 works are on display, although \\nnone from Russia or private American col- \\nlections. In a nod to the title of Louis Ara- \\ngon’s work “Matisse, a novel”, exhibits are \\norganised around the thoughts of nine \\nwriters on the painter, and the interplay be- \\ntween his art and the written word. \\n\\nItis the windows, though, that seize the \\nlockdown eye. Unlike the English-style \\nvertical-sliding sash version, French dou- \\nble casement windows seem designed to \\nbe thrown wide open, to blur the interior \\nand exterior worlds. Raised in northern \\nFrance, Matisse was enchanted by the Med- \\niterranean light, and brought it in to fuse \\ninside and out. “Red interior, still life ona \\nblue table” boldly blends both perspectives  in a profusion of red and gold. “Interior \\nwith goldfish’, painted from his fourth- \\nfloor Paris studio on the Quai Saint-Michel \\nin 1914, on the eve of war, speaks more of \\nsolitude. A translucent wash of light on the \\nIle de la Cité beckons through the window, \\nframed by the sombre greys and Prussian \\nblues of walls and furniture.

Holding other factors \\nconstant, the more people have protective \\nantibodies, the slower the virus spreads. If \\nenough people become and remain im- \\nmune, further outbreaks are prevented. \\n\\nSome experts have advised letting the \\nyoung and healthy get covid-19, in order to \\napproach such herd immunity. European \\ndata suggest this goal remains distant: \\nwithin countries, the regions with the \\nmost cases in the spring also tend to have \\nthe biggest outbreaks now. Yet broad aver- \\nages can obscure local variation. And new \\nItalian data show that the worst-hit places \\ndo now enjoy some degree of immunity. \\n\\nLike a tornado, covid-19 has walloped \\nsome towns while sparing others. In Lom- \\nbardy, the heart of Italy’s first wave, 83% \\nmore people died of all causes from March \\nto June than the historical average, an ex- \\ncess representing 0.3% of the population. \\nYet some pockets of the region were hit dis- \\nproportionately. The rate was 0.6% of the \\npopulation in Bergamo province, and more \\nthan 1% in 30 of Bergamo’s 243 municipal- \\nities. If anywhere has enough antibodies to \\nrestrain covid-19, it would be these towns. \\n\\nLombardy’s government does not share \\ncase counts for every area. But Isaia Inver- \\nnizzi, a journalist, has gained access to its \\ninternal data, which show that the hardest- \\nhit towns are doing unusually well today. \\nSince September ist, municipalities with \\nfirst-wave excess deaths of at least 0.5% of \\nthe population have tallied 216 cases per \\n100,000 people—one-third as many as in \\nareas with excess deaths around 0.1%. \\n\\nSocial distancing has also slowed the vi- \\nrus. According to Google, Lombards moved \\naround 24% less in July than in January, the \\nsteepest drop in Italy. But this decline has \\nbeen similar in all of Lombardy. That leaves \\nimmunity as the best explanation for dif- \\nferences in case counts within the region. \\n\\nThese data do not prove the case for \\nseeking herd immunity. Without a vaccine, \\nthe cost of gaining even mild resistance is \\ngrim. No national study has found a share \\nof people with antibodies even one-third \\nas high as the 24% seen in Bergamo in July. \\nAnd Europe's highest national excess death \\nrate, in Spain, is justa fifth of Bergamo’s. \\n\\nYet for beleaguered Bergamasques, the \\ndata are good news.

On February 4th China re- \\ncorded 3,887 new cases. On March 4th the \\nnumber was 139. The report that the wHO \\ngroup published on February 28th put the \\ngood results down to the way that the state \\nhad used manpower and technology to im- \\nplement quarantine meticulously on an \\nunprecedented scale. It did not go into the \\ndisturbing mechanisms of state power em- \\nployed to that end. \\n\\nAll over the country cities closed down \\nschools, public transport and almost all so- \\ncial and economic activity to stop people  from moving around. In Wuhan, a city of \\num, people have been restricted to their \\nhomes for five weeks. The lockdown was \\nenforced not just by the network of officials \\nwhich covers every block of flats, street and \\nalley but also, under the influence of those \\nofficials, by the property managers at resi- \\ndential compounds. In some villages life is \\nnow relatively unconstrained; there are re- \\nports that in others every visitor has to be \\ncleared by a local party boss. The top-down \\nset-up lends itself to excessive alacrity \\namong the lower echelons. Missing a target \\nis less dangerous than overstepping the \\nmark. Hence the (swiftly censored) online \\nvideos showing police smashing Mahjong \\ntables, people being paraded or tied to trees \\nfor failing to wear face-masks, or a scream- \\ning woman barricaded in her home with \\niron bars. \\n\\nHow less thuggish states can achieve \\nsimilar results remains to be seen. In South \\nKorea, the country with the most cases out- \\nside China, stringent measures widely sup- \\nported by the public may be slowing the \\nrate of spread. A drop has definitely been  seen in Singapore, where pandemic pre- \\nparedness became a priority after the SARS \\noutbreak of 2003. The city-state knows \\nwhere all but 12 of the 12 cases it has seen \\ngot infected. \\n\\nBut whether the isolation of whole \\ntowns in northern Italy has done much to \\ncurb the outbreak there remains to be seen. \\nIn Iran there is no evidence as yet of any \\noverarching control at all. And in America \\nthe response to date has been a shambolic \\nmissed opportunity. Shockingly, the worst \\nAmerican bungling has more in common \\nwith the catastrophic early stages of the \\nChinese epidemic—when officials min- \\nimised risks and punished truth-tellers, \\nthus letting the disease spread much fur- \\nther and faster than it might have—than \\nwith the country’s later co-ordinated con- \\ntrol efforts.

Six months \\nago, none of them had met. Now, they have \\njust one month left to show that they can \\nreinvent the French democratic process— \\nand help save the planet. “It’s our moment,” \\nSylvain, one of the delegates, tells his col- \\nleagues from the podium. “We have the \\nchance to propose something historic.” \\n\\nOn March 6th the “citizens’ climate con- \\nvention” was due to begin its penultimate \\nthree-day sitting, the sixth since it began \\nwork last October. The convention is made \\nup of a representative sample of the French \\npopulation, selected by randomly generat- \\ned telephone numbers. President Emman-  uel Macron devised it in an attempt to calm \\nthe country after the gilets jaunes (yellow \\njackets) crisis of 2018. In response to the de- \\nmand for less top-down decision-making, \\nhe first launched what he grandly called a \\n“great national debate”, which took place a \\nyear ago. He also pledged the creation of a \\ncitizens’ assembly. It is designed to focus \\non precisely the conundrum that provoked \\nthe original protests against a rise in the \\ncarbon tax on motor fuel: how to make \\ngreen policy palatable, efficient and fair. \\n\\n“Tt was a real shock at first,” says Guy, a \\nretired computer technician from Limou- \\nsin, in central France, “because I realised \\nthat all the common-sense things we are \\ndoing are far from enough to stop climate \\nchange.” When delegates began travelling \\nto Paris for their monthly sessions, they \\ntook evidence from experts, listened to \\npresentations, and studied. “I didn’t know \\nwhat to expect.

Months later a News- \\nweek reporter was expelled from Moscow. \\nAmerica retaliated by kicking out a corre- \\nspondent for Tass, the Soviet news agency. \\nThe American government has not played \\nthis game since the cold war, but it is re- \\nsuming now, with a different adversary. \\n\\nOn March 2nd, less than two weeks after \\nChina expelled three journalists for the \\nWall Street Journal, the State Department \\nannounced that it was placing a cap of 100 \\non the number of Chinese citizens who \\ncould be employed in America for five \\nstate- and Communist Party-owned media \\norganisations—a reduction from their cur- \\nrent total of 160. The cap, effective from \\nMarch 13th, means that up to 60 Chinese \\nnationals will be forced to leave, a dip- \\nlomatic swipe that adds a new tension to \\nthe relationship. \\n\\nChina’s ejection of the reporters came a \\nday after the Trump administration desig- \\nnated the five state- and party-owned me- \\ndia outlets as foreign missions of the Chi- \\nnese government, to reflect their function \\nas propaganda instruments, officials said, \\nas opposed to independent news organisa- \\ntions. The five are: Xinhua, CGTN, China \\nDaily, China Radio International and the \\ndistribution arm of People’s Daily, the \\nparty’s mouthpiece. \\n\\nAdministration officials said the visa \\ncaps were meant to establish “more reci- \\nprocity” with China in how the countries \\ntreat journalists. (American news organi- \\nsations in mainland China employ about \\n75 non-Chinese citizens, including Ameri- \\ncans.) They argued that Chinese state me- \\ndia employees in the United States still op- \\nerate unencumbered, working and \\npublishing as they (or their employers) \\nplease, while American journalists in Chi- \\nna face harassment, intimidation and the \\nthreat of expulsion. \\n\\nThe expulsion of the Wall Street Journal \\nreporters putatively came as punishment \\nfor a headline in the newspaper’s opinion \\npages that described China as the “sick \\nman of Asia”.

Lori \\nLightfoot, the city’s mayor for the past nine \\nmonths, has made cutting poverty her \\nmain goal. Like the rest of the country, the \\ncity is doing well on this score: the poverty \\nrate for Afrian-Americans and Hispanics \\nhas been creeping down, though that has \\nmore to do with low unemployment and \\ndecent wage growth than with City Hall. \\n\\nMs Lightfoot, who grew up poor in Ohio, \\nspeaks personally about privation. Her \\nchildhood taught her “what hardship and \\nfinancial struggle was all about”. Though \\nher father had three jobs, the family saw \\ncars repossessed and services cut off for \\nunpaid bills. She put herself through col- \\nlege and studied law. Her first summer job \\npaid more than her father had ever earned. \\nShe was too embarrassed to tell him. \\n\\nThis sort of story is still common in Chi- \\ncago. In its public schools 76% of students \\nqualify for free meals because of low in- \\ncomes. When classes end, many do with- \\nout nutritious food. Life-expectancy can \\nvary by as much as 15 years between neigh- \\nbouring areas on the South Side. Ms Light- \\nfoot points out that Cook County, which in- \\ncludes the Windy City, has the highest rate \\nof personal bankruptcies in Illinois—often \\nbecause people owe debts to the city. \\n\\nMs Lightfoot traces inequality’s roots in \\nAmerica to the “original sin of slavery”, and \\nblames government for keeping black fam- \\nilies down. She cites redlining, a practice of \\ncity governments and mortgage-lenders to \\ndetermine which neighbourhoods Afri- \\ncan-Americans were allowed to live in, and \\nthe de facto segregation of black children at \\nschool. A mayor cannot do much about \\nthat history, and in any case many of her \\nplans are small-bore. She will start by \\nscrapping city fines and fees that burden \\nthe poor especially—as a small example, li- \\nbraries no longer charge for overdue books. \\nShe wants more rights for tenants and the \\nend of regulations that take away drivers’ \\nlicences for petty infractions, because los- \\ning acar often means losing a job. \\n\\nShe promises an extra $750m over the \\nnext three years to spruce up roads, parks \\nand public transport in ten corridors run- \\nning through needy districts. Philanthro- \\npists and foundations will be tapped for \\nhelp. She will also expand a financial mod- \\nel that diverts some capital from firms  town to boost small businesses in poor ar- \\neas. Rahm Emanuel, her predecessor, \\nlaunched that scheme in 2017 and says it \\nwill soon be worth $170m. \\n\\nOne of Ms Lightfoot’s plans is genuinely \\nradical, however. Citing the “outrageous \\namounts of money that we spend on a \\ncriminal-justice infrastructure that is \\nmostly punitive’—over $1.7bn a year for \\npolicing—she wants to switch spending to \\nsocial and economic needs.

       "  'die SYRIAN army is still better at stealing \\nrefrigerators than at fighting rebels. But \\nafter a decade of war it at last looked to be \\nlearning better tactics. Instead of sending \\nlone tanks to bounce through the hills, \\nsome units fighting in Idlib, the last oppo- \\nsition-held province, have worked togeth- \\ner, with columns of armour backed by in- \\nfantry. In recent days, though, grainy \\nblack-and-white footage has shown those \\ntanks being pulverised from overhead, \\ntheir crews helpless to fight back. \\n\\nLong accustomed to squaring off with \\nill-equipped rebels, Bashar al-Assad’s men \\nare unexpectedly battling the second-larg- \\nest army in NATO. The clash began on Feb- \\nruary 27th when an air strike on a Turkish \\nconvoy killed at least 36 soldiers, the dead- \\nliest attack on Turkish troops in more than \\ntwo decades. It is still unclear whether Syri- \\nan or Russian jets dropped the bombs. But \\nTurkey has chosen to respond to Syria with \\na barrage of drone strikes and artillery that \\nhave dealt Mr Assad’s regime its worst blow \\nin years. It has also brought Turkey to the  brink of conflict with Russia, Mr Assad’s \\nbiggest foreign backer. \\n\\nAs The Economist went to press, the lead- \\ners of Russia and Turkey were to hold a \\nmeeting in Moscow. President Recep Tay- \\nyip Erdogan entered with a stronger hand \\nthan he had just weeks ago. He wants to \\nstop the Syrian regime from retaking Idlib \\nand forcing millions more desperate refu- \\ngees across the border. Caught between a \\nfurious Mr Erdogan and a recalcitrant Mr \\nAssad, Vladimir Putin cannot offer much. \\nHe and Mr Erdogan might agree on a new \\ndemarcation line to separate Turkish and \\nSyrian troops, an updated version of the \\ndeal they made in Sochi in 2018—which \\nquickly fell apart. That may only delay the \\nreckoning, but may be enough to stanch \\nthe current fighting. In the long run, Tur-  key’s intervention may also benefit Russia, \\nby demonstrating to the Syrian regime that \\nit cannot endure without Russian support. \\n\\nThat should now be painfully clear to \\nMr Assad. Although there are no precise \\nstatistics on his losses (both sides have an \\nincentive to fudge them), even regime loy- \\nalists say hundreds of Syrian soldiers have \\nbeen killed by Turkish strikes. The casual- \\nties also include members of Hizbullah, a \\nLebanese militia that backs Mr Assad, and \\nother Iranian-trained militias stocked with \\nAfghan and Pakistani fighters. A video \\nposted on social media showed Syrian \\ntroops roaming Idlib in an ambulance (it- \\nself a war crime), desperately trying to hide \\nfrom Turkish missiles. Scores of Syrian \\ntanks have been destroyed or captured. \\n\\nTurkey hit back mostly with unmanned \\ndrones.

       "  'UST FIVE years ago the Rajapaksa family \\nJ seemed to have lost everything. Mahinda \\nRajapaksa was beaten in Sri Lanka’s presi- \\ndential race in 2015, ending his ten-year \\ntenure. His younger brother, Gotabaya, was \\nno longer number two (to Mahinda) in the \\nministry of defence. Basil, the baby of the \\nbrood, had lost his job as minister of eco- \\nnomic development, and their eldest sib- \\nling, Chamal, would soon be ousted as \\nspeaker of parliament. Worse, the incom- \\ning government was threatening to prose- \\ncute varied Rajapaksas and their allies for \\neverything from corruption to human- \\nrights abuses. \\n\\nBut five years is an age in politics. Saho- \\ndara Samagama or Brothers Inc, as Sri Lan- \\nkans jokingly call the resilient political \\nclan that first entered parliament three \\ngenerations ago, in 1936, is very much back \\nin business. In November Gota, as he is  widely known, captured the presidency in \\nalandslide. He picked Mahinda, the former \\npresident, to be his prime minister. Cha- \\nmal is still an MP and Basil, though out of \\ngovernment, runs the family’s political \\nparty, the Sri Lanka People’s Front (known \\nby its Sinhala initials sLPP). Few Sri Lan- \\nkans doubt that when polls open for a new \\nparliament on April 25th, the nine-party \\ncoalition he has stitched will romp home. \\n\\nYet for the Rajapaksas, capture of the \\npresidency, the cabinet and, in all probabil- \\nity, the legislature (in addition to consider- \\nable influence in the army, the police, the \\ncourts and much of the media) may not be \\nenough. What they would really like is not \\nmerely a parliamentary majority but a two- \\nthirds majority. That way they could roll \\nback constitutional changes brought in by \\nthe previous government that trimmed the \\npresident’s powers. They could also, fear \\nsome among the 30% of the island’s 22m \\npeople who are not part of the Sinhalese \\nBuddhist majority, scrap efforts to recon- \\ncile the country’s different ethnicities and \\nreligions after the murderous civil war of \\n1983-2009. Rival politicians and liberal \\ntypes, meanwhile, worry that they will re- \\ndouble the assault on civil liberties that \\ntook place when Mahinda was president. \\n\\nSigns of such intentions are already \\nshowing. After Gota became president in \\nNovember he placed the civilian police and \\nthe registration of NGOs under the control \\nof the defence ministry.

       "  'T THE END Of last year the Communist \\nParty decided to deflect some of the in- \\nternational opprobrium it was earning be- \\ncause of its vast network of detention facil- \\nities in the western region of Xinjiang. \\nSince 2017 perhaps 1m Uighurs, a predomi- \\nnantly Muslim group indigenous to the \\narea, have been thrown into the prison \\ncamps, which are officially referred to as \\nvocational-training centres. Offences in- \\nclude even the most innocuous forms of \\npiety, such as sporting long beards. The \\nparty had claimed the centres were neces- \\nsary to “deradicalise” potential terrorists. \\nFew outsiders accepted this implausible \\nargument. So in December Xinjiang’s gov- \\nernment declared that “all trainees” in the \\ncamps had “graduated”. \\nWhere are they now? A report published \\non March 1st by the Australian Strategic \\nPolicy Institute (ASPI), a think-tank in Can-  berra, reveals that some former detainees \\nin Xinjiang have swapped one form of coer- \\ncion for another, and have been obliged to \\ngo work in other provinces. In 2017-19, the \\nstudy found, more than 80,000 Uighurs \\nwere shipped out of Xinjiang to take jobs in \\nfactories across China under conditions \\nthat “strongly suggest forced labour’. An \\nanalysis of government documents sug- \\ngests that many prisoners were transferred \\ndirectly from the detention centres to their \\nnew workplaces. \\n\\nVicky Xu, the study’s lead author, found \\nthat at least 27 factories in nine provinces \\nbenefit from this labour-transfer scheme. \\nMany are links in supply chains of promi- \\nnent Western brands like Apple, Dell, Mer- \\ncedes-Benz and Nike. Not all such compa- \\nnies may be aware of this, since big multi- \\nnationals are unlikely to deal directly with \\nevery subcontractor. \\n\\nChina’s government openly admits that \\nit arranges for the transfer of “surplus” Ui- \\nghur workers in Xinjiang to the rest of Chi- \\nna. The scheme, meant to reduce poverty, is \\nknown as “Xinjiang Aid”. Factories in \\nwealthy coastal provinces, which tend to \\nbe short of labour, offer higher wages than \\nmost forms of manual work in Xinjiang, a \\npoorer region. The government insists that \\nparticipation in the programme is entirely \\nvoluntary. The foreign ministry impugns \\nthe integrity of ASPI, accusing it, without \\nevidence, of ties with the “us government \\nand arms dealers”. \\n\\nMs Xu acknowledges that there may bea \\n“genuinely” voluntary component. Even \\nso, her research indicates that once Uighur \\nworkers arrive on factory sites, their free- \\ndoms are severely curbed. Satellite imagery \\nand first-hand accounts compiled by Ms Xu \\nand her co-authors paint a disturbing pic- \\nture. Uighur workers live in segregated \\nquarters and eat in separate canteens from \\ntheir ethnic-Han comrades. In some fac- \\ntories Uighurs are paid less for the same \\nwork.

       "  'D URING THE financial crisis of \\n2007-09, American banks were part \\nof the problem. As the covid-19 disease \\nspreads, and efforts to halt it threaten to \\ncause a cash crunch, they could be part of \\nthe solution. Company revenues may \\ntumble but firms will still need to cover \\nwages, leases and loans. Workers— \\nespecially temporary or gig ones—may \\nnot be paid, but mortgage or rent pay- \\nments and credit-card bills will pile up. \\nThe banks (maybe backed by the govern- \\nment) will need to plug the gap. \\n\\nOrdinarily, such stresses would in- \\ndicate insolvency and banks would \\nattempt to collect. But this crisis is differ- \\nent. There is a reasonable expectation \\nthat the cash crunch will be temporary. \\nWhen activity resumes payments can \\nonce again start flowing. \\n\\nAmerica has recently endured a \\nsmall-scale version of sucha cashflow \\ncrisis. From December 22nd 2018 the \\ngovernment was shut down for 35 days, \\nresulting in delays to the wage payments \\nof 800,000 federal employees. According \\nto Prudential, an insurance company,  half of the federal employees it surveyed \\nmissed bill payments, like utilities or \\nphone bills, and a quarter missed making \\na mortgage payment. \\n\\nMany banks at the time acted to min- \\nimise financial hardship, by agreeing to \\ndelays in mortgage payments, waiving \\ncredit-card interest and overdraft fees, \\nallowing early access to fixed-term de- \\nposits and offering low- or no-interest \\nshort-term financing to some customers. \\nThere were some long-term effects, like \\nlower credit scores, but few major ones. \\n\\nIf such measures are required fora \\nlonger period, the pressures on banks to \\nlend or offer forbearance might clash \\nwith post-crisis regulatory restrictions. \\nBig banks already report seeing “flight to \\nquality” deposits pouring in. But le- \\nverage ratios constrain bank balance- \\nsheets. More deposits might induce \\nbanks to cut back on other activities. \\n\\nNo one is served by defaults on the \\npart of borrowers who would have been \\nsolvent but for the epidemic. The ques- \\ntion for banks, their customers and their \\nregulators is how these can be avoided.  > bond trades. A big question is, can such \\nplatforms make up for the diminution of \\nold-school sources of liquidity? \\n\\nUntil 2008, the ease with which inves- \\ntors could trade corporate bonds relied on \\nthe willingness of big investment banks to \\nhoard securities. These telephone-based \\ndealers would buy bonds during periods of \\nheavy selling and warehouse them for \\nwhen investors were willing to bid for \\nthem again.

Afterwards in- \\nvestigators found dangerous levels of \\nmethane, poor ventilation, faulty ma- \\nchines, broken water-sprinklers and thick, \\nsight-obscuring clouds of coal dust. The \\nmine’s owner, Massey Energy Company, \\nwas subsequently bought by a rival; its boss \\nat the time, Don Blankenship, was convict- \\ned of a misdemeanour in 2015 and serveda \\nyear in prison.

The accounts, delivered by actors but \\ncollected from survivors—and accompa- \\nnied by Steve Earle’s Appalachian banjo \\nand guitar—are riveting. They tell a tale of \\ncorporate greed and silenced dissent. \\nThese are men who followed their fathers \\nand grandfathers into the pits, firm in the \\nbelief that the work was honest and safe. \\nWhen Gary Quarles (played by Thomas Ko- \\npache), whose son died in the disaster, be- \\ngan mining in 1976, the union saw to it that \\nshifts lasted eight hours, lunches could be \\neaten sitting down and “you didn’t worry \\n‘bout gettin’ fired by speakin’ up.” \\n\\nWhen Massey bought the lucrative \\nmine in 1994, the union was sidelined. \\n“Safety started goin’ out the window,” re- \\ncalls Stanley Stuart (Michael Gaston), a \\nminer better known as Goose. Months be- \\nfore the explosion, he sensed the facility \\nwas a “ticking time-bomb”. He left a record \\nof the firm’s hazardous practices for his \\nwife, so she could sue if anything hap- \\npened to him. He suspected his days were \\nnumbered, but options were scarce in rural \\nWest Virginia, and this was the only job he \\never knew. \\n\\nVerbatim theatre—in which the drama \\nis adapted from real-life documents and \\ntranscripts—has been used to explore topi- \\ncal issues and historic events in Britain and \\nRussia. Ms Blank and Mr Jensen, who are \\nmarried and regular collaborators, are \\namong its most accomplished exponents \\nin America. “The Exonerated”, their play \\nbased on interviews with more than 40 ex- \\nonerated death-row inmates, has been pro-  duced around the world.

China’s strict quarantine \\nhas led toa 90% decline in new infections, \\nwhereas outbreaks in Italy and Iran have \\ngrown rapidly. In the last week of February \\n70% of new diagnoses were outside of Chi- \\nna. As covid-19 reaches countries unwilling \\nor unable to monitor it, officials must use \\neducated guesswork to track its evolution. \\n\\nThe number of cases each country re- \\nports depends both on the number of infec- \\ntions and on how many people get tested. \\nBy March 1st South Korea had tested over \\n100,000 people; America just 472. \\n\\nTo estimate the number of undetected \\ncases, scholars can make use of patterns in \\nmore complete data. One model, built by a \\nteam at Harvard, used the number of peo- \\nple flying from Hubei province in China, \\nwhere the outbreak began, to various coun- \\ntries to predict imported cases. Such data \\nare less relevant now, because Hubei has \\nbeen locked down fora month. \\n\\nTo derive fresh estimates, The Economist \\nbuilt a similar model. We tested the link \\nwithin the O—EcD—a club of mostly rich \\ncountries, which should have strong detec- \\ntion capacity—between Chinese tourism \\nin 2019 and confirmed covid-19 cases. As \\nexpected, OECD states that swapped lots of \\ntourists with China, such as Switzerland, \\ntend to report higher infection rates than \\ndo ones with small flows, like Belgium. \\n\\nApplied worldwide, our model finds big \\noutliers. The outbreaks in Iran, Italy and \\nSouth Korea, where the virus is spreading \\ninternally, are bigger than tourist flows \\nsuggest. At the other extreme, countries \\nlike Singapore may have fewer diagnoses \\nthan expected because of strong contain- \\nment efforts. But the Philippines, Russia, \\nMyanmar and Indonesia have lots of peo- \\nple and tourism to and from China, and just \\neight confirmed cases in total. Thousands \\nmore have probably gone undetected. \\n\\nAnother pattern bolsters this finding. \\nSouth Korea and China test regularly. In \\nboth places—excluding Hubei, where the \\nvirus began claiming lives before authori- \\nties formulated a response—o.5-1% of peo- \\nple who have tested positive have died. In \\nother countries with at least one death, this \\nrate is five times higher. Deaths are easier \\nto count than infections are.

       "  'S THE STATE Of Bihar went to the polls at \\n\\nthe end of October, its 125m citizens \\nwere contending with both the pandemic \\nand the associated economic slump. \\nWould they punish the Bharatiya Janata \\nParty (BJP) of the prime minister, Narendra \\nModi? Exit polls suggested they might. \\n\\nBut when the results were released on \\nNovember uth, they showed the BjP and its \\nlocal ally, the Janata Dal (United) (JDU), \\nwinning roughly the same share of the vote \\nas their biggest challengers, a coalition of \\nthe local Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), leftist \\nparties and Congress, a much enfeebled \\nparty that nonetheless remains the only \\nnationwide rival to the ByP. In terms of \\nseats in the state assembly, the Bjp’s alli- \\nance actually won a narrow majority. And \\nwithin the alliance it was the BjP that per- \\nformed best, winning most of the seats it \\ncontested. The JDU, whose leader, Nitish \\nKumar, has served three near-consecutive \\nterms as Bihar’s chief minister, floundered. \\n\\n“The ByP has achieved exactly what it \\nwanted in Bihar, which is to have a govern- \\nment but to cut Nitish Kumar down to size,” \\nSays Pavan Varma, a former adviser to Mr \\nKumar. To make things sweeter for the BJP, \\nCongress won only a meagre 19 of the 70 \\nseats it fought. Better yet for Mr Modi, the \\nElection Commission declared his party \\nthe winner in dozens of local by-elections \\nthat were held simultaneously in 11 other \\nStates. Most significantly it strengthened \\nits hold on the pivotal state of Madhya Pra- \\ndesh, returning underits banner aclutch of \\ndeputies whose defection from Congress \\nlast year gave the BJP a narrow majority in \\nthe state assembly. \\n\\nGiven that India’s economy has shrunk \\nperhaps by 10% since covid-19 hit and that \\nmore than 128,000 people have died from \\nthe disease, this was a stellar performance. \\nSix years into office and 18 months after \\nwinning a landslide national election, Mr \\nModi has not only kept his own sheen \\nbright but has also expanded his party’s in- \\nfluence. The serial humiliation of Con- \\ngress, now widely blamed for dragging \\ndown the opposition’s “grand alliance” in \\nBihar, will further shrink its bargaining \\npower in other states where it needs allies \\nto challenge the ByP. And by outshining his \\nown ally in Bihar, Mr Modi has again shown \\nthe effectiveness of a tactic that has trans- \\nformed the ByPp from a regional party to the \\ndominant political force across India. In \\nState after state it has gained power with  the help of alocal partner, only to eclipse it \\ngradually with the help of its vastly greater \\nfinancial resources and the disciplined \\nground troops provided by Hindu- \\nnationalist groups allied to the party. \\n\\nTo be fair, the BJP’s narrow victory in Bi- \\nhar owes as much to the fragmenting of its \\nopponents in a first-past-the-post system \\nas to its own potency.

In July the local govern- \\nment barred 12 politicians, including four \\nsitting members of Legco, from standing in \\nelections that were due to be held in Sep- \\ntember. It accused them of opposing the \\nnew law and other political misbehaviour. \\nShortly afterwards it postponed the elec- \\ntions fora year, citing the pandemic. \\n\\nEarly this month police arrested eight \\nopposition politicians, including five \\nLegco members, for their alleged involve-  ment in a scuffle in the chamber. Then \\ncame the ruling by the parliament in Bei- \\njing, the National People’s Congress (NPC), \\nthat resulted in the final purge and, on the \\nSame day, Mrs Lam’s chilling response. It \\nSaid Hong Kong’s government could disbar \\nany legislator who did not accept Chinese \\nrule in Hong Kong or who otherwise violat- \\ned national security. \\n\\nThe Hong Kong authorities responded \\nswiftly to the NPc’s edict. It declared that \\nthe four legislators who had been barred \\nfrom re-election would also be stripped of \\ntheir seats. In response, 15 other opposition \\nlawmakers held a press conference to an- \\nnounce they would resign in sympathy (see \\npicture). With two others from their camp \\nhaving already stepped down in September \\nin protest against the postponement of the \\npolls, their move would leave Legco with \\nno opposition voice for the first time in de- \\ncades. The legislators were formally sub-  mitting their resignations as The Economist \\nwent to press. \\n\\nJust a year ago prospects looked much \\nbrighter for pro-democracy politicians. In \\nlocal-council elections, held in November \\n2019 during anti-government unrest that \\nhad been sweeping the city since mid-year, \\nthey made unprecedented gains.

Assault Police was born \\nout of anger, says Ms Ashraf, who also at- \\ntends AUC. “I was very frustrated that wom- \\nen's voices were not being taken seriously.” \\n\\nAround the time of Mr Zaki’s arrest, oth- \\ner cases began making headlines.

After months of ill-tem- \\npered talks between governments and the \\nEuropean Parliament—one French MEP \\neven went on hunger strike to protest \\nagainst cuts—the two sides at last agreed \\non a seven-year budget for the European \\nUnion. Some hurdles remain. Rules must \\nbe thrashed out for running the Recovery \\nand Resilience Facility (RRF), the centre- \\npiece of the covid-19 recovery plan agreed \\nby Eu leaders in July. (This, along with the \\nregular budget, makes up an overall €1.8trn \\npackage.) Viktor Orban, Hungary’s prime \\nminister, is threatening to veto the whole \\nthing because of rule-of-law conditions at- \\ntached to the budget. But officials are cau- \\ntiously optimistic that an end is in sight. \\n\\nThe deal in July empowered the Euro- \\npean Commission to borrow €750bn \\n($886bn) from capital markets and distri- \\nbute the proceeds, in grants and loans, to \\nEU governments over Six years according to \\nspecific economic criteria. The plan (see \\nchart) emerged from a fear that the di- \\nvergent effects of covid-19 could drive a \\npermanent wedge between governments. \\nIts scale sparked talk of a “Hamiltonian \\nmoment’—a watershed for EU integration. \\nIn truth, it may do more than pessimists \\nhad feared, and less than the optimists \\nhoped. \\n\\nIt has slowly dawned on governments \\nthat the recovery fund—Next Generation \\nEU (NGEU), to give it its full title—is not \\nthere to prop up short-run demand. Real \\nmoney will not start flowing until the sec- \\nond half of 2021 at best, by when the recov- \\nery should be in full swing. The bulk of the \\ngrants will not be dished out until 2024. In- \\nstead the commission hopes to use NGEU \\nto promote its own vision for long-term re- \\nform. The recovery plans governments \\nmust submit to Brussels next year will have \\nto identify projects in line with European \\npriorities. Fully 37% of the spending in the \\nRRF, for example, should go on climate- \\nfriendly schemes, such as insulating old \\nbuildings, and 20% on digital projects. A \\nsecond, related aim is to promote structur- \\nal reform in member states to lift long-term \\ngrowth rates. The commission is quietly \\nhelping governments knock their recovery \\nplans into shape, and some are struggling. \\nSo far, says an official, they are doing better \\non the investment part than on reform. \\n\\nBut Brussels will have its work cut out. \\nGovernments have their own priorities,  Croatia -9.6 \\nBulgaria -5.1 \\n\\nGreece -9.0 \\nRomania -5.2 \\nPortugal -9,3 \\nPoland -3.6 \\nSpain -12.4 \\nItaly -9.9 \\nFrance -9.4 \\nGermany -5.6  and face competing claims on any available \\ncash.

They worked well \\ntogether, says an Estonian commando. \\nCzech and Swedish special forces are due to \\narrive soon.

This \\nis part of a broader plan to improve local \\nconfidence and security. The British and \\nDanes help to provide air-lift. During Bour- \\nrasque, French soldiers worked with units \\nfrom Niger and Mali, a form of on-the-job \\ntraining that went better than expected, a \\nFrench officer says.  Certainly the mood in Gao, where one \\nrecent morning French officers could be \\nfound in the canopied mess discussing Ni- \\ngerian and Malian novelists over crois- \\nsants, is more upbeat.

Across the north of Mali, \\nthey still hold sway.

       "  'N THE MORNING after the polls closed \\n\\nlast week, America withdrew from the \\nParis agreement on climate change. The ef- \\nfects will be short-lived. President-elect \\nJoe Biden has promised to rejoin the pact as \\nsoon as he enters the White House. \\n\\nDonald Trump’s defeat has evoked \\nstrong reactions around the world. The \\nmain one “is relief”, says Andreas Nick, a \\nGerman MP. But the world will not return to \\nhow it was in 2016, and Mr Biden will not \\nplease everyone. \\n\\nConsider climate change. Most coun- \\ntries are eager to welcome America back \\ninto the club of those that care about it. In \\nthe past eight weeks, China, Japan and \\nSouth Korea have vowed to reduce net \\nemissions to zero by mid-century or there- \\nabouts. Four of the five largest economies \\nhave now committed themselves to emis- \\nsions cuts that are in line with limiting glo- \\nbal warming to 2°C above pre-industrial \\nlevels or less (See chartion next page). \\n\\nMr Biden has said he intends to adopta  target of net-zero emissions by 2050, \\nwhich modellers say will shave 0.1°C off \\ntheir temperature projections for the end \\nof the century. To rejoin the Paris deal, he \\nwill need formally to submit this goal \\nalongside an updated national pledge to \\nSlash emissions. Most observers believe a \\n45-50% decrease from 2005 levels by 2030 \\nwould be tough but feasible, fair and com- \\nmensurate with what Europe is doing. \\n\\nMr Biden can re-enter the Paris deal \\nwithout congressional approval, but he \\nwill need some degree of buy-in from both \\nsides of the aisle to make his pledges cred- \\nible. Integrating green infrastructure, ener- \\ngy, and research and development into any \\nnew government stimulus would help. \\nAmerican public opinion is broadly favour- \\nable. In exit polls two-thirds of voters said \\nthat climate change was a Serious problem. \\nWhether they will accept higher energy \\nprices to fix it remains to be seen. \\n\\nOutsiders are watching to see if Mr Bi- \\nden structures his team ina way that makes  it clear that he wants to integrate climate \\naction across his foreign and domestic \\npolicy. The importance of having America \\nback on the climate train is hard to over- \\nState. Over the past four years, voters \\naround the world have noticed not only \\nwarmer temperatures, but increasing \\nnumbers of floods, droughts and forest \\nfires. Europe is pushing through an ambi- \\ntious green deal at home and working \\nclosely with China, the world’s largest \\nemitter. If Mr Biden can formalise Ameri- \\nca’s emissions targets for 2030 and 2050 \\nbefore the CoOP26 UN climate summit next \\nyear, that will help convince other govern- \\nments that the country intends to pull its \\nweight. That should give others—includ- \\ning China—the guts to decarbonise faster. \\n\\nHowever, not all governments will wel- \\ncome a carbon warrior in the White House. \\nOil- and coal-producers are wary.

Xi Jinping is determined to assert \\nmore Communist Party authority over China’s glittering tech industry  T A SUMMIT with China's richest entre- \\njenna in late 2018 Xi Jinping sought \\nto allay concerns that the state had de- \\nclared war on the country’s private sector. \\nAlthough officials in Beijing had spent the \\nprevious year bringing to heel unruly ty- \\ncoons, China’s president insisted that ru- \\nmours of a forceful push for party influ- \\nence in the private sector were untrue. He \\nexhorted the business leaders to “take a pill \\nof reassurance’. \\n\\nThe medicine has been hard to swallow. \\nSince then the Communist Party has \\nsought a more active hand in recruitment \\nand business decisions. And after sub- \\nduing a band of headstrong bosses at over- \\nextended financial conglomerates, the \\nState is now taking aim at China’s tech bil- \\nlionaires, making it clear that outspoken \\ncritics will not be tolerated. \\n\\nMr Xi's preoccupation has always been \\nmaintaining China’s social and financial \\nStability. Keeping big business in check is \\npart of that plan. It should come as no sur- \\nprise that the state is now homing in on  tech, which has expanded rapidly (see \\nchart on next page). Six of China’s 20 most \\nvaluable listed companies are tech firms \\nand with billions of users they touch the \\nlives and wallets of almost all citizens. \\n\\nA reckoning for the sector began with \\nwhat looked like a shot across the bows of \\nChina’s largest _financial-technology \\ngroup. The suspension by regulators on \\nNovember sth of Ant Financial’s $37bn ini- \\ntial public offering with less than 48 hours’ \\nnotice was at first interpreted merely as a \\nwarning to its founder, Jack Ma, who had \\npreviously criticised China’s state-owned  banks. But on November 10th the publica- \\ntion of an extensive draft of new rules for \\ntechnology groups laid bare the state’s am- \\nbitions to bring to heel not just Ant, but the \\nwhole of China’s tech industry. \\n\\nMr Xi'’s relationship with China's ty- \\ncoons has always been troubled. When he \\nbecame president in 2013, he inherited a \\ncorporate system replete with fraud, \\npatchy regulation and surging debt. After \\nthe success of an anti-corruption cam- \\npaign that mostly targeted officials, Mr Xi \\ntook aim at a group of businessmen who \\nwere ploughing huge sums into risky over- \\nseas investments. Purchases included Sea- \\nWorld, an American amusement-park \\ngroup, and the Waldorf Astoria, a swish ho- \\ntel in New York.

The taste for long-lasting dried food \\nhas been a boon for Italy, a country in deep \\nrecession. Although Italians remain the \\nbiggest eaters of pasta worldwide, munch- \\ning through 23kg per head annually, the \\ncountry’s pasta-makers export 60% of their \\nproduction, mostly to Europe and Ameri- \\nca. While stuck at home far more cooks \\nmade plates of spaghetti, fettuccine and \\nfarfalle. According to ISTAT, the Italian sta- \\ntistics agency, exports of pasta increased by \\n30% in the first six months of the year com- \\npared with the same period in 2019. \\n\\nBarilla, the world’s biggest pasta-maker \\nwith sales of €3.6bn ($4.2bn) last year, \\nmust keep up with increased demand for \\nits core product. The 143-year-old family \\nfirm also owns Wasa, the world’s biggest \\nmaker of Swedish crisp bread, as well as a \\nhost of smaller snack brands. The com- \\npany’s high-tech headquarters in Parma \\noperated at close to capacity, producing \\n1,000 tonnes a day, throughout Italy’s \\nharsh lockdown in spring. Some other Ba- \\nrilla factories produced more pasta than  thanks to the additional safety measures. It \\ncontinued to make all of its 120 varieties. \\n\\nMaintaining supplies to Germany, one \\nof Barilla’s most important markets, even \\nrequired dedicated transport. Starting in \\nMarch the job of providing 22% of the pasta \\nand as much as 39% of the sauces eaten in \\nGermany meant dispatching two trains a \\nweek from Parma to Ulm, its main ware- \\nhouse in the country. Each train has 16 wag- \\nons transporting 490 tonnes of pasta, 60 \\ntonnes of sauces and 50 tonnes of pesto. \\nFrom June the trains ran three times a \\nweek; soon they might make four journeys. \\n\\nThe question for Barilla and other pas- \\nta-makers is whether the boom will outlast \\nthe pandemic. Luigi Cristiano Laurenza of \\nthe International Pasta Organisation is \\nconfident. Pasta consumption worldwide \\nincreased from 7m tonnes in 1999 to 16m \\ntonnes last year, even before it became a \\npandemic staple. Italy may have lost its ap- \\npetite a little in recent years but there is \\nroom for growth nearly everywhere else, in \\nparticular in Africa and Asia. Pasta is cheap, \\ntasty and versatile, says Mr Laurenza, mak- \\ning it especially attractive for cash- \\nStrapped families battered by a pandemic. \\n\\nIt is especially important for Barilla that \\nplates remain laden after a series of mis- \\nsteps. In 2002 it spent €1.8bn on a hostile \\ntakeover of Kamps, a German baker. It \\nturned out to be a costly mistake and in \\n2010 Barilla sold Kamps to a private-equity \\nfirm.

Crops moved \\nfrom cart to trailer to grain elevator. Nowa \\ndifferent kind of frenzy is taking hold. \\n\\nExports of American corn are poised to \\nreach a record of 67.3m tonnes for the mar- \\nketing year that began in September, ac- \\ncording to forecasts by the United States \\nDeparture of Agriculture (USDA) published \\non November 1oth. Demand for corn and \\nsoyabeans may push American stocks to \\ntheir lowest levels in seven years. By the \\ntime markets closed after the USDA's re- \\nport, the most actively traded corn and \\nsoyabean futures contracts had jumped to \\n$4.23 and $1.46 a bushel, respectively, with \\ncorn up by more than a third since early Au- \\ngust and soyabeans at their highest price in \\nover four years. They may rise higher still. \\n\\nThe surge in prices follows years of tur- \\nmoil for American farmers. Gripes include: \\nthe government's limit on the ethanol that \\ncan be blended in petrol; President Donald \\nTrump’s trade war with China; and the co- \\nronavirus, which depressed demand for oil \\nand therefore the biofuels mixed with it. \\n\\nPrices are climbing, in part, due to bad \\nweather. Wet conditions prompted some \\nAmerican farmers to forgo planting and \\ncollect government crop insurance in- \\nstead, notes Dan Basse of AgResource, a re- \\nsearch firm. Other farms suffered a dry Au- \\ngust. A derecho, or wind storm, blasted \\nacross the Midwest, with gusts of more \\nthan 100 miles per hour. Farmers else- \\nwhere have also experienced dismal condi- \\ntions. Usually fertile fields near the Black \\nSea are producing less corn than expected. \\nProduction in Ukraine is expected to fall by \\nmore than 20% compared with last year. \\n\\nMeanwhile demand from China has \\nsoared. In the first phase of Mr Trump’s \\ntrade deal, announced in January, China \\nagreed to buy an additional $200bn-worth \\nof American goods in 2020-21. Even with- \\nout the deal, Chinese demand for crops \\nwould probably have been robust. The \\ncountry is keen to expand its herds of hogs, \\ndecimated last year by African swine fever. \\nThat is raising demand for animal feed, \\nsuch as soyabeans. Anxiety about food se- \\ncurity means the government is refilling \\nstockpiles, too. The USDA expects Chinese \\nwheat imports to reach the highest level in \\n25 years, with total imports of corn and oth- \\ner Coarse grains setting a new record.  Little surprise, then, that export prices \\nfor American corn and soyabeans have \\nsailed above $220 and $470 a tonne, fe- \\nspectively, up by about 60% and 50% from \\ntheir 52-week lows.

Instead of entering their card \\ndetails at checkout, shoppers sign up to \\nKlarna’s app with their email and delivery \\naddress, and leave payment to be made in \\n14 or 30 days. Klarna pays the retailer in the \\nmeantime, bearing the risk that shoppers \\ndo not pay—something few other fintechs \\ndo—while charging the merchanta fee. \\n\\nCustomers are recognised when they \\nuse the app again, without needing to re- \\nenter their details.

       "  'LACK ENTREPRENEURS face a mighty \\nB struggle. African-Americans make up \\nabout 13% of the country’s population but \\nonly 2% of its business-owners. Their \\nfirms earn just 0.3% of total business \\nreceipts. Minority-owned businesses are \\nless profitable than comparable white- \\nowned firms, and have much higher rates \\nof failure. \\n\\nThe pandemic has hit these firms \\nespecially hard. Black-owned firms were \\nnearly twice as likely to shut down (by \\nAugust, over two-fifths had done so) \\nbecause of covid-19 as small firms over- \\nall. Emergency aid often did not reach \\nthem, in part because the Small Business \\nAdministration (SBA) did not direct \\nbanks to prioritise lending to such firms \\nas Congress intended. \\n\\nBlack entrepreneurs may now have \\ntwo reasons for cheer. One is top-down. \\nPast efforts by the federal government to \\nboost minority enterprises, a mix of loan \\nguarantees and quota schemes, have \\nfallen short. A recent analysis by McKin- \\nsey, aconsultancy, notes that although \\nthe SBA awarded some $2.3bn in federal \\ncontracts and backed about $210m in \\nloans for disadvantaged businesses in \\n2019, these schemes were “often imper- \\nfectly implemented”. \\n\\nThe incoming administration is \\npromising a big revamp. Joe Biden vows \\nto fund such firms to retain and rehire \\nworkers. After the pandemic, he wants to \\nexpand training, small-business in- \\ncubators and innovation hubs for “black \\nand brown entrepreneurs’. He also \\npromises to create a $30bn Small Busi- \\nness Opportunity Fund and to direct \\nadditional billions to minority firms. \\n\\nBut the playing field for black en- \\ntrepreneurs is not level, argues Dana \\nPeterson of the Conference Board, a \\nbusiness-research firm: access to credit \\nis “too often determined by the colour of \\nthe skin”. Black households have justa  tenth the assets of white ones. In addi- \\ntion, notes Katherine Klein of the Whar- \\nton School, they tend to have lower credit \\nscores. Black female entrepreneurs \\nreceive less than1% of all venture capital. \\n\\nSo even a tenfold increase in govern- \\nment funding would not solve the pro- \\nblem, argues Shelley Stewart of McKin- \\nsey, without bottom-up fixes too. That \\npoints to the second reason for cheer. In \\nthe wake of the Black Lives Matter prot- \\nests, corporate titans have made big \\ncommitments to boost black businesses. \\nJPMorgan Chase, a banking Goliath, says \\nit will pour $30bn over five years into \\nboosting black and Latino households \\nand businesses. Citi, another giant bank, \\nvows to take on “the racial wealth gap” \\nwith a $1bn pledge. \\n\\nSceptics worry this will prove mere \\n“tace-washing’” and that Mr Biden’s \\nefforts will get mired in red tape. But if \\nthey do take off, then black entrepre- \\nneurs might at last have a fighting \\nchance.

In September \\n2017 the then mayor of Airmont, a village 35 \\nmiles north of New York City, ordered the \\nfire inspector to the home of the mayor's \\nneighbours, an Orthodox Jewish family, to \\ndemand the family dismantle its sukkah. \\nAccording to a lawsuit filed by the federal \\ngovernment on December 2nd, the inspec- \\ntor, atthe mayor's direction, threatened the \\nfamily with immediate eviction unless the \\nsukkah was taken down. The family dis- \\nmantled it, despite the sukkah not violat-  ing any law. \\n\\nThis is one of several examples of al- \\nleged religious discrimination offered by \\nthe Department of Justice in its lawsuit \\nagainst Airmont. It asserts that the village \\nadopted discriminatory zoning codes and \\nland-use practices that violate federal law \\nand previous court judgments. Airmont \\nclaims the government is misinterpreting \\nthe village code. Yet this is the third time \\nthe federal government has filed a suit \\nagainst the village since it was incorporat- \\ned in 1991. A jury unanimously found in \\n1995 that the village’s first mayor, trustees \\nand zoning board had engaged in a con- \\nSpiracy to deprive Orthodox Jewish resi- \\ndents of their civil rights. One local said at \\nthe time: “the only reason we formed this \\nvillage is to keep those Jews...out of here.” \\n\\nFor much of its history, Airmont has \\nbeen under investigation, in litigation or \\nunder some sort of federal oversight. Its \\nvery creation, said Audrey Strauss, the act- \\ning attorney for New York's Southern Dis- \\ntrict, has its roots in animus against Ortho- \\ndox Jews. Its incorporation came about \\nbecause some locals wished to impose zon- \\ning restrictions to prevent the growing \\nultra-Orthodox Jewish population from \\nworshipping together at home. \\n\\nSince federal oversight expired in 2015, \\nthe latest lawsuit says, the village has dou- \\nbled down on discriminatory land-use \\nzoning. The government claims the village \\nunlawfully prevented the approval of an \\nOrthodox Jewish school’s expansion. Air- \\nmont implemented an 18-month village- \\nwide moratorium on development, which \\nthe lawsuit claims was targeted at the Or- \\nthodox Jewish community. When the mo- \\nratorium expired in 2018, the filing claims \\nland-use laws were amended and applied \\narbitrarily. Jewish homeowners were pro- \\nhibited from installing mikvahs, ritual \\nbaths used for religious observances. \\n\\nSeveral rabbis jointly filed suit in a fed- \\neral court in 2018. The case is pending.  Their lawyer, Keisha Russell of First Liber- \\nty, a not-for-profit firm that specialises in \\nreligious-discrimination cases, said one \\nclient spent $50,000 over two years trying \\nto get approval fora home extension. \\n\\nFor the past decade the ultra-Orthodox \\n(particularly the Hasidic) population has \\nbeen growing in towns in upstate New York \\nand neighbouring New Jersey.

She had refrained from reporting it out \\nof fear of retaliation.

Two months after she went missing, \\nher dismembered body was found buried \\nnear a river 20 miles from the base.

In response, the army removed or \\nsuspended 14 military leaders, including \\nthe major-general who headed Fort Hood at \\nthe time of Guillén’s disappearance. \\n\\nFort Hood has much higher rates of viol- \\nent sex crimes than other posts—75% high- \\ner than the army overall.

A small \\nfloating petri dish threatened to turn the \\nJapanese archipelago into a big one. In \\nretrospect, however, the early exposure \\ntaught the authorities lessons that have \\nhelped make Japan’s epidemic the mildest \\namong the world’s big economies, despite \\na recent surge in infections. In total 2,487 \\npeople have died of the coronavirus in Ja- \\npan, just over half the number in China and \\nfewer people than ona single day in Ameri- \\nca several times over the past week. Japan \\nhas suffered just 18 deaths per million peo- \\nple, a higher rate than in China, but by far \\nthe lowest in the G7, a club of big, industri- \\nalised democracies. (Germany comes in \\nsecond, at 239.) Most strikingly, Japan has \\nachieved this success without strict lock- \\ndowns or mass testing—the main weapons \\nin the battle against covid-19 elsewhere.  “From the beginning we did not aim at \\ncontainment,’ says Oshitani Hitoshi, a vi- \\nrologist who sits on an expert panel advis- \\ning the government. That would require \\nidentifying all possible cases, which is not \\nfeasible in a country of Japan’s size when \\nthe majority of infections produce mild or \\nno symptoms, argues Mr Oshitani: “Even if \\nyou test everyone once per week, you'll still \\nmiss some.” Japan performs the fewest \\ntests in the G7: an average of 270 a day for \\nevery million people, compared with 4,000  or so in America and Britain (see chart on \\nnext page). \\n\\nInstead, the government tried to apply \\nthe lessons of the Diamond Princess. After \\ntrained quarantine officers and nurses \\nwere infected aboard the ship, despite fol- \\nlowing protocols for viruses that spread \\nthrough droplets, Mr Oshitani’s team con- \\ncluded that the virus spread through the \\nair. AS early as March, Japanese officials be- \\ngan warning citizens to avoid the san-mitsu \\nor “3cs’: closed spaces, crowded places and \\nclose-contact settings.

       "  'S OF DECEMBER 10th, 564 South Kore- \\nA ans had died of covid-19. Roughly twice \\nthat number died by suicide every month \\nbetween January and September, the latest \\nmonth for which data are available. Half as \\nmany again made the attempt and were \\nsaved by the emergency services. \\n\\nHigh as these numbers are, they are \\nmercifully much lower than a decade ago, \\nwhen the suicide rate began to decline \\nSharply. Unfortunately, this happy trend \\nhas recently gone into reverse (see chart). \\nThe reversal is largely driven by women in \\ntheir teens, 20s and 30s. Between 2018 and \\n2019 the number of women in their 20s dy- \\ning by suicide rose by a quarter as the num- \\nber of men of the same age killing them- \\nselves stayed more or less constant. Data \\nfrom the first three-quarters of 2020 sug- \\ngest the suicide rate among young women \\nis rising still more. What is going on? \\n\\nIn most rich and middle-income coun- \\ntries suicide rates have been low and de- \\nclining in recent years. Though South Ko- \\nrea had begun to follow that trend, its \\npeople are more likely to kill themselves  than those of any other OECD country ex- \\ncept Lithuania. In 2019 there were 27 deaths \\nfrom suicide for every 100,000 people, al- \\nmost four times the number in Britain and \\nnearly twice as many as in America. In oth- \\ner respects, however, South Korea follows \\nglobal patterns: men and the elderly tend \\nto be at higher risk of suicide than women \\nand the young—making the increase in \\nSuicide among younger women all the \\nmore puzzling. \\n\\nSociologists tend to attribute the high \\noverall rate to social and economic upheav- \\nal. They argue that rapid economic devel- \\nOpment combined with a clash between \\ntraditional social expectations and the in- \\ndividualism of modern life have plunged \\nthe country into the sort of confusion that \\nEmile Durkheim, a 19th-century sociolo- \\ngist, called “anomie”, in which conflicting \\nsocial signals drive people to despair. That \\nsort of tension may be particularly acute \\nfor young women in contemporary South \\nKorea, says Timothy Kang of the University \\nof Saskatchewan in Canada. Having been \\nbrought up in the same competitive aca- \\ndemic environment as their male peers, \\nthey then encounter discrimination in the \\nworkplace, sexist standards of beauty and \\npressure to marry and have children. \\n\\nSouth Korean feminists argue that the \\npressure on women has been compounded \\nin recent years by the use of the internet to \\npropagate misogynistic views and to dis- \\nseminate illicitly obtained images of wom- \\nen, often from spycams hidden in toilets \\nand changing rooms. The country’s vocal \\nwomen’s movement has faced an intem- \\nperate backlash from men who object to its \\ndemands. “The relentlessness of the at- \\ntacks is a big problem for women,’ says \\nShin Min-joo, an activist who has received \\nplenty of online vitriol herself.

But their desti- \\nnation was no far-off promised land. It \\ntook less than four hours’ churning \\nthrough the wide, muddy estuary of the \\nMeghna River to reach Bhasan Char, an is- \\nland no bigger than a large city park, and so \\nfreshly formed it barely peeps above sur- \\nrounding tidal flats (see map). \\n\\nIt is here, improbably, that the govern- \\nment of Bangladesh has built a red-roofed, \\ngrid-patterned model town, intended to \\nhouse Rohingyas, an ethnic minority from \\nneighbouring Myanmar. Some 700,000 of \\nthem were chased into Bangladesh three \\nyears ago by the Burmese army and allied \\nmilitias in a horrifying bout of ethnic \\ncleansing. Bhasan Char can house about \\n100,000. The hosts present the new settle- \\nment, erected at a cost of $300m by the \\nBangladeshi navy, as a safe, sanitary and \\nhumane alternative to the teeming and \\nSqualid refugee camps that have mush- \\nroomed along the jungly border. \\n\\nYet while some of the island’s new resi- \\ndents say they are happy to have pukka \\nplumbing and cement floors, to many Ro- \\nhingyas the permanence and isolation of \\nthe model town promise not relief but the \\ninstitutionalisation of their misery.

Stories of violent \\ncrime and disease in the border camps have \\nspread, exacerbated by fears of covid-19 \\nand by the smuggling from Myanmar of \\narms and of drugs such as yaba, a cheap \\nform of methamphetamine that is ubiqui- \\ntous in Bangladesh. \\n\\nThe police, who in addition fear jihadist \\nradicalisation among refugees, have adopt- \\ned an increasingly harsh line in the camps. \\nOdhikar, a Bangladeshi human-rights \\ngroup, claims that since 2017 perhaps 100 \\nRohingya men have been killed during al-  leged “gunfights” with security forces, in \\nincidents that look more like executions. It \\nhas also built barbed-wire fences around \\nthe sprawling camps, the biggest of which \\nhouses nearly 600,000 people. \\n\\nRestrictions on the refugees are multi- \\nplying. Last year the government banned \\nthem from owning SIM cards and ordered \\nthe telecom authority to block mobile-in- \\nternet service in the camps. Though the \\nnetworks were restored a few months ago, \\nSIM cards are still forbidden. Rohingyas are \\nalso barred from holding bank accounts \\nand from paid work. Learning is almost as \\nhard as earning. Having resisted pressure \\nfrom NGOs to grant Rohingyas access to \\neducation for nearly three years, the gov- \\nernment had been on the verge of allowing \\nsome children to go school in April, when \\ncovid-19 intervened. \\n\\nThe move to Bhasan Char fits this pat- \\ntern, and the growing authoritarianism of \\nSheikh Hasina, who has been in power \\nwithout interruption since 2009. Trouble- \\nmakers can be more easily controlled on \\nthe island, and it would be useful to reduce \\nthe density of mainland camps. It is per- \\nhaps no coincidence that CCTV cameras \\nmonitor all the streets of Bhasan Char, or \\nthat the government has just created a new \\nbody to oversee refugee affairs. The 15-per- \\nson committee includes at least ten senior \\nsecurity officials, and no representatives of \\nthe Rohingyas. \\n\\nDespite deep misgivings among aid \\nworkers, there is some sympathy for Ban- \\ngladesh’s dilemma. If the relocation brings \\nmore attention to the Rohingyas’ plight, \\nthat might be a silver lining, speculates \\nJohn Quinley of Fortify Rights, an advocacy \\ngroup. “Bangladesh is right, calling out the \\ninternational community for not pushing \\nhard enough on Myanmar,’ he says.

What it and smaller charitable \\noutfits would most like is access to Bhasan \\nChar. So far, Bangladesh has not allowed \\nany regular visits, or any independent as- \\nsessment of the model town.

This year, the biggest gig it 1s pre- \\nparing for is a mass vaccination drive. If all \\ngoes to plan, in early January people will \\nstart streaming through its 75 booths that \\nare being set up for dishing out doses of \\nGermany's first supplies of covid-19 vac- \\ncines. Two of Berlin’s disused airports and \\nother venues are also being turned into \\nvaccination centres. The plan is to be ready \\nto vaccinate 20,000 Berliners a day over Six \\nweeks. This would account for 10% of the \\ncity’s residents, mainly the very old. \\n\\nGermany is rushing to set up more than \\n430 mass vaccination sites like these. It is \\nalso organising roaming vaccination \\nteams for care homes. In spring, vaccines \\nwill become available at doctors’ offices. \\nMobile teams will visit the infirm at home. \\n\\nOther European countries are preparing \\ntoo, though most are far behind Germany.  Italy plans to set up 300 covid-19 vaccina- \\ntion sites, starting in hospitals, along with \\nmobile units. The laggards are in eastern \\nEurope, where some countries have done \\nlittle more than set up task forces. \\n\\nThe starting shot for vaccination in the \\nEuropean Union will be fired on December \\n29th, when the European Medicines Agen- \\ncy (EMA), the Eu’s drug regulator, is expect- \\ned to decide on a covid-19 vaccine created \\nby Pfizer and BioNTech, which has already \\nbeen approved in Britain. On January 12th  the EMA will make the call on a second vac- \\ncine, by the American firm Moderna. Other \\ncovid-19 vaccines that are still in clinical \\ntrials will follow. By the look of things, at \\nsome point in 2021 most European coun- \\ntries may be using three or more covid-19 \\nvaccines simultaneously. \\n\\nA mix of vaccines will be needed. Global \\nsupplies of any one of them will be crimped \\nfor months. Sharp elbowing for vaccines \\nduring the 2009 H1N1 (swine flu) pandemic \\nleft some European countries unable to \\nprocure any. Wary of that, the European \\nCommission, the EU’s executive branch, \\nearlier this year organised joint pre-pur- \\nchase agreements on behalf of all 27 mem- \\nber states with the developers of several \\nprospective covid-19 vaccines (see chart \\noverleaf). These firms received hundreds \\nof millions of euros to set up production fa- \\ncilities, even before their vaccines are ap- \\nproved. In return, they are reserving large \\namounts of their first vials for the EU ata \\nset price. Approved vaccines will be distri- \\nbuted by the manufacturers to every EU \\ncountry in proportion to its population, as \\nbatches become available. \\n\\nAt the moment, the EU has been prom- \\nised up to 300m doses of Pfizer’s vaccine \\nand 160m doses of Moderna’s. Both require \\ntwo shots per course, so this should be \\nenough to cover 60% of all the EU's adults.  >» before spring, eve\"],\n",

The company is convivial, a \\nfire pit is blazing and two cheerful \\nbarmen are serving up endless glasses \\nof steaming Gluihwein, a Christmassy \\nconcoction of spices, citrus, sugar and \\n(usually bad) red wine. Under corona- \\nvirus restrictions the drinks are sup- \\nposed to be consumed elsewhere. But \\nhere, and across Germany's cities, that \\nrule is honoured mainly in the breach. \\nWarmly wrapped (but often unmasked) \\ncustomers clutching their grog gather \\nin small groups around tables or the \\nfire. And the most magical property of \\nGluhwein—it becomes undrinkable \\nonce it cools—ensures a steady stream \\nof refills. \\n\\nGerman bars and restaurants have \\nbeen closed to seated custom since \\nNovember 2nd. Setting up impromptu \\nGluhwein stands is one way for their \\nowners to replace a bit of lost income, \\nespecially as Germany's beloved Christ- \\nmas markets, where visitors usually \\nquaff gallons of the stuff, have also \\nbeen cancelled this year. There are \\ndrive-in Gliihwein stands in Bavaria and \\nGluhwein taxis in Lower Saxony. Some \\noutlets have organised “Gluhwein hap- \\npenings’ (although police had to break \\nup one in Heidelberg that attracted 200 \\npeople). And with most other forms of \\npublic drinking off-limits, this most \\ntraditional of libations has even ac- \\nquired a mild hipster edge. \\n\\nUnsurprisingly, all this jollity has \\ncaught the attention of the authorities. \\nSeveral cities and states have already \\nbanned open-air alcohol sales, and \\nmore seem certain to follow. “I know \\nhow much love has gone into setting up \\nthe Gluhwein stands,’ said Angela \\nMerkel, the chancellor, in an emotional \\nspeech to the Bundestag on December \\noth. “But this is not compatible with the \\nagreement we have made to take food \\naway to eat at home.” \\n\\nIn Germany, unlike in all other large \\nEuropean countries, the covid-19 case- \\nload is growing. Every day a fresh re- \\ncord number of deaths is recorded. Mrs \\nMerkel has endorsed an expert panel’s \\nrecommendation for a tougher lock- \\ndown, including extended school \\nholidays and business and shop clo- \\nsures. The experts offered no specific \\nviews on Gluhwein stands. But poli- \\nticians are surely mulling it over. \"],\n",

       "  'EARLY TWO months after the beheading \\nN of Samuel Paty, a schoolteacher who \\nhad shown pupils caricatures of the Pro- \\nphet Muhammad, the French government \\nhas unveiled a bill to clamp down on radi- \\ncal Islamism. This, at least, is the implicit \\naim of a draft law presented on December \\ngth. President Emmanuel Macron had \\npromised a bill to combat “Islamist sepa- \\nratism”. But, to pre-empt charges of stig- \\nmatising Islam, the final version has been \\nreframed as a text “to reinforce the princi- \\nples of the republic”. \\n\\nThe bill, declared Jean Castex, the prime \\nminister, is “not a text against religion, nor \\nagainst the Muslim religion”. Rather, he \\nSaid, itis “alaw of emancipation against re- \\nligious fundamentalism’, designed to rein- \\nforce such principles as laicité (secularism) \\nand gender equality. It was presented on \\nthe 115th anniversary of the adoption of a \\nlaw that separated religion and the state, \\nand first enshrined laicité. This strict \\nFrench version of secularism protects the \\nright both to believe and not to believe, as \\nwell as requiring religious neutrality in \\npublic life. \\n\\nThe new provisions, which will go \\nthrough parliament in early 2021, include \\ntight curbs on home-schooling (though \\nnot a ban, as originally promised). Parents \\nwill need to apply for permission if they \\nwish to teach their children at home, and to \\njustify it. The aim is to limit the use of \\nhome-schooling as a way to escape state \\noversight of radical Koranic teaching. Offi- \\nClals say they have uncovered such classes \\nin some neighbourhoods. \\n\\nThe bill will also make it easier for the \\ngovernment to inspect and shut places of \\nworship or associations that get public \\nsubsidies, if they do not respect “republi- \\ncan principles’, such as women’s equality. \\nA ban on state employees displaying “con- \\nSpicuous’ religious symbols, such as the \\nhijab or crucifix, will be extended from the \\nstate administration to any form of sub- \\ncontracted public service, such as job cen- \\ntres (although, with the existing exception \\nof schools, there is no such ban on those \\nusing public services, including universi- \\nties). Those who threaten officials with vio- \\nlence to secure concessions on religious \\ngrounds will face criminal penalties. \\n\\nFinally, doctors will be forbidden to is- \\nSue “virginity certificates” in order to pro- \\ntect women from pre-nuptial pressure. It \\nwill also be illegal to divulge or publish in-  formation that locates or identifies indi- \\nviduals in a way that puts them in danger, \\nwith stiffer penalties for identifying those \\nin positions of public authority. This mea- \\nSure is a direct response to the murder of \\nPaty, whose assassin identified him on so- \\ncial media before travelling to the school \\nwhere he taught. \\n\\nThe government argues that it needs \\nstronger powers in order to break up \\n“counter-societies’.

       "  \"HE SCANDALS that demolished Italy’s \\nj petene political order in the early \\n1990s brought a new generation into public \\nlife. Among them was Giorgia Meloni, who \\nat the age of 15 chose to join the youth \\nbranch of the Italian Social Movement \\n(MSI), the direct heirs of the Fascist Party \\nand its leader, Benito Mussolini, who ruled \\nItaly as a dictator until1943. \\n\\nToday Ms Meloni is riding high as a \\nleader herself. Her party, the Brothers of It- \\naly (FdI), has been the outstanding benefl- \\nciary of the covid-19 pandemic. Since late \\nFebruary, when it was already on a roll, the \\nparty has climbed steadily in the opinion \\npolls from around 12% to more than 16%. It \\nhas overtaken the anti-establishment Five \\nStar Movement, notionally the senior \\npartner in Giuseppe Conte's governing co- \\nalition. The FdI is “becoming firmly estab- \\nlished as Italy’s third party”, says Antonio \\nNoto of Noto Sondaggi, a polling firm. Nor \\nis it unthinkable that it may soon become \\nthe second. Some recent soundings have \\nput Ms Meloni’s party just four points be- \\nhind the centre-left Democratic Party, also  row over divvying out money from the EU's \\ncovid-19 recovery fund. Were it to fall, an \\nelection might produce a hard-right co- \\nalition government consisting of the FdI \\nand Matteo Salvini’s Northern League, \\nwhich still leads in the opinion polls, with \\naround 24%. \\n\\nThe rise in the Brothers’ popularity has \\nalmost exactly matched the fall in support \\nfor the League. Mr Salvini’s raucous show- \\nmanship has jarred with an electorate \\ngripped by fear of the virus and its eco- \\nnomic consequences. At the same time \\neven diehard nativists must question the \\nLeague’s leader’s continuing emphasis on \\nunauthorised immigration. So far this year \\n33,000 migrants have reached Italy, almost \\nthree times as many as in 2019 but a far cry \\nfrom the 181,000 who arrived in 2017. \\n\\nMs Meloni has conveyed a more nu- \\nanced and sober message, typical of her \\ncanny stewardship of amovement that two \\nyears ago won less than 5% of the vote at \\nthe last general election. Brothers of Italy \\nmay be a slightly odd name for a party led \\nby a woman, but it echoes the first line of \\nthe national anthem. Under Ms Meloni the \\nFdI has remained passionately nationalis- \\ntic and wedded to identity politics. Its mot- \\nto is “God, family and fatherland”. Top of its \\n15-point programme is greatly increased \\nsupport for families, to boost the birth rate \\nso Italy no longer needs immigrant work- \\ners. It is fiercely against giving automatic \\ncitizenship to children born in Italy of im- \\nmigrant parents, and would impose a naval \\nblockade to stop further arrivals. \\n\\nThe FdiI originated in 2012 as a splinter \\ngroup, made up of lawmakers from the \\nright of Silvio Berlusconi's catch-all con- \\nservative alliance, the People of Freedom. It \\nparticularly objected to the Tv mogul’s \\nhigh-handed leadership and his tolerance \\nof EU-imposed austerity. The Brothers’ pro- \\ngramme calls fora “rediscussion’ of all\"],\n",

       "  \"(€ 7NOUNTON US, hold us accountable and \\ntogether we willreinvent the way \\nbusinesses run.” Thus ends a recent letter \\nof support from 337 senior managers at SAP, \\na maker of business software, to Christian \\nKlein, their chief executive. In April Mr \\nKlein, then a stripling 39 years old, took \\nover as sole boss of Europe’s biggest tech- \\nnology firm, after running it for a few \\nmonths in tandem with Jennifer Morgan, \\nan American who used to helm saP’s busi- \\nness across the Atlantic. He needs all the \\nlove he can get, for SAP faces a challenge. \\n\\nMr Klein became CEO at the peak of co- \\nvid-19’s first wave. It had hurt SAP more \\nthan other tech firms: many of its biggest \\nclients, such as carmakers and energy com- \\npanies, were temporarily hit by the pan- \\ndemic. And it struckas more rivals were vy- \\ning for swathes of the business-software \\nmarket that the German giant used to rule. \\n\\nThen, in October, Mr Klein was hum- \\nbled when he presented changes to SAP’s \\nbusiness model that would depress mar- \\ngins in the short run and delay earlier rev- \\nenue and profit targets by two years. Com- \\nbined with lacklustre results for the third \\nquarter, the news shaved 22% off the firm’s \\nshare price, wiping out €35bn ($41bn) in \\nmarket value, the sharpest drop in 21 years \\nand almost unheard of for a firm of SAP’s \\nsize (see top chart). The purchase of almost \\n€250m in SAP shares the following day by \\nHasso Plattner, chairman of the superviso- \\nry board, who co-founded the company 48 \\nyears ago, did not reassure investors. \\n\\nTo regain their confidence Mr Klein \\nmust improve SAP's offering in the cloud, \\nand persuade more of its clients to move \\nthere. And he needs to do this while fend- \\ning off competition from firms such as Ora- \\ncle, Salesforce and Workday in America, \\nSAP’S biggest market. \\n\\nThe pandemic has softened demand for \\n“enterprise resource planning” (ERP) soft- \\nware, which firms use to manage their \\neveryday operations—and which has long \\nbeen SAP's forte. It has also prompted SAP’s \\nexisting clients, typically large or medium- \\nsized manufacturers, to rethink their ERP \\nprocesses. “I never had so many calls from \\nCEOS who wanted to talk about supply \\nchains,’ says Mr Klein. Retailers and manu- \\nfacturers asked SAP for tools to get more \\nvisibility of their suppliers. Critically, \\nmany of them demanded that ERP, which \\nhas traditionally resided on firms’ own \\nservers, be moved to the cloud instead.

       "  \"ARTELS EXIST to exert control. This year \\n\\nthe Organisation of the Petroleum Ex- \\nporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies have \\noccasionally seemed to prefer chaos. In \\nMarch Saudi Arabia and Russia began a \\nprice war just as covid-19 crushed demand, \\nakin to staging a fight atop a sinkhole. The \\ngroup agreed in April to slash output, but at \\na big meeting in December oil ministers \\ntook days longer than expected to decide \\ntheir next steps. The deal that emerged on \\nDecember 3rd was a relief to the market, as \\nthe group agreed to lift production in Janu- \\nary by a modest 500,000 barrels a day. \\n\\nBeyond January, however, OPEC and its \\nallies planned not to plan. Any changes to \\nproduction will be decided in monthly \\nmeetings. That is in part because it is diffi- \\ncult to predict oil’s recovery. It is also be- \\ncause the new year may mark the begin- \\nning of a new Strategy. \\n\\nItis a risky time to test new tactics. The \\noil market has begun a faltering comeback, \\nwith China refining a record14.1m barrels a \\nday in October and demand picking up in \\nIndia, too. Promising data on vaccines in \\nNovember helped buoy prices to their \\nhighest levels since March. But storage \\ntanks and ships are still swollen with some \\n3.8bn barrels of crude, nearly10% above the \\nlevel the same time last year, according to \\nKpler, a data firm. Brent crude, the interna- \\ntional benchmark, jumped to almost $50 \\non December ath, after the OPEC deal. By \\nDecember 8th prices had dipped again, as \\noptimism about Britain’s covid vaccine \\nroll-out was doused by uncertainty over \\nfurther lockdowns. \\n\\nYet it is plain that key oil producers are \\ntired of limiting output in ways that sup- \\nport rivals. Capping production to maxi- \\nmise prices makes sense in a world of infi- \\nnitely growing demand and _ scarce \\nresources. However oil demand may soon \\npeak, if it hasn't already, due to energy effi- \\nciency, electric cars and rising support for \\nclimate regulation. In that context, saving \\noil riches for later looks increasingly mis- \\nguided. Furthermore, competitors are hap- \\npy to free ride on OPEC's cuts. In 2016 the \\ncartel and its partners agreed to curb pro- \\nduction, providing a price support. That \\nboosted American frackers and depressed \\nOPEC’s market share, from 38% in 2016 to \\n34% last year. \\n\\nRussia's reluctance to support Ameri- \\ncan oilmen spurred the price war in March. \\nIn recent months the United Arab Emirates  (UAE), a Core OPEC producer, has aired its \\nown objections. Like Russia, the UAE has \\nworked to raise output (see chart). By 2030 \\nit hopes production capacity will climb by \\nnearly 25%, to5m barrels a day. To that end, \\nin November it said it had found 24bn bar- \\nrels-worth of oil tucked beneath Abu \\nDhabi. OPEC’s new deal reflects an eager- \\nness to ensure such efforts pay off. The car- \\ntel and its allies want to provide oil markets \\nwith some stability, but not enough to lift \\noutput significantly elsewhere and chomp \\nat their own market share. “You can't as- \"],\n",

(Nursing is a less de- \\nsirable career, and many Arab states rely on \\nnurses hired from abroad, a problem that is \\nnot unique to the Middle East.) \\n\\nOnce they graduate, though, many doc- \\ntors are eager to leave. Money is the most \\nobvious reason. A newly minted doctor in \\nEgypt can expect to earn just 2,000-2,500 \\npounds ($128-160) a month.

Infection rates among \\nLatinos in Chicago are double those of the \\ncity’s African-Americans and triple those \\nof whites. Of the city’s 15 worst-affected zip \\ncodes, 11are predominantly Latino. \\n\\nIn the few countries that collect and \\npublish such data, it is clear that covid-19 \\nhas hit ethnic minorities harder than \\nwhites. That is in part because the disease \\ndisproportionately affects those in jobs, \\nsuch as security guards and supermarket \\nStaff, where ethnic minorities are over-rep- \\nresented. But it is also because of racial dis- \\nparities in health. Doctors have long ar- \\ngued about the extent to which those \\ndisparities are the result of broader in- \\nequalities compared with other factors, \\nsuch as racism or biology. Covid-19 has \\nthrown those questions into stark relief.  Health outcomes differ for racial and \\nethnic groups. In Brazil people of colour \\ncan expect to live three years fewer than \\nwhite people. In America, where the black- \\nwhite health gap is at its narrowest ever, \\nblack men still live for four-and-a-half few- \\ner years than their white counterparts. Co- \\nvid-19 has magnified such differences. \\n\\nIt has hit ethnic minorities particularly \\nhard. In Britain all non-white groups (ex- \\ncept Chinese women) have been more like- \\nly to contract and to die from covid-19 than \\nwhites. Trends are similar in America. Dis- \\nparities are worst among the working-age \\npopulation. In America a 40-year-old His- \\npanic person is 12 times as likely to die asa \\n40-year-old white person, according to the \\nInstitute for Health Metrics and Evaluation \\nat the University of Washington.

Home \\nDepot’s quarterly revenues shot up by 23% \\ncompared with a year ago, to $33.5bn, keep- \\ning up the previous quarter’s pace.

This allows shoppers \\nto satisfy most of their retail needs in one \\nstore—particularly important in a pan- \\ndemic, when people are keen to limit their \\noutings. Walmart’s customers make fewer \\ntrips to the store but spend more whenever \\nthey do, he notes. \\n\\nThe star retailers’ biggest edge, though, \\ncomes from e-commerce.

More than 50 tech startups \\nhave floated this year, raising a total of \\n$26bn, according to Dealogic, a data pro- \\nvider. Many of Airbnb’s employees want to \\ncash in on the shares they have been \\nawarded before their right to do so expires. \\nAnd the firm needs money, on top of the \\n$2bn it raised earlier this year to tide it \\nover—hence its decision to scrap earlier \\nplans to list shares directly without drum- \\nming up fresh capital. \\n\\nMr Chesky has a good recovery story to \\ntell, too. In the painful second quarter the \\nnumber of nights booked on Airbnb fell to \\n28m, from 84m a year before. Gross book- \\nings collapsed by two-thirds, to $3.2bn. In \\nthe next three months, though, the num- \\nbers rebounded, to 62m and $8bn, mainly \\nthanks to what Mr Chesky calls “travel re- \\ndistribution”. Guests eschewed virus-hit \\nforeign cities, formerly Airbnb’s strong- \\nhold, for domestic and rural destinations. \\nStays less than 500 miles (800km) from \\nhome rose by more than 50% this summer. \\n\\nMr Chesky has also made Airbnb leaner. \\nBefore the pandemic the firm had sunk \\nmoney into new businesses, including \\nflights and a television studio, to pad rev- \\nenues ahead of the listing. Since then his \\nmotto has been “back to the roots”. He has \\nfired around 1,800 employees, a quarter of \\nthe workforce, shut down most of the new \\nactivities and radically cut online advertis-  ing (more than 90% of guests now book di- \\nrectly on Airbnb’s site). As a result, though \\nthe firm lost $916m in the first six months \\nof the year, it turned a net profit of $219m in \\nthe third quarter. \\n\\nCan Airbnb keep this up?

But time may be running \\nshort for golf in Singapore. The govern¬ \\nment is forcing some courses to shrink or \\nclose. Greens will give way to cranes; irons \\nto concrete and steel. \\n\\nGolf in the city-state has had powerful \\nchampions. Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore’s first \\nprime minister, loved it. (Golf was his \\n\"principal recreation and passion,” said his \\nson, Lee Hsien Yang, in 2015.) The royal and \\nancient game was once a symbol of middle- \\nclass aspiration, says Harvey Neo, a geogra¬ \\npher at the Lee Kuan Yew Centre for Inno¬ \\nvative Cities. During the 1990s and 2000s \\nSingaporeans were said to covet the \"scs\": \\ncash, car, condominium, credit card and  country-club membership. \\n\\nYet in 2013 the government, which owns \\nmost of the land in Singapore, announced \\nthat it would gradually reallocate much of \\nthe space taken up by golf courses to public \\nhousing and infrastructure. The ruling \\nparty, stung by its disappointing perfor¬ \\nmance at elections in 2011, felt it needed to \\nrespond to critics who said that it was out \\nof touch with ordinary Singaporeans and \\nwho argued that it had overcrowded the \\ntiny island by welcoming too many immi¬ \\ngrants. At the time of its announcement \\n2.1% of Singapore’s land was given over to \\ngreens and fairways. By 2030 the number of \\ncourses is expected to fall by 40% or so \\nfrom its peak in 2010. Closures are expected \\nto leave Singapore with one course for ev¬ \\nery 430,000 residents by 2040, down from \\none for every 250,000 three decades ago. \\n\\nMany Singaporeans shrug. The game’s \\ngrip on the national imagination is weak¬ \\nening. The number of people who play reg¬ \\nularly has not much changed for years, \\nthinks Jerome Ng, general manager of the \\nSingapore Golf Association. Some 55% of \\ngolf-club members are 55 or older. \"Young \\npeople are now into other sports,” says Lee \\nLee Langdale, who brokers country-club \\nmemberships. She says youngsters are put \\noff by the exorbitant cost. Some clubs \\ncharge hundreds of thousands of dollars \\njust to join. Garish clothes aren’t cheap, ei¬ \\nther. The game’s image has suffered. One \\nbanker says that he sometimes feels \"self- \\nconscious” admitting that he is a golfer. \\n\\nIt will be possible to play golf in Singa¬ \\npore for years to come. But the government \\nhas yet to renew the lease of any club be¬ \\nyond 2040, which worries enthusiasts. \\n\"We will lose everything,” says Ms Lang¬ \\ndale. Others are sanguine. \"The people we \\nused to play with are either dead or not \\nplaying any more,” says Aidan Wong, who \\nhas been swinging irons since he was 12. \\nWhen his club closes in 2021, he says, \"I will \\nprobably put my clubs away.\"'],\n",

But the pan¬ \\ndemic is just one of several issues that may \\nforce his hand. \\n\\nOn July 22nd Canada’s federal court  cited the Charter of Rights to throw out the \\n\"safe third-country” deal between Canada \\nand America on refugees. Since 2004 Cana¬ \\nda has been turning back arrivals at land- \\nborder crossings, saying they should have \\nsought refugee status in the United States \\nwhen they first landed there. But under Mr \\nTrump, America has been jailing those re¬ \\nturned by Canada, which the court said vio¬ \\nlates Canadian principles of justice. The \\ncourt gave the government until January to \\nmake changes (or appeal against the deci¬ \\nsion). That means negotiations will persist \\nthroughout the American presidential \\nelection campaign. \\n\\nIt will not be the only problem.

Mandela eventually saw \\nthe potential benefits of a cheap loan. But \\nthe anc rejected the offer. \\n\\nOpposition to the imf has remained a \\nshibboleth of the party. Yet on July 27th \\nSouth Africa said it had agreed to a $4.3bn \\nloan from the imf. The deal signed by \\nSouth Africa, one of 78 countries to have re¬ \\nceived covid-19-related help, is not a stan¬ \\ndard imf programme and thus does not \\nhave stringent conditions. But the need for \\nit nevertheless reflects the extent of the \\ncountry’s underlying economic problems. \\n\\nFor some of the anc’s self-styled com¬ \\nrades the worry about the imf has perhaps \\nbeen that it would make it harder for them \\nto loot state coffers. For others, including \\nThabo Mbeki, Mandela’s successor, an imf \\nloan would have meant an intolerable vio¬ \\nlation of sovereignty. \\n\\nDespite his doubts about the imf, Mr \\nMbeki pursued macroeconomic policies so \\northodox that a rabbi might have blessed \\nthem. Under Trevor Manuel, finance min¬ \\nister from 1996 to 2009, and Tito Mboweni, \\ngovernor of the reserve bank from 1999 to \\n2009, South Africa closed its budget deficit \\nand tamed inflation, which had averaged \\n14% in the 1980s. Though the anc’s patron¬ \\nage machine kept whirring, gdp grew by \\nmore than 5% a year from 2005 to 2007. \\n\\nThen came Jacob Zuma. Under his pres¬ \\nidency corruption thrived and public \\nspending ballooned. The negative effects \\nof rigid labour markets and affirmative ac¬ \\ntion intensified. Real gdp per person has \\nshrunk every year since 2015. The ratio of \\npublic debt to gdp rose from 26% in 2008 to \\n56% in 2018. As early as 2015, writers such \\nas R.W. Johnson warned that South Africa \\nwas heading for a bail-out. \\n\\nThis condition-light deal is not quite \\nthe Rubicon-crossing that some envisaged. \\nBut it is a toe in the water. In a letter to the \\nfund, Mr Mboweni, who in 2018 returned to \\nthe government as finance minister, and \\nLesetja Kganyago, the reserve bank’s cur¬ \\nrent governor, made several pledges, pri¬ \\nmarily relating to public finances. \\n\\nThey promised to cut the share of \\nspending that goes on public-sector wages \\nand to speed up structural reforms, for ex-   ample to state-owned enterprises such as \\nEslcom, the indebted electricity utility. \\nThey are open to a self-imposed \"debt ceil¬ \\ning” (public borrowing is projected to hit \\n87% of gdp in 2024 before declining).

Giuseppe Conte, the prime minister, \\nclaims it will be €209bn: €8ibn in grants \\nand €i27bn in loans.

Now  Rotherham is on its uppers. Local people \\nclaim that nearby shopping centres have \\nsucked away customers, and that others \\nhave been scared off by a sex-abuse scandal \\nand a series of far-right marches. The truth \\nis bleaker. The metropolis of which Rother¬ \\nham is part—which also includes Sheffield \\nand contains 1.2m people—is ailing. \\n\\nIn other countries, cities are often is¬ \\nlands of prosperity in poor regions. In the \\nformer East Germany, for example, Dres¬ \\nden and Leipzig are doing increasingly \\nwell.

In 2017 gdp per person in the Shef¬ \\nfield metropolitan area was just 70% of the \\nBritish average, according to the oecd— its \\nlowest share since the turn of the century. \\nOnly nine of Britain\\'s 40 metropolitan re¬ \\ngions that can be analysed are wealthier \\nthan the country.

Wealthy regions tend to contain \\nwealthy cities and towns; poor ones have \\nmostly poor cities and towns. The real gap \\nis between regions—or, to look at it another \\nway, between urban areas in poor regions \\nand urban areas in richer ones.

In early \\n2020 Bridgewater was head and shoulders \\nabove the rest, having made $58.5bn, net of \\nfees, for its clients since the firm’s incep¬ \\ntion in 1975. Mr Dalio is worth $i7bn, mak¬ \\ning him one of the richest people in the \\nworld. He stepped back from running the \\nfirm in 2017, but it has been shaped by his \\ndeep economic analysis, and his unortho¬ \\ndox management style, which he calls \"rad¬ \\nical transparency”. \\n\\nIn recent months, though, Bridgewa¬ \\nter’s performance has suffered, and ques¬ \\ntions have been raised about how transpar¬ \\nent its management really is. Start with its \\nperformance, which has struggled during \\nthe pandemic. The firm has two main types \\nof funds: \"pure alpha”, which makes active \\nbets based on its predictions for the econ¬ \\nomy, and \"all weather\", where holdings of \\nstocks and bonds are based on their under¬ \\nlying volatility. The latter strategy lost \\naround 7% in the first quarter. The pure-al- \\npha funds fared even worse. In mid-March \\nMr Dalio said they were down between 7% \\nand 21% since the start of the year. Accord¬ \\ning to reports, they subsequently recovered \\na bit, with losses pared by June, but were \\nstill significantly down on the year.  That is in contrast to the performance of \\nmany other \"macro” hedge funds. Accord¬ \\ning to Preqin, a data provider, these made \\nsmall positive returns, of 1.4% on average, \\nin the first half of the year. \\n\\nAs a result of its losses, and investors \\npulling their money out of its funds, \\nBridgewater’s assets under management \\nhave fallen—from $i63bn at the end of Feb¬ \\nruary to $i38bn at the end of April. \\n\\nThe all-weather funds have low, fixed \\nmanagement costs and no performance \\nfees. So it is the performance of pure alpha \\nthat largely determines Bridgewater’s over¬ \\nall financial health. That might explain \\nwhy the firm is retrenching. Even as many \\nbusinesses have laid off workers during the \\npandemic, few hedge funds are thought to \\nhave done so.

       "  \"N MAY 15TH the American government \\nO announced a Startling escalation in its \\nCampaign against Huawei, a Chinese com- \\npany which is the largest provider of tele- \\ncoms equipment in the world. American \\npoliticians and officials have long ex- \\npressed concerns that mobile networks \\nwhich rely on Huawei could allow snoop- \\ning and sabotage by China. In May 2019, cit- \\ning alleged violations of sanctions against \\nIran—charges Huawei denies—America \\nused powers designed to stop the transfer \\nof military technology to bar the company \\nfrom receiving American components vital \\nto the systems it sells. \\n\\nThose measures had loopholes: suppli- \\ners could keep on selling Huawei many \\ncomponents as long as they were made in \\nfacilities outside America. So this year \\nAmerica targeted the whole supply chain: \\nas of September it will be seeking to stop \\ncompanies around the world from using \\nsoftware or hardware that originally comes \\nfrom America to manufacture components  based on Huawel's designs. \\n\\nThe move was a serious blow to the \\ncompany. It may well have broughta sigh of \\nrelief in Britain. In January Boris Johnson, \\nthe British prime minister, had approved a \\nsubstantial if clearly demarcated role for \\nHuawel in Britain’s 5G telecoms infrastruc- \\nture. Its promise of a faster, more commo- \\ndious type of mobile broadband that allows \\ncompletely new internet applications and \\nmight prove necessary for self-driving cars \\nhas made 5G a touchstone for seers scrying \\nthe next big thing and for politicians who \\npay heed to them. Infrastructure spending \\nstamped with sucha hallmark of futurity is \\nright up Mr Johnson's alley. If Britain’s ex- \\nisting procedures for overseeing Huawei's \\nrole in telecoms infrastructure were ap- \\nplied, the government argued at the time, \\nHuawel's equipment could be used in “non \\ncore’ parts of the network, and Britain \\ncould get its 5G systems up and running \\nconsiderably sooner, and cheaper, than \\nwould otherwise be possible.  This decision was unpopular both with \\nthe White House and witha significant fac- \\ntion within Mr Johnson’s Conservative \\nParty, with the opposition happily backing \\nthe rebels. Dismay over China’s imposition \\nof new security laws on Hong Kong, in \\nbreach of the agreement under which the \\nterritory was handed back to it, heightened \\nfeelings further. America’s new salvo of \\nSanctions provided a plausible reason for \\nchanging course. The inevitable disloca- \\ntion to Huawei's supply chains, the govern- \\nment said, would make relying on the com- \\npany riskier. The new measures also meant \\nthat the vaunted system whereby British \\nspooks vetted Huawei equipment would \\nno longer be able to do its job: it would it- \\nSelf fall foul of the American sanctions. \\n\\nOn July 14th the government said it will \\nban mobile-network operators in Britain \\nfrom buying Huawei equipment for their \\n5G networks, and told them to remove \\nequipment already installed by 2027.

The \\nACLU reports that, overall, 14m students are \\nin schools with police but no counsellor, \\nnurse, psychologist or social worker. In \\nschool districts where budgets are tight, \\nfunding a police presence often takes pre- \\ncedence over other personnel. \\n\\nWhereas some schools are considering \\ndiminishing the role of police, others are \\ncontinuing and even expanding their pro- \\ngrammes.

Ear- \\nlier this year the governor of Kentucky \\nsigned a bill requiring an armed police offi- \\ncer in every school. \\n\\nOpponents of SROs argue that, among \\nother things, school policing dispropor- \\ntionately targets non-white students.

In the \\nmidst of a pandemic and the most fraught \\npolitical landscape since the 1960s, \\nthough, the feast of cases did not bring to- \\ntal victory for the five-member conserva- \\ntive majority. Instead, John Roberts, in his \\n15th year as chief justice, presided over a \\ncourt that broke leftand right about equally \\nin cases involving religion, abortion, civil \\nrights and presidential power. He also \\nmanaged to keep the proportion of 5-to-4 \\ndecisions down to around one-in-five— \\nmatching his tenure’s average. \\n\\nThe chief teamed up with the four more \\nliberal justices to record three significant \\nwins on the liberal side of the ledger. He \\nwrote the decision rejecting Mr Trump’s at- \\ntempt to rescind DACA, Barack Obama’s \\nprogramme protecting young immigrants \\nfrom deportation.

These moves to the left are remarkable \\nbut come with caveats. Mr Trump could try \\nto kill DACA again with a less obtuse justifi- \\ncation. The abortion ruling may invite new \\nregulations. LGBT workers might have little \\nrecourse against religiously inspired bias. \\nAnd Mr Trump will probably stand for re- \\nelection before Americans get to see his fi- \\nnances (if they ever see them atall). \\n\\nThere were overt victories on the right, \\ntoo.

On July 14th the “palace letters” were \\nat last made public, revealing secrets about \\none of Australia’s most explosive days: No- \\nvember 11th 1975, when the prime minister \\nof the day, Gough Whitlam, was dismissed \\nby the governor-general, Sir John Kerr. \\n\\nKerr asserted the power to do so as the \\nconstitutional representative of Queen \\nElizabeth, who is the head of state of Aus- \\ntralia and many other countries in the \\nCommonwealth, as well as Britain. No one \\nhad expected the largely vestigial power to \\nbe exercised. Outraged Australians—espe- \\ncially those of a republican bent—wanted \\nto know whether the queen had been \\nwarned of Kerr’s plans or had encouraged \\nhim. That mystery is now solved, but the \\nbroader question that the episode raised \\nabout Australia’s ties with its former colo- \\nnial power remains as vexing as ever. \\n\\nKerr's Official secretary deposited his \\ncorrespondence with Buckingham Palace \\nin the Australian archives in 1978, calling it \\n“personal and confidential”. The queen \\nwanted it kept secret until 2037. Jenny \\nHocking, an Australian historian, em- \\nbarked on a legal battle four years ago to \\nhave the letters made public. On May 29th \\nthe High Court agreed that they were public \\nrecords and ordered their release. \\n\\nItturns out that Kerr never informed the \\nqueen directly of his plan. But he did have  extensive correspondence with Sir Martin \\nCharteris, her private secretary at the time, \\nwho showed Kerr's letters to the queen and \\nreplied on her behalf. The two men dis- \\ncussed “reserve powers”, an unwritten and \\ndisputed form of viceregal authority that \\nKerr used to sack Whitlam. A week before \\nhe did so, Charteris, who later admitted he \\nwas “not very well versed in the Australian \\nconstitution’, assured Kerr that such pow- \\ners existed and could be used “at the very \\nend when there is demonstrably no other \\ncourse’. Buckingham Palace says the let- \\nters confirm that neither the queen nor the \\nroyal household “had any part to play in \\nKerr's decision to dismiss Whitlam”. Ms \\nHocking disagrees. To her, they reveal \\n“clearly and unavoidably” that the palace \\n“did play a part”. \\n\\nFor almost 50 years, the dismissal has \\nbeen a reference point for debate about the \\nrole of Britain and its monarchy in Austra- \\nlian affairs.

At any rate, they did not ap- \\npear grateful for stimulus packages worth \\nalmost 20% of GDP that Mr Heng, as finance \\nminister, shepherded through Parliament. \\n\\nVoters also seemed unmoved by the \\nPAP’s system of carrots and sticks regarding \\npublic amenities.

The prohibition is a boon \\nfor pineapple growers such as Mr De Bruin. \\nThe fruit is good for home-brewing, he ex- \\nplains; pineapple beer requires little sugar \\nor yeast and is ready quickly. “Prices have \\nshot through the roof.” \\n\\nThe ban is the second of the year. Zweli \\nMkhize, the health minister, says that ad- \\nmissions to trauma wards fell by 60-70% in \\nApril and May, when alcohol was prohibit- \\ned during an initial, stringent lockdown. \\nWhen restrictions were eased in June, ad- \\nmissions rose. The Medical Research \\nCouncil reckons that an eight-week ban \\ncould allow for nearly 13,000 covid-19 pa- \\ntients to be treated in intensive-care units. \\n\\nThese data reflect what Dr Mkhize calls \\nSouth Africa's “unhealthy relationship” \\nwith alcohol. Less than a third of South Af- \\nrican adults drink the stuff, but those who \\ndo quaff about twice as much each as the \\naverage boozer elsewhere. \\n\\nHistory partly explains these patterns. \\nUnder apartheid black miners and factory \\nworkers lived in single-sex hostels away \\nfrom their families. Drinking passed the \\ntime. In the winelands mixed-race workers \\nwere given “dops’ (alcohol) by farmers. Yet \\nhistory also shows how illicit trades thrive \\nunder prohibition. Between 1928 and 1961 \\nblack people were not allowed to buy Euro- \\npean wine or spirits. This, says Paul Nugent \\nof the University of Edinburgh, encouraged \\nthe rise of home-brewing and shebeens, \\nthe drinking dens that thrive in townships. \\n\\nThe new ban has supporters. As in the \\n1920s these include women who fear drun- \\nken male violence. But it would be better \\nreceived if the state were not so arbitrary. \\nCigarette sales are also illegal.

The first ban \\nput 350 wine producers out of business. \\nTax collectors reckon they lost out on1.3bn \\nrand ($78m) in alcohol levies in April alone. \\nRestricting sales takes away a source of \\npleasure, especially for those who cannot \\nafford to bulk-buy pinotage.

Because China’s workers are 4.7 \\ntimes as numerous as America’s, they need \\nbe only a fraction as productive to surpass \\nAmerica’s output. No fewer than 53 coun- \\ntries would already have a bigger GpP than \\nAmerica if they were as populous as China. \\n\\nIn 2019 China’s workers produced over \\nggtrn yuan-worth of goods and services. \\nAmerica’s produced $21.4trn-worth. Since \\nit took about 6.9 yuan to buy a dollar last \\nyear, China’s GDP was worth only $14trn \\nwhen converted into dollars at market \\nrates. That was still well short of America’s. \\n\\nBut 6.9 yuan stretches further in China \\nthan a dollar goes in America. One example \\nis the McDonald's Big Mac. It costs about \\n21.70 yuan in China and $5.71 in America, \\naccording to prices collected by The Econo- \\nmist. By that measure, it takes only 3.8 yuan \\nto buy as much as a dollar. But if that is the \\ncase, then 99trn yuan can buy as much as \\n$26trn, and China’s economy is already \\nconsiderably bigger than America’s. \\n\\nMotivated by this logic, The Economist \\nhas compared the price of Big Macs around \\nthe world since 1986. The result is a rough \\ngauge of the purchasing power of curren- \\ncies. It suggests that many currencies are \\nundervalued, relative to the dollar, on the \\nforeign-exchange markets (see chart). The \\nSwiss franc and the Lebanese pound are \\novervalued. Lebanon's currency was un- \\ndervalued until inflation took off late last \\nyear, raising local prices even as the pound \\nremained pegged to the dollar. The Big Mac \\nalone jumped 38% in price. \\n\\nEvery few years the World Bank em- \\nbarks on a vastly more systematic effort to \\ngauge purchasing power by comparing \\nthousands of prices across the world. The \\nresults can be startling. Its survey of prices \\nin 2011, released six years ago, showed that \\nChina was cheaper than _ previously \\nthought and its economy was therefore \\nmuch larger. Based on these estimates, the \\nIMF calculated that its GDP overtook Amer- \\nica’s in 2014 and was 27% bigger in 2019. \\n\\nMany observers, however, greeted these \\nestimates with scepticism.

Their work has fed into \\nthe Inclusive Wealth project, initiated by \\nthe United Nations, directed by Managi \\nShunsuke of Kyushu University and ad- \\nvised by Sir Partha Dasgupta of Cambridge. \\nThey estimate the world’s natural capital \\namounted to over $91trn in 2014, or over \\n$13,000 per person.

After just three games, the Miami \\nMarlins’ games were temporarily sus- \\npended after 18 players—more than half \\nthe roster—and some backroom staff \\ntested positive for covid-19. Five games \\ninto its season the St Louis Cardinals \\nwere hit by an unrelated outbreak. Seven \\nplayers and six team staffers tested posi- \\ntive.

UBI \\nwas the centrepiece of Mr Yang’s run for the \\nDemocratic presidential nomination, in \\nwhich he advocated a guaranteed income \\nof $1,000 a month, a “Freedom Dividend”, \\nas he called it, for every American adult, re- \\ngardless of their financial circumstances. \\n\\nThere are two big hurdles to introduc- \\ning UBI in America. One is building sup- \\nport for something that sounds, to many, \\nalarmingly socialist. The other is working \\nout how to pay for it. Mr Yang’s campaign \\nfor the Democratic nomination may have \\nfailed. But on one of these points he has \\nbeen wildly successful. A recent Stanford \\nstudy showed that people are warming to \\nthe UBI idea. In April 88% of liberals backed \\nit, while support among conservatives rose \\nfrom 28% before covid-19 to 45%. Universal \\nbenefits can be easier for politicians to sell, \\nbecause they are less vulnerable to the ra- \\ncial politics that have undermined support \\nfor welfare spending in the past. \\n\\nDreams of a UBI have a peculiar history \\nin America. In1967 a coalition of welfare re- \\ncipients, led by African-American women, \\ndemanded “decent income as aright”. Mar- \\ntin Luther King wrote about it in his final \\nbook. At the other end of the political spec- \\ntrum, Donald Rumsfeld and Dick Cheney \\ndrew up a guaranteed minimum-income \\nproposal for President Richard Nixon. Mil- \\nton Friedman and Friedrich Hayek, be- \\nloved of libertarians, were enthusiasts too. \\n\\nMore recently, UBI has been taken up by \\ntechnologists who believe that software \\nwill leave a large number of Americans job- \\nless, leading to social unrest. It has also \\nbeen promoted by some of the organisa- \\ntions which make up the Black Lives Matter \\nmovement, who see it as a way to mend ra- \\ncial disparities in wealth. \\n\\nMr Yang points out that the approval \\nrating for UBI was only about 25% when he \\nbegan his presidential run, but by the time \\nhe ended it, in February, it was 66%. “The \\nenergy around universal basic income has \\nskyrocketed, and it’s going to remain ele- \\nvated until a bill passes,” says Mr Yang, who \\nbelieves the job losses caused by covid-19  will not quickly be reversed. In June Jack \\nDorsey, Twitter's boss, gave Mr Yang’s orga- \\nnisation $5m to build the case for UBI. \\n\\nFunding a generous UBI has always \\nseemed impossible.

The news came just as the country re- \\ncorded 166 covid-19 deaths, a daily record. \\n“The challenge is a path out of pandemic \\nand deep recession,’ said the adviser. \\n\\nThe summing-up is accurate. Mr Fer- \\nnandez, a Peronist who became president \\nin December, had appeared to be ona colli- \\nsion course with holders of $65bn-worth of \\nforeign-law bonds.

Ar- \\ngentina, now on its ninth debt default, \\nlooked set for yet another legal battle with  creditors, which would have weakened the \\npeso, quickened inflation and prolonged \\nits exile from international credit markets. \\n\\nThe government's agreement with the \\nmain holders of the debt has probably \\naverted that danger. It is offering new \\nbonds worth almost 55% of the face value \\nof the ones they own, up from an original \\nproposal of 38%. It will start to pay a bit ear- \\nlier than it had first proposed (interest due \\nevery March and September will instead be \\npaid every January and July). It has also \\nagreed to make collective-action clauses, \\nwhich allow a supermajority of creditors to \\nforce others to agree to a debt restructur- \\ning, more favourable to investors by mak-  ing it harder for Argentina to make a Sepa- \\nrate peace with a subset of creditors, then \\nturn on the rest. Argentina will now have to \\nrenegotiate its $44bn debt to the IMF. \\n\\nThe agreement with creditors is “great \\nnews’, says Federico Sturzenegger, a for- \\nmer head of the Central Bank who has been \\na critic of Mr Fernandez.

And even though the mosque was de- \\nstroyed in 1992 after a BJP rally at its gates \\ndescended into a riot, the courts dithered \\nfor decades about what should become of \\nthe ruins, leaving the party with a perenni- \\nal campaign issue. The fact that the demolli-  tion sparked nationwide violence that \\nclaimed over 2,000 lives only helped the \\nBJP, by heightening sectarian tensions. \\nThe episode also accelerated the career \\nof Mr Modi, whose efficiency and drive \\nearned the admiration of the BjP’s top lead- \\ners. He received a further boost when a fire \\naboard a train in his home state of Gujarat \\nkilled 59 Hindu pilgrims returning from \\nAyodhya. Local Muslims were accused of \\narson, and in the ensuing pogrom at least \\n1,000 people, the vast majority of them \\nMuslim, died. Although the courts have \\ncleared Mr Modi, Gujarat’s chief minister at \\nthe time, of complicity in the violence, he \\nhas been lauded by Hindu extremists ever  since for putting Muslims in their place. \\nOn August 5th Mr Modi, now prime \\nminister, returned to Ayodhya—for the \\nfirst time since 1991, according to some re- \\nports. He was there to lay the foundation \\nstone of the temple for which he and his \\nparty have campaigned for his entire ca- \\nreer, and for which the Supreme Court had \\nat last cleared a path in November. Mr Modi \\n(pictured) prayed and chanted in religious \\ngarb and a medical facemask alongside \\nYogi Adityanath, a firebrand Hindu cleric \\nwhom he elevated to chief minister of Uttar \\nPradesh, and Mohan Bhagwat, the head of \\nthe Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, a \\ngoose-stepping Hindu paramilitary group \\nwith perhaps 5m members. Then he helped \\nmanoeuvre a 40kg silver brick into place \\nbefore declaring, “The wait of centuries is \\nending.” He did not mention, much less la- \\nment, the vandalism that had cleared the \\nway for the temple’s construction. \\nAlthough India is officially a secular re- \\npublic, the barrier between faith and state \\nhas never been absolute. The state has even \\nabetted the construction of a Hindu temple \\non a site occupied by a mosque before—in \\nthe 1950s, at Somnath, the starting point of \\nthe Ram Rath Yatra.

It is home to over 12,000 companies \\ninvolved in creating it. They employ one in \\neight of the city’s workers. By one official \\ncalculation, no other sector contributes \\nmore to Changsha’s wealth. In 2017 (the \\nmost recent year for which figures are \\navailable) creative and cultural industries \\ngenerated 9% of the city’s GDP—a propor-  tion twice as high as their contribution to \\nnational output. At their heart in Hunan is \\na broadcaster with a knack for cranking out \\nprogrammes that are watched throughout \\nChina.

It accounts \\nfor 53% of the confirmed cases and 43% of \\ndeaths from covid-19 in Africa. But that \\ndoes not mean the rest of the continent is \\nbeing spared. Instead it reflects a lack of \\ndata in most other countries—and how \\ntheir peaks may be yet to come. \\n\\nAs of August 5th the Africa Centres for \\nDisease Control and Prevention, a public- \\nhealth body, had recorded 992,710 cases in \\nAfrica. It took about five months for the \\ncontinent to reach 500,000 cases and an- \\nother month to reach close toim. The com- \\npound daily growth rate of new cases over \\nthe past two weeks was higher in sub-Saha- \\nran Africa than in other regions. In reality \\nthe millionth African contracted covid-19 \\nmany weeks ago. \\n\\nThe full extent of the undercount is un- \\nknown. The share of tests that come up \\npositive is below 5% in only a few coun- \\ntries, suggesting widespread underreport- \\ning elsewhere. Low test-positivity-rates are \\nfound in states with relatively efficient \\ngovernments, such as Botswana; countries \\nwith feared security forces, like Uganda; \\nand those that have both, such as Rwanda. \\n\\nElsewhere the shares are much higher. \\nIn most of the countries where the Interna- \\ntional Rescue Committee works the rates \\nare in double digits—for instance Somalia \\n(17%, as of July 30th), Congo (20%), South \\nSudan (19%), Ivory Coast (16%) and the Cen- \\ntral African Republic (16%). Relative to its \\npopulation, Britain has done 600 times \\nmore tests than have the African countries \\nwhere the IRC works. \\n\\nAnother hint of underreporting is \\nfound in the number of cases among Afri- \\nca’s elites, who are more likely to get tests. \\nAt least three of South Sudan’s five vice- \\npresidents have had covid-19.

Under pressure from \\ntrade unions and business, Mr Fernandez \\nhas allowed organisations in 11 sectors, in- \\ncluding export industries and refuges for \\nvictims of domestic violence, to reopen. \\nBut he is likely to rule out a quick return to \\nnormality like that advocated by Brazil's \\npresident, Jair Bolsonaro, who makes light \\nof covid-19. Mr Fernandez knows that the \\npandemic is more merciless than Argenti- \\nna’s creditors. &  N 2010 the Netherlands’ Centre for the \\nPromotion of Imports from developing \\ncountries, which is financed by the govern- \\nment, sent Cees van Casteren to Bolivia. \\nHis mission was to help Bolivia’s vintners \\nbreak into Europe. It was a tough assign- \\nment. Back then, Bolivia’s main winemak- \\ners—Kohlberg, Campos de Solana and \\nAranjuez, all family-owned—competed \\nfiercely to sell cheap wine to a tiny protect- \\ned domestic market. The intoxicating ex- \\nport for which Bolivia is famous is cocaine. \\nThe idea that Bolivia might aspire to \\nbottle something better is not silly. Spanish \\npriests made wines there in the 16th cen- \\ntury. The modern industry started in the \\n1960s, when the Kohlbergs brought vines \\nfrom Europe to make wine to relieve a fam- \\nily member’s heart condition. \\nBolivia's vineyards in the Andean re- \\ngion of Tarija are among the world’s high-  est, at 2,000 metres (6,500 feet) above sea \\nlevel. Intense sunshine gives grapes’ skins \\nmore tannin and wide daily temperature \\nSwings increase the acidity of their juice. \\nThat makes tannats, malbecs and cabernet \\nSauvignons “fresh”, and “spicier” than low- \\ner-altitude wines, says Mr van Casteren, \\none of 394 “masters of wine”. \\n\\nBut putting them on European tables \\nhas not been easy. The first step was to \\nbring the feuding families together to agree \\non how to spend the Dutch aid and to come \\nup with a shared brand for Bolivian wines. \\n“They wouldn't even sit together at the \\nSame table,’ says Mr van Casteren. No one \\nshowed up to the first meeting he called. \\nEventually, they forged friendships on \\ntours of European vineyards. \\n\\nBolivian vintners cannot compete \\nagainst Argentines and Chileans as mass  In Investors \\n\\nIn Optimism \\n\\nIn Guidance \\n\\nIn Security \\n\\nIn Kindness \\n\\nIn Service \\n\\nIn Clarity \\n\\nIn Your Needs \\n\\nIn Your Satisfaction \\nIn Your Llomorrow  » planting a hectare of vines is 20% higher \\nthan in Mendoza, Argentina’s top wine- \\nmaking region, says Luis Pablo Granier, a \\nco-owner of Campos de Solana. Bolivian \\nvineyards have one-third of Mendoza’s \\nyield per hectare. Bolivia is landlocked, so \\nfreight costs are high. An overvalued cur- \\nrency makes the Bolivians less competi- \\ntive. So the families agreed to make better \\nwines. Prodded by Mr van Casteren, they \\nbought oak casks for ageing and upgraded \\nirrigation systems.

The intention, it said, was to \\nprevent “drink parties” at which the virus \\nmight spread and to reduce unnecessary \\nshopping trips. Small wonder: when the \\ngovernment first began introducing \\ncountrywide measures to slow the \\nspread of the disease, “wine shops” — \\nubiquitous small stores selling mainly \\nbeer and liquor—were mobbed (social \\ndistancing be damned) by customers \\nfrantically stocking up. \\n\\nSince then, booze has been hard to  obtain. Supermarkets offer deliveries, \\nbut few have a licence to sell alcohol. For \\natime, enterprising distributors ar- \\nranged deliveries of liquor, too, until the \\nauthorities made it clear that these were \\nbanned. A black market has sprung up, \\nbut sellers are hard to find and prices are \\nprohibitive. A bottle of “gal”, which is \\ndistilled from coconut-palm sap, goes for \\nalmost three times its normal price of \\nabout1,850 rupees ($9.75). \\n\\nThe obvious, albeit illegal, solution is \\nhome-brewing. Sri Lankans desperate for \\na tipple are mixing everything from beets \\nto pineapple with sugar, water and yeast, \\nand leaving the cocktail to ferment. The \\nresult can be cloudy, fizzy and sickly \\nsweet, but is at least mildly alcoholic. \\nThe more ambitious are trying to distil \\nthese brews into something stronger. \\nOne home-distiller describes fending off \\ninquiries from the man who delivers \\ncooking-gas canisters, who wants to \\nknow why his consumption has shot up. \\nThe next wave of hospital admissions, a \\ncommon joke runs, won't be victims of \\nthe virus, but of alcohol poisoning. \\n\\nThe police say they have uncovered \\n18,000 instances of illicit alcohol produc- \\ntion.

Even though the \\nscene was tragic, the surroundings were \\nmuch more pleasant than usual. In the cur- \\nrent dry season the riveris normally a fetid, \\ninky sewer. At the moment, however, it is \\nmiraculously clean. The closure of indus- \\ntries upstream, says the city’s water board, \\nmeans that for the first time in years the Ya- \\nmuna has enough oxygen to sustain life. \\n\\nWith more than 20,000 confirmed \\ncases and close to 700 dead, India is not yet \\none of the worst-hit countries. That dis- \\ntinction may still come, but the strict lock- \\ndown imposed since March 25th has \\nSlowed the spread of the virus markedly. \\nWithout it, some half a million Indians \\nwould now have the disease, reckons Jaya- \\nprakash Muliyil, an epidemiologist. By \\nmid-June, he surmises, covid-19 could have \\nkilled 2.5m people, about as many as would \\nnormally die from all causes over the per- \\niod. From doubling every three days, the \\nnumber of active cases is now doubling ev- \\nery eight. V.K. Paul, a government health \\nexpert, says that by May that rate should \\ndrop to every ten days. “We have bought \\ntime,’ Says a weary doctor in Mumbai, In- \\ndia’s hardest-hit city, describing efforts to \\nbuild up medical capacity. “We started with \\na broken bicycle, but we’ve got a wobbly \\nmotorbike going now, and might even bang \\ntogether a workable auto-rickshaw.” \\n\\nIt is not just to the potential victims of \\ncovid-19 that the lockdown has brought a \\nreprieve. In ordinary times, air pollution \\nkills at least 1.2m Indians a year. That is \\nmore than it kills in China, where research \\nby Marshall Burke, an environmental sci- \\nentist at Stanford University, suggests that \\ncleaner air during its own covid-19 lock- \\ndown may have saved 17 times more lives \\nthan the (official) number lost to the virus. \\nAnother study in China, measuring the ef- \\nfect on health of Beijing’s curbs on pollu- \\ntion during the 2008 Olympics, reckons \\nthat every 10% fall in pollution led to an 8% \\ndrop in deaths from all causes. The plunge \\nin air pollution in India has been no less \\ndramatic. At one monitoring station in \\ncentral Delhi, levels of nitrogen dioxide are \\n85% lower than in recent years. NASA, \\nAmerica’s space agency, says that across In- \\ndia levels of suspended aerosols are lower \\nthan at any time since it started measuring  them twenty years ago. \\n\\nThen again, the lockdown has had a \\ncrippling effect on many Indians’ liveli- \\nhoods. Unemployment has shot up shock- \\ningly, from 8% at the beginning of March to \\n26% in mid-April, according to the Centre \\nfor Monitoring the Indian Economy, a re- \\nSearch group. Nomura, an investment \\nbank, has reduced its expectations for GDP \\ngrowth fromalimp4.5% toa painful-0.5%. \\nOne estimate suggests an extra 100m peo- \\nple could fall below the World Bank’s pov- \\nerty line of $3.20 a day.

A major goal \\nof the reshuffle on April 22nd, she said, was \\nto “help Hong Kong get out of this difficult \\nsituation as soon as possible”. \\n\\nShe was referring to the economic crisis \\ncaused by covid-19. But Hong Kongers have \\npolitical worries, too. In recent days several \\nprominent democrats have been arrested, \\nand the central government has rejected \\nwhat had been widely regarded as a consti- \\ntutional restraint on its behaviour in Hong \\nKong. Political turmoil—which had ap- \\npeared to ebb in recent weeks—looks set to \\nflare anew. The changes to Ms Lam’s team \\nwill not reduce tensions. \\n\\nSince June 2019, when protests erupted \\nover a since-abandoned extradition law, \\nmore than 7,000 people have been arrested \\nfor taking part in the riots and unautho- \\nrised demonstrations that roiled the terri- \\ntory for the rest of the year. But no \\nround-up by the police has caused as much  Shock as the one on April 18th, during \\nwhich 15 of Hong Kong’s best-known cam- \\npaigners for democracy were charged with \\npromoting, organising and joining illegal \\ndemonstrations. Among them were Martin \\nLee, a barrister and former legislator who is \\noften called the “father” of Hong Kong’s \\npro-democracy movement, and Jimmy Lai \\n(pictured), the publisher of Apple Daily, a \\npopular pro-democracy tabloid. \\n\\nLast year’s protests mainly involved \\nyoung people acting without any formal \\nleadership. Some of them turned to vio- \\nlence, throwing petrol bombs and vandal- \\nising property. Mr Lee, however, is 81anda \\nmoderate who, like many veteran demo- \\ncrats, largely remained aloof from the un- \\nrest—sympathising with the protesters’ \\nmotives but not encouraging their con-  frontations with the police. If peaceful old \\nmen like him are being arrested, many \\nHong Kongers worry, the Communist Party \\nmust be pressing the territory’s govern- \\nment to cast the net wider. Mr Lee has been \\nan outspoken critic of the party since long \\nbefore the British withdrawal in 1997. \\n\\nAfter being freed on bail, Mr Lee said he \\nwas proud. “Over the months and years, \\nI’ve felt bad to see so many outstanding \\nyoungsters being arrested and prosecuted, \\nbutI was not charged,’ he told reporters.

These extra chopsticks—often longer  than usual and specially labelled or col- \\noured—are not to be placed in the mouth. \\nThey are common in other chopstick-using \\nsocieties, such as Japan and Taiwan, but \\nSwapping from one set of chopsticks to an- \\nother is often considered a nuisance in \\nmainland China. It is rarely done except in \\nvery formal settings. \\n\\nIn Hubei, the province worst affected by \\ncovid-19, schools are giving online lessons \\non how to be a good “communal-chop- \\nsticks pioneer’. A shopping mall in Shang- \\nhai is offering free parking to customers \\nwho agree to use them at its restaurants. \\nStaff use red ink to stamp the bills of com- \\npliant customers, who redeem the perk on \\ntheir way out. The city government in Bei- \\njing is drafting new rules on “civilised” be- \\nhaviour. They require using separate chop- \\nsticks for serving (the penalty, if any, for \\nviolators has not been specified).

But the situa- \\ntion is the same in other Gulf states. The \\nSaudi health ministry said on April 5th that \\n53% of confirmed cases involved foreign- \\ners. The share is probably higher now: mi- \\ngrants account for about four in five recent \\ncases.

In New \\nYork and Los Angeles, reformers such as \\nRudy Giuliani, who was New York’s mayor \\nin the 1990s, and Bill Bratton-chief of po- \\nlice in both cities at different times-forced \\ncops out of their cars, adopted data-driven \\npolicing and tried to make public spaces \\nfeel safe.

His successor, Cory \\nBooker, now a Democratic senator, did \\nmuch to attract investment into down- \\ntown Newark, and managed for a short \\ntime to reduce crime and overhaul the po- \\nlice department; but the money ran out, \\nand he later had to cut the force sharply. \\nThe present mayor, Ras Baraka, a more tra- \\nditional rabble-rouser, has hired new cops, \\nbut the police force remains troubled (it is, \\nuniquely, monitored by the federal Justice \\nDepartment).

The deal apparently \\ncaught Mr Abbott by surprise. He had \\nwanted to limit the G20’s climate commit- \\nments to a line about energy efficiency. But \\nclimate change dominated the Brisbane \\nsummit in the wake of Mr Obama’s procla- \\nmation that “here in the Asia Pacific, no- \\nbody has more at stake”. Eew can recall \\nsuch a sharp public rebuke from Austra- \\nlia’s main strategic ally. \\n\\nAustralia is responsible for ah out 1.5% of \\nglobal carbon emissions; measured by its \\noutput per person, it is one of the highest \\npolluters. Yet Mr Abbott has staked his po- \\nlitical career on a combative approach to \\nclimate action. As opposition leader four \\nyears ago, he unseated his predecessor as \\nleader of the conservative Liberal Party \\nover a deal with the then Labor govern- \\nment for an emissions-trading scheme; \\nthat deal sank. Mr Abbott won power last \\nyear after waging a scare campaign against \\na carbon tax Labor had introduced instead; \\nhis government has since abolished it.

Their aim is to strengthen the \\nCommunist Party’s grip on power while at \\nthe same time ensuring that justice is \\nserved more fairly. This may improve the \\nlives of some. Many people complain bit- \\nterly that courts often pay more heed to the \\nwhims of officials than to the law. But in \\nthe realm of death, it is the law itself that is \\nthe problem. The country’s statutes on in- \\nheritance remain little changed from the \\ndays when few had any property to be- \\nqueath. The rapid emergence in recent \\nyears of a large middle-class with complex \\nproperty claims has been fuelling inheri- \\ntance disputes. The crudity of the law is \\nmaking matters worse. \\n\\nToday’s inheritance law was adopted in \\n1985 when divorce and remarriage were \\nrare and international marriage nearly un- \\nknown. Pew owned homes, cars or other \\nvaluable property. The law does at least \\ngrant men and women equal rights to their  \\nkin’s estates, but otherwise it is based \\nlargely on tradition. It is specific when it \\ncomes to handing down “forest trees, live- \\nstock and poultry” but runs out of steam \\nwhen it comes to newfangled notions such \\nas intellectual property; never mind do- \\nmain names and digital photographs. A \\nsweeping reference to “other lawful prop- \\nerty” is its unhelpful attempt to cover all \\neventualities. What counts as property? By \\nwhose laws? The statute has no answers. \\n\\nModest changes were approved in \\n2003, but woolly areas remain such as in \\nprocedures for registering wills. This has \\nled to rancorous court cases like one that \\nlast month attracted much public atten- \\ntion. It involved a disputed will and the \\nembattled surviving family members of a \\nfamous calligrapher and his estate worth \\nabout 2 billion yuan ($326m). \\n\\nSince the last revisions to the law, soci- \\nety has kept up its blistering pace of \\nchange. The divorce rate has risen in each \\nof the past ten years. In 2009 divorces out- \\nnumbered marriages. Thus there are now \\nex-spouses and stepchildren among those \\nsquabbling over estates. China’s embrace \\nof globalisation means that some assets \\n(and indeed, clamouring relatives) are lo- \\ncated in other countries. \\n\\nChina’s one-child policy has some- \\ntimes complicated matters.

General Martin Dempsey, Ameri- \\nca’s chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, on \\nNovember 15th told American troops in \\nIraq that the battle is “starting to turn”- \\nthough it will take time to defeat the jiha- \\ndists. The UN’s envoy for Iraq, Nickolay \\nMladenov, assured the Security Council \\nthat the strategy of enlisting local forces \\nwas showing signs of progress. “We’re not \\nlooking at the collapse of the Iraqi state,” \\nhe said. “We’ve turned the tide.” \\n\\nAfter months of setbacks the wobbly \\nAmerican-led coalition battling is has halt- \\ned the group’s momentum and begun to \\nseize the initiative. Relentless air attacks \\nhave depleted the group’s arsenals, re- \\nduced its mobility and reportedly killed \\nseveral of its senior commanders. The co- \\nalition’s campaign has grown in scope and \\nsophistication. A single raid on November \\n19th, targeting a complex of is fortifications \\nnorth-west of Kirkuk, involved aircraft \\nfrom seven countries. \\n\\nThere is movement on the ground, too. \\nOn November 14th Iraqi government \\nforces scored their most hopeful battlefield \\nadvance to date: the recapture of the giant \\noil refinery at Baiji, a town along the Tigris \\nriver between the Iraqi capital, Baghdad, \\nand its rebel-held second city, Mosul. The \\nsuccess not only returned a big economic \\nasset to government hands, but also sev- \\nered the link between a pocket of is forces \\nin Tikrit and a larger zone under its sway to \\nthe north. Kurdish and Iraqi government \\nforces and allied militias are said to be \\npoised for an offensive from the east into \\nthis area. Tikrit, largely abandoned by its \\npeople, may not stay long in is hands. \\n\\nIraq’s internal politics may also be less \\npoisonous than before. Unlike its narrow- \\nmindedly pro-Shia predecessor, the gov- \\nernment of Haider al-Abadi has made an \\neffort to win over the minority Sunnis, \\nwhose anger at being marginalised fuelled \\nis’s rise.

This improving po- \\nlitical climate should foster closer military \\nco-operation between the Kurds and the \\ncentral government, and raises the chance \\nthat more Sunni tribes can be coaxed onto  \\nthe government’s side in a repeat of Ameri- \\nca’s belated but ultimately successful effort \\nto subdue restless Sunni regions during its \\noccupation of Iraq. \\n\\nCoalition bombing in Syria, mean- \\nwhile, has sharply reduced the flow of con- \\ntraband oil, a big source of is funding.

On November 29th the party will \\nelect a new leader and the same politician, \\nNicolas Sarkozy, is (one French presidency \\nlater) again campaigning for the post. The \\nodds are heavily in his favour. But the con- \\ntest is not turning out to be quite the land- \\nslide he had expected. \\n\\nWhen Mr Sarkozy first announced his \\npolitical comeback, in September, the polls \\nmade him the hands-down favourite \\namong party supporters. Neither of his \\ntwo rivals, Bruno Le Maire and Herve Ma- \\nriton, both one-time ministers, had cap- \\ntured the public imagination. The party \\nseemed in need of a strong unifying figure \\nafter the in-fighting that followed the resig- \\nnation of its previous head, Jean-Frangois \\nCope, amid party-financing irregularities. \\nAnd Mr Sarkozy still has star appeal.  More than a dozen town-hall meetings \\naround the country later, however, Mr Sar- \\nkozy’s campaign is not running as smooth- \\nly as he might have hoped. In October his \\npopularity among ump supporters \\ndropped by 13 points from the previous \\nmonth, to 71%, according to bva, a pollster. \\nHe was overtaken by Alain Juppe, a former \\nprime minister, who is not running for the \\nparty leadership but is a rival candidate for \\nthe 2017 presidential nomination. Among \\nUMP deputies, Mr Sarkozy’s return has not \\nbeen universally welcomed. “Even if he is \\nelected with 70% of the vote,” says one, “it \\nwill be a big disappointment for him.” \\n\\nNo single moment explains this. Mr Sar- \\nkozy was not at his best during a television \\ninterview last month. This week he \\nprompted consternation, even among \\nsome supporters, by suggesting that he \\nmight repeal the law legalising gay mar- \\nriage. Yet he has put in energetic perfor- \\nmances in school gyms and exhibition \\nhalls around France, and at times been an \\nincisive critic of President Francois Hol- \\nlande’s unpopular Socialist government. \\n\\nMr Sarkozy’s team is still talking up his \\nexpected win as a triumph.

It has raised $1.5 billion in venture \\ncapital and reached a valuation of more \\nthan $17 billion. It has expanded to 229 cit- \\nies in 46 countries. It is rumoured to be \\nbringing in gross revenues of almost $1 bil- \\nlion a month. But it now seems, in record \\ntime, to have gone from hero to villain in \\nthe eyes of much of the technology press. \\nPraised in its early days for disrupting unre- \\nliable, high-cost local taxi monopolies, \\nUber now stands accused of using unfair \\ntactics against both rivals and critics. \\n\\nOn November 17th it emerged that an \\nUber executive, Emil Michael, had said at a \\nprivate dinner that the firm should consid- \\ner spending $im to dig up dirt on its critics \\nin the media, in particular Sarah Lacy, the \\neditor of Pando, a tech-news site. Mr Mi- \\nchael has since apologised. Travis Kalan- \\nick, Uber’s boss, said on Twitter that his re- \\nmarks showed “a lack of humanity and a \\ndeparture from our values and ideals”, but \\nbrushed off calls for Mr Michael to resign. \\n\\nAlthough it is hardly an excuse, the re- \\nmarks were a reaction to a series of highly \\ncritical articles on Uber, in particular by Ms \\nLacy and her publication. She has argued \\nthat Mr Kalanick, known for his libertarian \\nviews and combativeness, is an example \\nof Silicon Valley’s “asshole problem”, \\nmeaning that venture capitalists increas- \\ningly invest in entrepreneurs who know \\nneither scruples nor social graces. Most re- \\ncently, she accused the firm of “sexism and \\nmisogyny” because its branch in Lyon, \\nPrance, had offered to pair passengers with \\n“hot chick” drivers. She says she has de- \\nleted the Uber app from her smartphone. \\n\\nUber has never feared controversy. In \\nits drive to disrupt taxi markets it has often \\nignored local regulations, leading to court- \\nordered bans on its services. It has emerged \\nthat the firm has sent “brand ambassa- \\ndors” to hire cabs through Lyft, a rival app, \\nwho would then either cancel them, or \\npress their drivers to defect to Uber. Mr Ka- \\nlanick has also admitted to having inter- \\nvened in its rival’s fund-raising attempts by \\ntelling potential investors that his firm was \\nalso about to raise large amounts of capital. \\n\\nThe network effects in the taxi-app \\nbusiness are strong: as a firm recruits more \\ndrivers, this reduces pickup times, which \\nattracts more passengers; this in turn at- \\ntracts more drivers, since they get more  fares on each shift. That winners and losers \\nemerge so quickly explains the need for a \\ndegree of ruthlessness.

Bosses of listed companies give off-the-record briefings to \\njournalists bemoaning shareholders’ inability to see beyond the \\nends of their noses. In the continental European model of capital- \\nism, long-termism means that businesses will prosper by pursu- \\ning the enduring interests of all their “stakeholders”, workers and \\nsuppliers included. More recently, supporters of Anglo-Saxon \\ncapitalism have produced a variant of this argument: firms will \\nenjoy sustained growth if they favour the interests of long-term \\nshareholders over traders who hold stock for briefer periods. \\n\\nThis is not merely rhetoric. Policymakers are drawing up plans \\nto give long-term investors more shares, more voting power or \\ntax incentives. France already has a rule that gives extra voting \\nrights to long-term shareholders; and the European Commission \\nis mulling something similar. The Delaware Supreme Court- \\nwhich sets the tone of much American corporate law because so \\nmany companies are registered in that state-has endorsed the \\nview that a firm’s owners are those who have held its shares for a \\nlong time (though it has not said how long), rather than those \\nwho happen to own them at any given moment. \\n\\nIt is easy to see why long-termism has become so fashionable. \\nRepeated financial-market crises, including the one in 2007-08, \\nhave reinforced a view that short-term traders are nothing but \\ntrouble.

In America, one beneficiary of this un- \\nfortunate squeeze on credit is a form of mu- \\ntual fund that lends to businesses, known \\nas a business-development company \\n(bdc). bdcs have been around since the \\n1980s but have recently multiplied. More \\nthan 50 of them are now listed, with a com- \\nbined market capitalisation in excess of $35 \\nbillion (see chart).  \\nSource: MLV & Co *As of November 19th \\n\\nBDCS are allowed to borrow as much \\nmoney as they raise from shareholders, \\nusually through fixed-rate bonds, so the to- \\ntal amount at their disposal is approxi- \\nmately $70 billion. That is not much. The \\nindustry’s total valuation is only a quarter \\nof Citigroup’s, and were they to lend out \\nthis entire sum, it would equal just 4% of \\nAmerica’s commercial and industrial \\nloans. In reality, some of their money is in- \\nvested in shares and some goes into prop- \\nerty, so their impact is even smaller. \\n\\nStill, BDCS are big enough to be receiv- \\ning attention from businesses hungry for \\ncapital and willing to pay interest of 10% or \\nmore to get it, as well as from investors \\nhungry for dividends, which can also ex- \\nceed 10%. That is more than four times the \\ndividend on the average stock and more \\nthan double the yield of even a junk bond. \\n\\nThe high payout comes with a caveat, \\nhowever. Because bdcs are classified as a \\nfund, they pay no corporate tax, unlike a \\nbank. To preserve this status, they must dis- \\ntribute 90% or more of their income each \\nyear. As a result, building up their capital \\nbase is a slog. So too is finding good cus- \\ntomers for loans, since they do not offer the \\nprosaic products like current and payroll \\naccounts through which banks typically \\nacquire their customers. Many bdcs spe- \\ncialise in financing the acquisitions of priv- \\nate-equity firms. That helps to keep down \\ncosts, as they make big loans to just a few \\ncustomers. But it can also suppress returns, \\nas there is lots of competition to back priv- \\nate-equity deals. \\n\\nAlthough BDC’s limited borrowing \\nmakes them safer than banks, they also \\nsuffer from higher defaults. As a result, \\nwhen the financial markets become vola- \\ntile, and in particular when the market for \\nhigh-yield debt wobbles, their shares \\nslump and they struggle to raise capital. \\n\\nAnother quirk is that all but a handful \\nof BDCS do not have internal managers; in- \\nstead, they farm out their management to \\nnotionally independent firms.

       "  'I N THE late 1930s economists trying to explain how a depression \\ncould drag on for nearly a decade wondered if the problem was \\na shortage of people. “A change-over from an increasing to a de- \\nclining population may be very disastrous,” said John Maynard \\nKeynes in 1937.* The following year another prominent econo- \\nmist, Alvin Hansen, fretted that America was running out of peo- \\nple, territory and new ideas. The result, he said, was “secular stag- \\nnation-sick recoveries which die in their infancy and \\ndepressions which feed on themselves and leave a hard and \\nseemingly immovable core of unemployment.” \\n\\nA year ago Larry Summers of Harvard University revived the \\nterm “secular stagnation” to describe the rich world’s prolonged \\nmalaise. Weak demand and excess savings were making it impos- \\nsible to stimulate growth with the usual tool of low short-term in- \\nterest rates, he argued. Demographics may play a central role in \\nthe ailment Mr Summers described-indeed, a more central one \\nthan in the 1930s. \\n\\nAn ageing population could hold down growth and interest \\nrates through several channels. The most direct is through the \\nsupply of labour. An economy’s potential output depends on the \\nnumber of workers and their productivity. In both Germany and \\nJapan, the working-age population has been shrinking for more \\nthan a decade, and the rate of decline will accelerate in coming \\nyears (see chart). Britain’s potential workforce will stop growing \\nin coming decades; America’s will grow at barely a third of the \\n0.9% rate that prevailed from 2000 to 2013. \\n\\nAll else being equal, a half percentage-point drop in the \\ngrowth of the labour force will trim economic growth by a simi- \\nlar amount. Such an effect should be felt gradually. But the reces- \\nsion may have accelerated the process by encouraging many \\nworkers to take early retirement. In America the first baby boom- \\ners qualified for Social Security, the public pension, in 2008, on \\nturning 62. According to several studies, this can probably explain \\nabout half the drop since then in the share of the working-age \\npopulation either working or looking for work, from 66% to be- \\nlow 63%. (This echoes the experience of Japan, which slid into \\nstagnation and deflation in the 1990s around the same time as its \\nworking-age population began to shrink.) \\n\\nThe size and age of the population also influences how many \\ncustomers and workers businesses can tap, and so how much \\nthey will invest.

The inside of \\nreactor four is a mess of twisted metal, na- \\nked nuclear fuel and lumps of “corium”, a \\nlava-like substance formed when reactor \\nfuel melted and mixed with the concrete \\nfloor of the reactor building. This building \\nis so radioactive that anyone walking \\naround in it would accumulate a lethal \\ndose in minutes. Even robots working \\nthere will need to be hardened against the \\nradiation, and also dexterous enough to \\nnavigate through what is, essentially, a \\nbomb site. Those involved concede that \\nthe technology needed to do this does not \\nyet exist. But once the nsc is in place, there \\nwill be plenty of time to invent it.  until about 3,600 years ago. Only then \\ndid farming spread to cover places with \\nan altitude of up to 4,700 metres. \\n\\nThis is odd, because 4,000 years ago \\nthe climate in the area became distinctly \\ncolder. If anything, the maximum alti- \\ntude of farms would have been expected \\nto fall, not rise. So what accounts for the \\nspread? \\n\\nThe clue is in the crops. Sites below \\nthe crucial contour line are dominated by \\nmillet. Those above it are dominated by \\nbarley. Though barley has a longer grow- \\ning season than millet, it is more tolerant \\nof the cold. Barley was part of a farming \\nrevolution that happened in the Middle \\nEast as millet and rice were spreading in \\nChina. It arrived in Tibet at just the right \\ntime. Tibet’s farmers were able to expand \\nconfidently upwards instead of being \\nforced downhill, and the roof of the \\nworld, a habitat about as different from \\nthe African savannah in which Homo \\nsapiens evolved as it is possible to imag- \\nine, was nevertheless absorbed success- \\nfully into the human empire.  There may, though, be little incentive to \\ndo so.

       "  'A new way to fight bacterial infections \\n\\nur job”, says Jan Kemper, “is to \\n\\nmake cells happy.” Ms Kemper \\nworks at Medimmune, a subsidiary of \\nAstraZeneca based in Gaithersburg, Mary- \\nland. Her laboratory contains 40 bioreac- \\ntors-fluid-filled tanks of about three litres’ \\ncapacity. Paddles within them whirl \\naround a mixture of nutrient broth and \\nspecially engineered hamster cells that are \\nbusy making human antibodies. \\n\\nIt is, indeed, cell heaven in one of these \\nreactors. It is also part of a new front in the \\nancient war between man and microbe, \\nfor the antibodies Ms Kemper’s cells pro- \\nduce are designed to attack bacteria, and \\nthus back up conventional antibiotics, \\nsome of which are failing in the face of ris- \\ning bacterial resistance. \\n\\nIn America alone, at least 2m illnesses a \\nyear-and 23,000 deaths-are caused by \\nantibiotic-resistant bacteria. Besides the \\nhuman suffering this inflicts, it adds $20 \\nbillion to the annual cost of health care. \\nThe toll is such that, in September, Barack \\nObama directed federal agencies to take \\naction against antibiotic-resistant bacteria. \\n\\nA task-force, ordered to report in February, \\nhas been appointed. And the Department \\nof Health and Human Services is putting \\nup a $2om prize for a rapid, diagnostic test \\nfor such bacteria. But a diagnosis is of little \\nvalue without a treatment. Which is where \\nantibodies come in. \\n\\nHorse sense \\n\\nAntibodies are proteins that have special \\nsites on them which can vary in shape in \\nmyriad ways. Each variation is tailored to \\nstick to one or a handful of specific other \\nmolecules, known as antigens, and neu- \\ntralise them. If an antigen is part of a bacte- \\nrium or virus, that gets neutralised too. \\n\\nUsing antibodies to treat infections is \\nnot a new idea. The first Nobel prize in \\nmedicine, awarded in 1901, went to Emil \\nvon Behring for discovering how to em- \\nploy antitoxins, as he called them, to treat \\ndiphtheria. Von Behring found he could \\ntransfer them from infected horses to sick \\npeople by injecting those people with \\nhorse-blood serum. In the wake of this dis- \\ncovery, serum therapy became, until the in- \\nvention of antibiotics, the main way of \\ntreating not only diphtheria but also teta- \\nnus, scarlet fever and meningitis. It faded \\ninto the background after the invention of \\nantibiotics, but is still employed for neu- \\ntralising snake venom and-albeit experi- \\nmentally-for treating Ebola fever. How-   ever, now that biotechnology allows \\nparticular antibodies to be created in lab- \\noratories like Ms Kemper’s, the technique \\nis poised to return to wider use, albeit in a \\nslightly different guise. \\n\\nMerck, a large American drug company, \\nis testing a combination of two antibodies \\nagainst toxins made by Clostridium diffi- \\ncile, a bacterium that plagues hospitals and \\nwhich can be hard to treat with conven- \\ntional antibiotics. The past few years have \\nseen a particularly virulent strain of this \\nbug emerge, and death rates have in- \\ncreased. Early'],\n",

This was because his field was glass, a \\nmaterial so unique and strange-not solid, \\nliquid or gas, but a liquid frozen in an un- \\nstable state-that in 3,500 years of history it \\nhad kept its secrets intact. His liveliest men- \\ntal companion, as he worked away for al- \\nmost five decades among the smokestacks \\nof the Corning Glass Works in upstate New \\nYork, was Johann Kunckel, first finder in \\nthe 17th century of a formula for gold ruby \\nglass, who believed that cups made of this \\ncould transmit to drinkers the virtues of \\nthe philosopher’s stone. \\n\\nHe also saw himself as an explorer, the \\nsort he had loved to read about in child- \\nhood, opening doors into unseen worlds; \\nor, being an avid hunter and fisherman, as \\na tracker of elusive prey. Hence his original \\nventure into glass, as he left mix in 1940  with a doctorate but with job offers only \\nfrom Corning and Nabisco, a bakery com- \\npany. He did not want to bake, so chose to \\ndo research into milky white opal glass. He \\nknew nothing of either the substance or \\nthe chemistry, but found it mysterious and \\nbeautiful and hoped it might be useful. \\n\\nThe job was still almost artisan, with \\nhis glass samples heated in one-pound \\nbatches in clay crucibles by a gruff old \\nglass-blower. But he succeeded after some \\nyears in making opal glass photosensitive, \\nso that three-dimensional designs could be \\netched into it by the action of light. Taking \\nclues from nature, he made this “Foto- \\nform” glass resemble frost-lace, spiders’ \\nwebs and a honeycomb, in which honey- \\nbees actually produced honey. He also per- \\nfected a glass which, in daylight, looked \\nlike marble, and now covers the north face \\nof the UN headquarters in New York. \\n\\nA nucleus of gold \\n\\nThe joy of glass, he soon discovered, lay \\nnot only in its resilience and transparency \\nbut in its very instability, and its yearning \\nto reach a lower-energy crystalline state. \\nEvery one of his inventions depended on a \\nprocess called “nucleation”, in which the \\nsmallest stable trace of any element, added \\nto molten glass, became a nucleus round \\nwhich crystals would grow until, by cool-  ing, he chose to stop them. Tiny light-scat- \\ntering particles of sodium fluoride made \\nopal glass; mites of copper or gold made \\nthe ruby glass he so admired.

       "  'HE INTERSECTION of 38th Street and \\n\\nChicago Avenue has, since George \\nFloyd was killed there on May 25th, become \\na shrine, pilgrimage destination and pub- \\nlic-art exhibition. A huge raised fist sur- \\nrounded by flowers stands at the intersec- \\ntion’s centre. “You Changed the World, \\nGeorge, with sunflowers beneath and \\nclouds above, is painted on the purple side \\nof a squat building across the street. Amid \\nall the expressions of grief and resolve \\nstands an imperative: at the centre of a row \\nof roses pinned to a clothesline, a laminat- \\ned sheet of paper asks people to “Creatively \\nimagine a world without police.” For two \\nmonths, many in Minneapolis have been \\ndoing just that—and discovering just how \\nwide the gulf between creative imagina- \\ntion and running acity is. \\n\\nAt a rally on June 6th Jacob Frey, Minne- \\napolis’s mayor, was jeered after telling the \\ncrowd that he did not support abolishing \\nthe police department. At another rally the \\nnext afternoon in Powderhorn Park, not far \\nfrom where Mr Floyd was killed, nine city \\ncouncillors pledged to do just that. The city \\ncouncil voted unanimously to abolish the \\ndepartment later that month. \\n\\nThey have proposed amending the city’s \\ncharter to replace the police department \\nwith a “Department of Community Safety \\nand Violence Prevention, which will have \\nresponsibility for public safety services \\nprioritising a holistic, public health-ori-  ented approach.” Their proposal also re- \\nmoves the mayor’s “complete power over \\nthe establishment, maintenance and com- \\nmand over the police department,’ and \\ngives the City Council shared oversight \\nover the new department. \\n\\nTheir proposal is before the city’s Char- \\nter Commission (analogous to a constitu- \\ntional court) for review, and the council \\nwants it on the ballot in November. Even if \\nit passes, state labour law could intrude. \\nPublic employers cannot “interfere with \\nthe existence of employee organisations,” \\nsuch as a union. Abolishing the police de- \\npartment would presumably entail abol- \\nishing the union, and the union would pre- \\nsumably fight abolition in court. \\n\\nWhether the plan has the appeal to pass \\nremains unclear, but one thing almost \\neveryone in the city agrees on is that the \\nStatus quo is not working. Raeisha Wil- \\nliams, an activist and entrepreneur who \\nran for City Council in 2017, says that “there \\nis a huge disproportion in how [African- \\nAmericans] are treated” by the city’s police \\nforce. Steven Belton, a lifelong Minnesotan \\nwho heads the Urban League Twin Cities, \\nsays that “standard operating procedure” \\namong city police officers “assumes that \\nAfrican-Americans generally and black \\nmen in particular are hostile, dangerous \\nand require maximum force and must be \\nsubdued for the most ordinary and mun- \\ndane encounters with police.’ Before  George Floyd, there were Philando Castile, \\nJamar Clark and Christopher Burns, all \\nblack men killed by police in the Minne- \\napolis area.

They are 19 and 18 \\nyears old respectively and live within a \\ncouple of hours’ drive of Delhi, albeit in op- \\nposite directions. They both happen to be \\nDalits, from the bottom ranks of India’s vo- \\nluminous caste register. And they have also \\nboth been in the news lately, though for \\nvery different reasons. \\n\\nIn mid-July the smiling, bespectacled \\nMr Singh won brief fame by scoring a flaw- \\nless 100 out of 100 in each of five subjects in \\nschool-leaving exams—the best marks in \\nthe country. He wants to study history, he \\ntold interviewers, and enter the Indian Ad- \\nministrative Service, the top echelon of the \\nbureaucracy. Mr Pal, in contrast, appeared \\nWearing a pink shirt and grey trousers ina \\nviral video last year in which two young \\nmen from the landowning Jat caste force \\nhim to pull down his trousers and then beat \\nhim with a heavy stick. His tormentors  were angry because Mr Pal, having founda \\njob in a factory making smartphone \\nscreens, refused to work their land or look \\nafter their cows, as Dalits in the Jat-domin- \\nated village have done for generations. \\nSeventy years ago, India’s constitution, \\nlargely written by B.R. Ambedkar, a Dalit \\nintellectual, declared all citizens equal be- \\nfore the law. It abolished untouchability, \\nmaking the Hindu practice a punishable \\noffence, and enjoined the state to improve \\nthe lot of the “weaker sections” of society. \\nDalits’ circumstances have indeed im-  proved. The rigid, ritual shunning of them \\nhas largely faded. Three generations of \\nquotas in legislative bodies, in state \\nschools and in government service have \\ncreated a lower-caste bourgeoisie, such \\nthat mid-ranked castes began lobbying for, \\nand eventually won their own “reserva- \\ntions”. Caste-based parties have sprung up \\nto agitate for more government help, and \\nwon power in many states. \\n\\nGiven all this, the stellar success of Mr \\nSingh ought to be unremarkable, just as the \\ncasual violence and ritual humiliation in- \\nflicted on Mr Pal ought to be unthinkable. \\nYet Mr Singh’s caste, revealed by the proud \\nportrait of Ambedkar in the young schol- \\nar’s living room, was widely remarked \\nupon. Mr Singh is also unusual in that he \\nattended a top private school. His parents \\nare college teachers. \\n\\nMr Pal’s luck is of a different kind. It is \\nlucky that he, like many Dalits who have \\nfound ways to escape the only jobs previ- \\nously open to them, such as share-crop- \\nping, waste removal and tanning, no lon- \\nger needs higher-caste patrons. He is also \\nlucky to be alive. Few Hindus any longer \\nobserve strict ritual purity or consider Da- \\nlits literally “untouchable”.

Police in their home province \\nof Henan, in central China, concluded that \\nthe toddler had been murdered. Soon they \\nsaid they had caught the culprit: Wu Chun- \\nhong, a 34-year-old neighbour with three \\nchildren of his own. Under interrogation, \\nMr Wu told police that he had quarrelled \\nwith the boy’s father over a small debt. He \\nsaid that he had taken revenge by sneaking \\ninto the family’s kitchen and sprinkling rat \\npoison into cooking ingredients. \\n\\nIn April this year Mr Wu was freed from \\nprison, his conviction quashed during a \\nbrief hearing that was held online as a re- \\nsult of the covid-19 pandemic. For 16 years \\nMr Wu had maintained that his confession \\nwas false and had been obtained through \\ntorture. He said that he had been shackled \\nand beaten, and that his resistance had bro- \\nken when police threatened to subject his \\nwife to the same treatment. His case is the  most recent of more than 60 big miscar- \\nriages of justice that have been made public \\nsince Xi Jinping took power in 2012, re- \\nsearchers at New York University (NYU) cal- \\nculate. The overturning of these verdicts is \\nproof, officials say, that China’s criminal \\njustice system is working better. \\n\\nMany wrongful convictions have come \\nto light after re-examination of cases relat- \\ned to China’s occasional nationwide “strike \\nhard” campaigns against serious offences. \\nBig ones in 1996 and 2000-01 aimed to curb \\na rise in crime that followed the disman- \\ntling of the old state-run economy, and the \\neasing of strict social controls that went \\nwith it. Short-staffed police bureaus were \\ngiven high targets for the number of people \\nto be rounded up. This led to many arbi- \\ntrary arrests, a problem compounded by  the incompetence and bias of judges and \\nprosecutors, who often lacked legal train- \\ning. Many had simply been assigned to the \\njobs after military service. \\n\\nAnti-crime campaigns on such a scale \\nare rarer these days, but much about Chi- \\nna’s criminal system remains woeful. Only \\n30% of criminal defendants are represent- \\ned by lawyers, guesses Ira Belkin of NYU. \\nVerdicts are almost always agreed before \\ntrials begin, during private meetings of \\njudges, police and prosecutors.

Dark-skinned \\npeople are referred to with terms like abd \\n(“slave”). Egypt's dark-skinned former \\npresident, Anwar Sadat, was called his pre- \\ndecessor’s “black poodle”. Blackface is a \\ncommon sight on Arabic television. In a \\nwidely shared video a black Palestinian ac- \\ntress, Maryam Abu Khaled, recounted the \\ncasual bigotry she encounters, such as a \\nmother telling her daughter to get out of \\nthe sun lest she, too, turn black. \\n\\nSkin colour can make marriages fraught \\nwhen families see it as a marker of socio- \\neconomic status or pedigree. Discrimina- \\ntion exists in the workplace, too. Black Ira- \\nqis, a community with more than a \\nthousand years of recorded history, strug- \\ngle to get government jobs and are typically \\nrelegated to menial work. \\n\\nThe worst treatment, though, is re- \\nserved not for citizens but for migrants. In \\nwealthy Gulf states it manifests in a tacit \\nracial hierarchy. Fancy hotels might em- \\nploy black migrants as security guards or \\nporters.

Some said it beat the re- \\ncord held by a mammoth discussion in \\nNice in 2000. Others thought it fell 25 min- \\nutes short. Either way, it was a landmark \\nevent.

The \\ncirculation of other sARS-like viruses could \\nhave conferred a generalised immunity to \\nsuch pathogens. So, if a new one emerged \\nin the region, it was able to take hold in the \\nhuman population only when it travelled \\nall the way to central China—where people \\ndid not have this natural resistance. \\n\\nThis would tie in with the idea that in- \\nfection with one coronavirus can provide \\nprotection against others, and that even in \\ncountries away from the evolutionary caul- \\ndron of South-East Asia part of the popula- \\ntion may have some protection against the \\ncurrent pandemic. In particular, there are \\nSuggestions that protection might be con- \\nferred mainly via part of the immune sys- \\ntem called T-cells (which work by killing vi- \\nrus-infected cells) rather than via anti- \\nbodies (which work by gumming up patho- \\ngens). If that is the case, then serological \\nstudies which look at antibodies may be \\nunderestimating natural immunity. \\n\\nSunetra Gupta, an epidemiologist at Ox- \\nford, argues that natural immunity to co- \\nvid-19 is conferred by infections with sea- \\nsonal coronaviruses. If correct, this has \\nimplications for the level of vaccination \\nneeded to reach herd immunity. Itis widely \\nassumed that over 50% of people need to be \\nvaccinated to prevent a resurgence of SARS- \\nCOvV-2. Ina preprint rele'],\n",

He said the megastar \\nexecutive had skipped bail and fled to Leba- \\nnon. In a statement released a day later \\nthrough a spokeswoman, Mr Ghosn insist- \\ned: “I have not fled justice—I have escaped \\ninjustice and political persecution.”  Who ya gonna call? Ghosnbusters! \\n\\nHis dramatic escape has raised big ques- \\ntions for Japan. How did he do it, despite \\nconstant surveillance of his movements? \\nAnd is there any truth to his claims that the \\ncharges against him were politically moti- \\nvated? Before his arrest in Tokyo in Novem- \\nDer 2018, Mr Ghosn had been rumoured to \\nbe working ona merger between Renault, a \\nFrench carmaker, and its partner Nissan, a \\nJapanese company. This would have of-  fended many in the Japanese establish- \\nment, as it would have looked like a foreign \\ntakeover of aJapanese industrial icon. \\nHow Mr Ghosn managed to flee was still \\na mystery as we went to press. Local media \\nin Lebanon said he arrived in Beirut from \\nTurkey on a private jet. Yet NHK, Japan’s \\nState broadcaster, reported that Japanese \\nimmigration officials had no record of him \\nleaving the country. Mr Ghosn’s lawyer, Hi- \\nronaka Junichiro, said he was “surprised \\nand baffled” by his client’s departure. He \\nsaid he held Mr Ghosn’s passports from \\nLebanon, Brazil and France and it would \\nhave been difficult to pull off such a feat \\n“without the assistance of some large orga- \\nnisation”. Mr Ghosn’s wife, contacted by \\nReuters news agency, described as “fiction” \\nreports that her husband had left his house \\nhidden in a musical-instrument case used \\nby performers who had just played for him. \\nMany in Japan do not agree that Mr \\nGhosn escaped injustice. Officials worry \\nthat his story could embolden other \\nwould-be fugitives. He got away despite his \\nface being widely recognisable. Before his \\narrest he was a hero in Japan for having  helped to revive Nissan, and had even fea- \\ntured in a manga comic series. An official \\nfrom the prosecutor’s office told Japanese \\nmedia that Mr Ghosn had made a mockery \\nof the criminal-justice system. \\n\\nMr Ghosn stands accused of misappro- \\npriating company funds—allegations he \\ndenies, saying he was framed by “back- \\nstabbing” Nissan bosses. After more than \\n120 days in jail, he was released in April \\n2.019 on bail of ¥1.5bn ($13.8m). His trial had \\nbeen due to begin in April 2020. He is un- \\nlikely to attend it.

The federal government has called in \\nmilitary planes and ships to help evacuate \\npeople sheltering on beaches in both \\nStates. Experts say the fires are the most ex- \\ntensive in Australia’s history and are far \\nfrom over. They have sparked heated de- \\nbate about the impact of climate change \\nand the government’s equivocal commit- \\nment to tackling it. \\n\\nNew South Wales is the country’s most \\npopulous state and has suffered some of \\nthe biggest losses: 15 lives and about 1,300 \\nhomes. (Pictured is a house under threat in \\nLake Conjola.) The state’s bushfires have \\ncovered almost 40,000 square kilometres, \\nnearly the area of Denmark. That is greater \\nthan the total area during the past three \\nyears’ fire seasons. These usually start in \\nOctober, Australia’s mid-spring. In 2019 the \\nfires began in July. A drought that started in \\neastern Australia three years ago had left \\nplenty of dry fuel. On December 18th Aus- \\ntralia as a whole had its hottest day on re- \\ncord, at 41.9°C. The fires have spread across \\nthe country, at one point closing the high- \\nway to the Nullarbor Plain that links West- \\nern Australia to the east coast. \\n\\nIn early December former fire chiefs \\ncalled on the government to help organise \\nan emergency meeting to discuss the grow- \\ning threat of wildfires amid global warm- \\ning.

Behind \\nthe jargon lies a brutal reality: a drawn-out, \\nbloody conflict looms. China’s leaders sim- \\nilarly use prim, technical-sounding terms \\nto describe their confrontation with Amer- \\nica. In closed-door briefings and chats with \\nWestern bigwigs, they chide the country \\nled by President Donald Trump for re- \\nsponding to China’s rise with “strategic \\nanxiety” (ie, fear). They insist that China’s \\nonly crime is to have grown so rapidly. \\n\\nHowever, behind that chilly, self-serv- \\ning analysis lurks a series of angrier, more \\nprimal calculations about relative heft. \\nThese began before Mr Trump came to of- \\nfice, and will continue even if an initial \\ntrade truce is made formal (Mr Trump says \\nhe will sign one on January 15th). They will \\nendure long after November, when Ameri- \\ncan voters next choose a president. China \\nhas spent decades growing stronger and \\nricher. It already senses that only one \\ncountry—America—can defy Chinese am-  bitions with any confidence. Its leaders \\nhave a bleak worldview in which might \\nmakes right, and it is a fairy tale to pretend \\nthat universal rules bind all powers equal- \\nly. Increasingly, they can imagine a day \\nwhen even America ducks a direct chal- \\nlenge, and the global balance of power \\nshifts for ever.  Getting hairy \\nChina does not seek a fight now. Like a \\npowerful juvenile warily sizing up a silver- \\nback gorilla—his age and status marked by \\nthe silvery fur on his back, and his mighty \\nmuscles and teeth—China knows that \\nAmerica can inflict terrible damage, as it \\nwields still-unrivalled economic, financial \\nand military might. But officials and schol- \\nars in Beijing no longer bother to conceal \\ntheir impatience and scorn for an America \\nthey view—with a perilous mix of hubris \\nand paranoia—as old, tired and clumsy. \\nWhen addressing foreigners, China’s \\nleaders talk piously of their commitment \\nto free trade, market opening and globali- \\nsation. Their domestic actions betray a dif-  ferent agenda: namely, to make Chinese \\ncompanies dominant in high-value manu- \\nfacturing sectors, and to hasten the day \\nwhen they no longer depend on America \\nfor vital technologies. Long before Mr \\nTrump was elected, China pursued such \\npolicies as “indigenous innovation” and \\n“civil-military fusion”. Since Mr Trump’s \\ntariff war with China began in 2018, Presi- \\ndent Xi Jinping and his underlings have ac- \\ncelerated efforts to make China self-suffi- \\ncient in high-value sectors, creating supply \\nchains that are “autonomous, controllable, \\nsafe and effective”, in Mr X1’s words. \\n\\nFor decades Chinese officials have seen \\nbilateral relations swinging, pendulum- \\nlike, between periods of hostility (notably \\nduring American elections, when candi- \\ndates promise to shield workers from un- \\nfair Chinese competition) and a profit-dri- \\nven willingness to engage.

It was \\nnot by chance that the Rand Club, the \\noldest private-members’ club in the city, \\nwas filled with old white men. It was by \\ndesign. Women and blacks were not \\nadmitted as members until the early \\n1990s. ‘It was not my space, says Ms \\nThompson. “That was the power of apart- \\nheid: you never questioned where you \\ncouldn't go.” \\n\\nThe Rand Club was once a centre of \\npower in Johannesburg, the haunt of \\nfinanciers and mining magnates, in- \\ncluding Cecil Rhodes and Lionel Phillips, \\nwho in 1913 was inconveniently shot bya \\ntrade unionist on the way to lunch (he \\nsurvived, but missed his meal). Its offi- \\ncial history calls it “a civilised refuge for \\ngood fellows”. Rules imposed decorum; \\nno ice in drinks in the billiards room, for \\nexample, lest clinking distract players. At \\nthe same time the longest bar in Africa \\n(31.2 metres) encouraged inebriation. \\n\\nBut for most South Africans the club \\nwas seen as the reactionary lair of a racist \\nbusiness elite. Legend has it that decor \\ndepicting the signs of the zodiac does not \\ninclude Virgo, a female sign. Any mem- \\nber who dared to sponsor a black friend \\nwould most likely have been ostracised, \\nor “blackballed”. \\n\\nThe Rand Club’s traditions are square- \\nly at odds with today’s multiracial South  Africa. Only a few years ago protests led \\nto the removal of statues of Rhodes at \\ninstitutions such as the University of \\nCape Town. (Rhodes was aco-founder of \\nthe club, where there is still a room \\nnamed after him.) Buta group of younger \\nmembers, including Ms Thompson, who \\nis black and female, believes that it is \\nbetter to transform the club than close it. \\n\\nIn 2016 acrisis presented the new \\ngroup with their opportunity. The club \\nwas nearly bankrupt. Many businesses \\nhad migrated from the inner city and \\nmembership had fallen to a few hundred \\nfrom thousands in the club’s heyday. \\n\\nRick Currie, a fourth-generation \\nmember, and two other members lent it \\n6.5m rand ($450,000). Part of the deal \\nwas to revamp the club, which now hosts \\nweddings, parties, opera recitals and jazz \\nnights. Rooms are rented out on Book- \\ning.com, atravel site. Artists from across \\nAfrica have been invited to display their \\nworks. It houses a bookshop and tailor. \\nAll of these activities have helped the \\nbottom line—the club is profitable for \\nthe first time in decades—and loosened \\nup the straitened atmosphere. \\n\\nFor some the Rand will always bea \\nrelic of a backward era.

For- \\nty years ago an eccentric band of environ- \\nmentalists, peaceniks and anti-nuclear \\nactivists gathered in Karlsruhe to set up a \\npolitical party. In the early 1990s, after the \\nparty stumbled by failing to back German \\nreunification, it merged with civil-society \\ngroups in the former east, yielding a clunky \\nname that survives today: Alliance 90/The \\nGreens. In 1998 the party joined Germany’s \\nfederal government serving for seven years \\nas junior partner to Gerhard Schr6der’s So- \\ncial Democrats (SPD). In 2011, surging in \\npolls after the Fukushima nuclear disaster, \\nthey took control of their first German \\nState: Baden-Wurttemberg, in the rich \\nsouth-west, where Winfried Kretschmann, \\na communist-turned-centrist, remains the \\nGreen premier today. Now a fifth eruption \\nis looming. \\n\\nAs the Greens prepare to mark their \\nAoth birthday on January 13th, they are \\nSquarely ensconced as Germany's second \\nmost popular party (behind Angela Mer- \\nkel’s conservative Christian Democratic \\nUnion, the cpbU), and have a hunger for  power that would have scandalised their \\nhippie forebears. Germany’s next election \\nis due in autumn 2021, if the ailing “grand \\ncoalition” of the cDU (and its Bavarian sis- \\nter party, the csu) and the SPD survives that \\nlong. Whenever it comes, it will almost cer- \\ntainly restore the Greens to government, \\nprobably alongside the cDU/CSU. It is even \\nconceivable that Germany will provide the \\nworld with its first Green leader (bar a \\nshort-lived Latvian premiership in 2004). \\n\\nA confluence of factors explains the \\nGreens’ success. Germany's federal struc- \\nture offers smaller parties a chance to earn \\nexperience, and respect, in the Ldnder \\n(states). Political fragmentation, and Green \\nflexibility—a coalition with conservatives \\nhere, ex-communists there—sees them in \\noffice in 1 of the 16 states, as many as the \\nSPD. This has trained a cadre of Green pro- \\nfessionals in the art of government, rooted \\nthe party across Germany and stoked an ap- \\npetite for power. It has also given the party \\nan effective veto in the Bundesrat (Ger- \\nmany’s upper house, which comprises rep- \\nresentatives of state governments), where \\nit has tightened energy and climate laws.  The party itself has shaped up, too. For \\nthe past two years the Greens have been led \\nby Robert Habeck and Annalena Baerbock, \\na telegenic, cheerful pairing who personify \\nthe triumph of the party’s “Realo” (prag- \\nmatic) wing over its hard-core “Fundis”. Mr \\nHabeck, 50, a perma-stubbled former min- \\nister in the northern state of Schleswig- \\nHolstein with a relaxed manner, has quick- \\nly become one of Germany’s most popular \\npoliticians; Ms Baerbock, 39, is asharp-wit- \\nted MP who knows her party inside-out. \\nWhere previous co-leaders (one from each \\nwing) ran separate party fiefs to keep the \\npeace, the current pair share personnel, \\nphilosophy and even an office.

       "  \"HE CHRISTMAS Of 2018 was a dismal one \\n\\nfor American stockmarket investors. \\nMeagre gains eked out through a volatile \\nyear were reversed at its end, on fears of \\nSlowing global growth and all-out trade \\nwar between America and China. The s&pP \\nindex of large companies tumbled by 15% \\nbetween November 30th and December \\n24th that year. Many thought a recession \\nwas imminent. \\n\\nThe fears proved overblown. The S&P \\n500 rose by 28.9% during 2019, close to the \\n2013 record increase and well above the av- \\nerage annual gain for the past decade (see \\nchart). December is often good for mar- \\nkets—a phenomenon traders call the “San- \\nta rally”. This one was particularly strong, \\nwith the index rising by 2.9%. Markets be- \\nyond America also did well. The FTSE All- \\nWorld, a global index, rose by 24% in dollar \\nterms, its best showing since 2009. \\n\\nShare prices often rise when expecta- \\ntions of future profits do. But earnings have \\nstagnated recently, so that does little to ex- \\nplain this year’s boom. Falling interest \\nrates played a bigger part. These boost  share prices by increasing the comparative \\nvalue of claims to future income streams, \\nsuch as profits. The Federal Reserve, which \\nhad finished 2018 signalling that it would \\ntighten monetary policy, changed course \\nearly in 2019 and indicated that it would \\nease if necessary to offset any shocks \\ncaused by the trade war. Market predic-  tions for policy rates tumbled. During the \\nyear the Fed cut three times, undoing near- \\nly all the previous year’s tightening. \\n\\nAfter turbulence in the repo market, the \\nFed also started to expand its balance-sheet \\nby buying short-dated Treasuries. The \\nmove was billed as a technical solution to \\nproblems in an essential part of the finan- \\ncial system, not as an economic stimulus. \\nBut it may have acted as one, all the same. \\nAfter the financial crisis a decade ago, the \\nFed's swelling balance-sheet was credited \\nwith driving a stockmarket rally. \\n\\nDecember's market oomph seems to \\nhave come from a mini trade deal between \\nAmerica and China. America cancelled \\nplanned new tariffs on Chinese goods and  >» buy more American goods. \\n\\nIt was a good year not just for stocks, but \\nfor most financial assets, including cor- \\nporate debt, government bonds, commod- \\nities and gold. That is unusual. When risky \\nassets such as stocks and high-yield cor- \\nporate debt are rising, safer ones such as \\ngovernment bonds and gold generally fall. \\nInvestors flock from risk to safety in times \\nof crisis, and back again when the outlook \\nimproves. But when policy interest rates \\nfall, bond yields generally do too; and thus \\nbond prices rise. Loose monetary policy \\nalso tends to boost commodity prices. \\nBroad indices of American bond prices rose \\nby 9% in 2019. The price of gold rose by19%. \\n\\nA bumper year, then.

Some researchers, for \\nexample, have found that, in America, \\nCanada and Europe, raising the mini- \\nmum wage tends to decrease employ- \\nment among the least-skilled workers, as \\nfirms downsize to trim costs. Others have \\nfound no effect on employment. And \\nalthough no one douDts that the policy \\nraises wages for the workers who stay \\nemployed, still unsettled is the question \\nof where that extra money comes from. \\n\\nA new paper by Lev Drucker and Katya \\n\\nMazirov of Israel’s Ministry of Finance, \\nand David Neumark of the University of \\nCalifornia, Irvine, examines increases in \\nIsrael’s minimum wage in 2006-08 in \\nsearch of an answer.

Poorer business \\nowners suffered bigger losses. Those on \\nmedian incomes (for the population at \\nlarge) tooka profit hit 8% larger than \\nthose at the 75th percentile. \\n\\nSince business owners with low \\nearnings relative to their peers are still \\nrelatively well off compared with the \\ngeneral population, raising the mini- \\nmum wage is still progressive.

The world’s scientific \\npowers are arguing about what it should look like and where it should be built  EEP UNDER the countryside north of \\n\\nGeneva, straddling the Franco-Swiss \\nborder, one of the most advanced scientific \\nmachines ever built has been banging sub- \\natomic particles together for more than a \\ndecade. This device, the Large Hadron Col- \\nlider (LHC), accelerates beams of protons \\n(members of a class of particle called had- \\nrons) in opposite directions around a27km \\nring until they reach almost the speed of \\nlight. Powerful magnets then force these \\nprotons into head-on collisions, causing \\nthe energy they carry to be converted—as \\ndescribed by Einstein’s best-known equa- \\ntion, E=mc?—into matter. And what mat- \\nter!

High standards \\nThe Standard Model is not, however, a the- \\nory of everything. It leaves many things un- \\nexplained.
