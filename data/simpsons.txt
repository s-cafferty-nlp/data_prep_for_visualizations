EPISODE TITLE: Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire


EPISODE SUMMARY: 



 Homer and Marge drive to Springfield Elementary, late for the school's
 Christmas show.  A class sings ``O Little Town of Bethlehem'' as Marge
 (carrying Maggie, all bundled up) and Homer try to reach their seats.
 Next up is the second grade, presenting, ``Santas of many lands.''  After
 the German and Japanese versions of Santa Claus comes Lisa as Towanga,
 the Santa Claus of the South Seas.  Lisa appears, wearing a witch doctor
 mask and grass skirt, juggling flaming torches.

   Ah, the fourth grade will now favor us with a melody... err...
   medley (hee hee) of holiday flavorites.
   -- Principal Skinhead, err, Skinner hosts the school Christmas show,
      ``''

 They sing Jingle Bells, but Bart chooses some
 alternate lyrics.  He's yanked off the stage.  Time passes...

   Skinner: The fifth grade will now favor us with a scene from Charles
            uh.. Dickens' Christmas Carol.
   Homer:   Ohhhh.... How many grades does this school have!
   -- Watching the school Christmas pageant, ``''

 At home, Marge writes the family Christmas letter, while Homer struggles
 with the Christmas lights, and Bart and Lisa make out their Christmas
 lists.  Maggie practices walking.

   Maggie is walking by herself.  Lisa got straight A's.  And Bart...
   Well, we love Bart.
   -- Marge writes the family Christmas letter,
      ``''

   Marge: [writing] The magic of the season has touched us all.
   Homer: Marge, haven't you finished that stupid letter yet?
   Marge: [writing] Homer sends his love.
   -- Marge writes the family Christmas letter,
      ``''

 Homer asks where the extension cord is, and Marge tells him it's in the
 utility drawer.  Homer fishes it out, to find the cord a complete tangle.
 Marge asks the kids for their letters to Santa, and Bart scoffs, ``Oh
 please, there's only one fat guy who brings us presents, and his name
 ain't Santa.''  Lisa's list is, ``A pony.  A pony.  A pony.  A pony.
 Thank you,'' the same list as the past three years, and Marge tries
 to explain to Lisa that a pony won't fit in Santa's sleigh.  Bart hands
 his list.

   Marge: A tattoo?
   Homer: A what?
   Bart:  Yeah, they're cool, and they last the rest of your life.
   Marge: You will &lt;not&gt; be getting a tattoo for Christmas.
   Homer: Yeah, if you want one, you'll have to pay for it out of your
          own allowance!
   -- Reading Bart's Christmas list, ``''

 Patty calls.  While Marge talks to her sister, Homer finishes installing
 the lights atop the house (falling to the lawn from the roof).  Homer
 tells Marge to ``turn on the juice'', and the lights light up, sort of.
 Most of the bulbs have burnt out.  ``Nice try, Dad,'' says Lisa.
 Ned plugs in his Christmas lights, and his house lights up in electronic
 opulence, complete with a Santa on the roof that says, ``Ho ho ho.''

 [End of Act One.  Time: 5:24]

 At the breakfast table, Marge tells the kids to get their money to go
 Christmas shopping.  Homer asks Marge where she's been hiding the Christmas
 money, and Marge isn't telling.  While Homer's back is turned, she fishes
 a huge jar of cash out of her hair.

 At the mall, Bart spots ``The Happy Sailor Tattoo Parlor''...

   Oh, Bart, that's so sweet.  It's the best present a mother could get,
   and it makes you look so dangerous.
   -- Marge in Bart's dream of getting a tattoo,
      ``''

 Bart heads inside.

   Bart:  One `mother' please.
   Clerk: Wait a minute.  How old are you?
   Bart:  Twenty-one, sir.
   Clerk: Get in the chair.
   -- Bart gets a tattoo, ``''

 Meanwhile, Homer checks the dials on a row of machines.  An announcement
 comes over the P.A. system.

   Smithers: Attention all personnel.  Please keep working during the
             following announcement.  And now, our boss and friend, Mr. Burns.
   Burns:    Hello.  I'm proud to announce that we've been able to increase
             safety here at the plant without increasing the cost to the consumer
             or affecting management pay raises.  However, for you semi-skilled
             workers, there will be no Christmas bonuses.  Oh, and one more
             thing:  Merry Christmas!
   -- ``''

 Marge finds Bart getting a tattoo and yanks him out of the shop.  Bart's
 incomplete tattoo reads, ``Moth.''  The doctor says that he can remove the
 tattoo with lasers, but he insists on a cash payment up front.  Marge
 notes, ``Thank God for Homer's Christmas bonus.''  The laser does its work.

 At home, Bart's arm is bandaged.

   Lisa:   [touches Bart's injured arm]
   Bart:   Ow!  Quit it.
   Lisa:   [touches Bart's injured arm]
   Bart:   Ow!  Quit it.
   Lisa:   [touches Bart's injured arm]
   Bart:   Ow!  Quit it.
   Maggie: [touches Bart's injured arm]
   Bart:   Ow!  Quit it.
   Homer:  [comes in]  Hey, what's with this?  [touches Bart's injured arm]
   Bart:   Ow!  Quit it.
   -- If I've told you once... `''

 Homer learns that Marge had to spend the Christmas money on getting the
 tattoo removed.  Homer cancels Christmas, but Marge says, ``We'll just
 have to stretch your Christmas bonus a little further this year.''
 Homer pretends he still has one then steps outside.  He watches
 Ned's extravagant Christmas lights and hangs his head.

 [End of Act Two.  Time: 8:58]

   Marge: [in bed, reading the shopping list]
          I get the feeling there's something you haven't told me Homer.
   Homer: Huh?  Oh, I love you Marge.
   Marge: Homer, you tell me that all the time.
   Homer: Oh good, because I &lt;do&gt; love you.
          I don't deserve you as much as a guy with a fat wallet and a credit
          card that won't set off that horrible beeping.
   Marge: Well, I think it does have something to do with your Christmas bonus.
          I keep asking for it, but...
   Homer: Marge...  Oh... Let me be honest with you...
   Marge: Yes?
   Homer: Well... I...
   Marge: [rubs his hand]
   Homer: I want to do the Christmas shopping this year!
   Marge: [hands over the list she was holding]  Well, sure.  Okay.
          [flicks bed-side light off. Homer's forced grin glows in the dark]
   -- Homer can't bear to tell Marge that his Christmas bonus has been cancelled,
      ``''

 Homer pays a visit to the Circus of Values (nothing over $4.99).
 He buys a six-pack of panty hose for Marge, pads of paper for Bart,
 and a squeak toy pork chop for Maggie.  (``It says it's for dogs, but
 she can't read.'')  On his way out, he bumps into Ned, laden with gifts.
 Their respective armfuls of goodies fall into the snow.

   Homer: [bumps into Ned.  Their respective armfuls of gifts fall into the snow]
   Ned:   Oh ho ho, Simpson, it's you.
   Homer: Hello, Flanders.
   Ned:   Oh my, what a little mess we've got here.  Well, which ones are yours
          and which ones are mine?
   Homer: Well, let's see.
   Ned:   [picking up gifts] Well, this one's mine, and this one's mine, heh heh,
          this one's mine, and...
   Homer: They're &lt;all&gt; yours!
   -- ``''

 All except the squeeze toy for Maggie.  (Squink, squink.)

 Homer is drinking at Moe's, and Barney comes in dressed as Santa.

   Barney: I got me a part-time job working as a Santa down at the mall.
   Homer:  Wow.  Can &lt;I&gt; do that?
   Barney: I dunno.  They're pretty selective.  [belch]
   -- ``''

 Homer applies.

   Manager: Do you like children?
   Homer:   What do you mean?  All the time?  Even when they're nuts??
   -- Homer applies for a job as a department store Santa,
      ``''

 [My audio dropped out for a bit.  Sorry.  I'm working from visuals here.]
 Homer attends Santa school.  They practice saying, ``Ho ho ho.''  Homer
 is asked to name Santa's reindeer...

   Dasher...  Dancer...  Prancer...  Nixon...
   -- Homer lists Santa's reindeer, ``''

 Homer practices talking to a boy on his lap.

 Homer returns home and greets Patty and Selma.  They are their usual
 non-cheery selves.  They note that there isn't a Christmas tree, andHomer
 says he was on his way out to get one.  He drives past signs that read
 ``All trees $75'', ``$60 and up'', ``Christmas trees, slightly irregular,
 $45'', heading instead for a sign that says, ``No trespassing.''  He
 chainsaws a tree and carries it to the car one step ahead of the guard
 dogs and gunfire.

 The kids are impressed.  Selma inquires after the birdhouse in the tree.
 ``Do I smell gunpowder?''

 At the mall, Homer plays Santa to a young boy and tells the child that
 he should be happy he has a good home and a loving father.  Homer steals
 a bite of the kid's donut.  Lewis, Bart, and Milhouse watch the pathetic
 Santa down below.  Milhouse dares Bart to yank his beard off.  Bart accepts
 the challenge.

   Bart:  Hey Santa, what's shakin', man?
   Homer: [as Santa]  What's your name, Bart...ner?  Uh, little partner?
   Bart:  I'm Bart Simpson, who the hell are you?
   -- Homer works as a department store Santa,
      ``''

 Bart yanks off Homer's beard, and Homer takes Bart aside.  He explains
 that he didn't get a bonus, but he'd do anything to keep the family from
 missing out on Christmas.

   You must really love us to sink so low.
   -- Bart admires Homer's working as a department store Santa,
      ``''

 Homer returns to work.

 Homer reaches the head of the paycheck line, to find that he's earned
 only $13.

   Homer: Thirteen bucks?  Hey, wait a minute.
   Clerk: That's right.  $120 gross, less Social Security...
   Homer: Yeah.
   Clerk: ... less unemployment insurance ...
   Homer: But...
   Clerk: ... less Santa training...
   Homer: Santa training?
   Clerk: ... less costume purchase...
   Homer: Wait a minute...
   Clerk: ... less beard rental...
   Homer: But...
   Clerk: ... less Christmas Club.
   Homer: But...
   Clerk: See you next year.  [closes the window]
   -- Paydirt, ``''

 Barney is on his way to Springfield Downs.  He's got a hot tip on a dog
 in the fourth race.  Whirlwind, a 12--1 shot.  Homer isn't so sure.

   Bart:  Aw come on, Dad.  This could be the miracle that saves the Simpsons'
          Christmas.  If TV has taught me anything, it's that miracles always
          happen to poor kids at Christmas.  It happened to Tiny Tim, it happened
          to Charlie Brown, it happened to the Smurfs, and it's going to happen
          to us!
   Homer: Well, okay, let's go.  Who's Tiny Tim?
   -- ``''

 [more audio dropout.  I really gotta get cable...]
 Lisa watches `The Happy Little Elves'.

 Homer, Bart, and Barney arrive at Springfield Downs.  In the fourth race,
 there's been a scratch.  The replacement is a dog named Santa's Little
 Helper.  Homer figures, with a name like that, it can't lose.  The odds
 are 99--1.  Bart isn't so sure that this is a great idea, but he
 reluctantly lends his support.

 Back at home, the Happy Little Elves are happy again, and Lisa is pleased.
 Patty bad-mouths Homer.

   Lisa:  What, Aunt Patty?
   Patty: Oh, nothing, dear.  I'm just trashing your father.
   Lisa:  Well, I wish you wouldn't because, aside from the fact that he has the
          same frailties as all human beings, he's the only father I have.
          Therefore, he is my model of manhood, and my estimation of him will
          govern the prospects of my adult relationships.
          So I hope you bear in mind that any knock at him is a knock at me,
          and I am far too young to defend myself against such onslaughts.
   Patty: Mm hm.  Go watch your cartoon show, dear.
   -- ``''

 The race is run, and SLH is dead last.  Way, way behind the rest of the pack.

   Don't worry, Dad.  Maybe this is just for suspense before the miracle happens.
   -- Bart's been watching too much TV, ``''

 Whirlwind wins.  SLH doesn't even make it to the finish line.

   It doesn't seem possible, but I guess TV has betrayed me.
   -- Bart, ``''

 Outside, Homer and Bart go through the discarded tickets in search of
 a winner.  Barney skids past, brandishing his winnings (and Daria).
 SLH's owner tells the dog to scram, and SLH leaps into Homer's arms.

   Bart:  Oh, Dad, can we keep him?
   Homer: But he's a loser!  He's pathetic!  He's...
   SLH:   [licks Homer's face]
   Homer: ... a Simpson.
   -- ``''

 Homer finally arrives home, and admits that he didn't get a bonus at all.
 Bart shows the family SLH, and Lisa is ecstatic.  ``So love at first
 sight &lt;is&gt; possible!''  Adds Bart, ``And if he runs away, he'll be easy
 to catch!''  Marge says it's the best gift of all, something to share
 their love, and frighten prowlers.  The tender moment is captured forever
 in a snapshot.

 [End of Act Three.  Time: 21:35]

 Over the closing credits, OFF sing a Christmas carol.

 EPISODE TITLE: Bart the Genius


EPISODE SUMMARY: 

   

 Maggie places an `E' block atop a teetering pile.  She admires her work,
 then in a flurry of arms, knocks them all down.  A Scrabble (tm) tile
 falls to the floor, and Lisa picks it up.  Pull back to reveal that the
 rest of the family are playing the classic word game.  Bart waits
 impatiently for Marge to make her move, and she does:  She places an `H'
 on the board to spell `HE'.  Now it's Homer's turn.  He grumbles, ``How
 can anyone make a word out of these lousy letters!''  Homer's rack contains
 the letters O-X-I-D-I-Z-E.  He decides to play the `D' to spell `DO'.
 Lisa places an `I' above the `D'...
   
   Lisa:  `Id', triple-word score!
   Homer: No abbreviations.
   Lisa;  Not I.D., Dad, `id'.  It's a word!
   Bart:  As in ``This game is stoop-id''.
   -- Playing Scrabble (tm), ``''
   
 Lisa reminds Bart that he's supposed to be building his vocabulary for
 tomorrow's aptitude test.  Marge suggests they check the dictionary, and
 Homer is surprised that they have one.  It's currently being used to
 prop up the couch.  Lisa looks up the word and confirms her score.
 Now it's Bart's turn.
   
   Bart:  Here we go.  Kwyjibo.   [places his tiles] K-W-Y-J-I-B-O.
          Twenty-two points, plus triple-word-score, plus fifty points
          for using all my letters.  Game's over.  I'm outta here. [gets up]
   Homer: [grabs Bart with his left hand, holding a banana in his right]
          Wait a minute, you little cheater!
          You're not going anywhere until you tell me what a kwyjibo is.
   Bart:  Kwyjibo.  Uh... a big, dumb, balding North American ape.  With no chin.
   Marge: And a short temper.
   Homer: I'll show you a big, dumb, balding ape! [leaps for Bart]
   Bart:  [making his escape]  Uh oh.  Kwyjibo on the loose!
   -- Playing Scrabble (tm), ``''
   
 Springfield Elementary School, before the morning bell.  Kids on the
 playground, doing standard things.  Playing marbles.  Skipping rope.
 Playing some combination of kickball and dodgeball.  Spraying graffiti.
 Spraying graffiti?  Oh, it's Bart, completing a ``I am a weiner [sic]''
 of Principal Skinner.

 Martin squeals on Bart.  Milhouse warns Bart, who quickly discards his
 can of spraypaint.
   
   Pr.Sk:  Whoever did this is in very deep trouble.
   Martin: And a sloppy speller, too.
           The preferred spelling of `weiner' is W-&lt;I&gt;-&lt;E&gt;-N-E-R,
           although E-I is an acceptable ethnic variant.
   Pr.Sk:  Good point.
   -- Either way, he's still a weiner.  ``''
   
 Skinner orders the kids to show their hands, and Bart is literally caught
 red-handed.  Skinner schedules a chat with Bart.  The usual time and place.
 (Skinner's office, after school.)

 The bell rings, and the kids file in.  Martin asks Bart not to hold a
 grudge; he was merely protecting school property.  Bart responds, ``Eat
 my shorts.''  Ms. Krabappel hands out the IQ tests.
   
   Now I don't want you to worry, class.  These test will have no effect on your
   grade.  They merely determine your future social status and financial success.
   [looks at Bart]  If any.
   -- Ms. Krabappel administers an IQ test, ``''
   
 Martin reminds Ms. Krabappel that Bart is supposed to turn his desk towards
 the window so he can't cheat.
   
   Remember to visualize the complex problem.
   And relaaaaax.  The test will start... [looks around calmly]  [yells] Now!
   -- Ms. Krabappel administers an IQ test, ``''
   
 Pencils hit paper.
   
   Bart: [reading a test question]
         The 7:30am express train travelling at 60 miles an hour leaves Santa Fe
         bound for Phoenix, [chews on his pencil] 520 miles away.
   Ms.K: Shhh!  [points to her head]  Visualize it, Bart!
   Bart: [visualizing in black-and-white]  At the same time, the local train
         travelling 30 miles an hour and carrying 40 passengers leaves Phoenix
         bound for Santa Fe.  It is eight cars long and always carries the
         same number of passengers in each car.  [Bart counts five passengers on
         the train car (the number hovering over each passenger's head)
         and visualizes 40 / 8 = 5.  The train travels through a numerical
         landscape.]
         An hour later, a number of passengers equal to half the number of
         minutes past the hour get off, and three times as many plus six
         get on.  [Bart and his equation are trampled by the passengers.]
         At the second stop, half the passengers plus two get off, but twice
         as many get on as got on at the first stop.  [Trampled again.
         Bart spits out a number.]
   Train conductor:  Ticket, please.
   Bart: I don't have a ticket!
   Train conductor:  Come with me, boy.
         [drags Bart off.  Numbers circle Bart's head]
         We've got a stowaway, sir.
   Bart: I'll pay!  How much?
         [the train engineer is... Martin!  Shoveling numbers into the engine.]
   Martin: Twice the fare from Tuscon to Flagstaff minus two thirds of the fare
         Albuquerque to El Paso!  Ha-ha-ha-ha!!!!!
   -- Math is Hell, ``''
   
 The two trains crash into each other, throwing Bart into the air...

 ... and onto his back on the classroom floor.  Ms. Krabappel tells Bart
 to stop distracting the others, but Martin isn't distracted.  In fact,
 he's finished.  Ms. Krabappel lets Martin go outside and read under a
 tree.

 Bart returns to his seat and exchanges faces with Martin through the
 window.
   
   What are you looking at, Bart!  Are those naughty dogs back again?
   -- Ms. Krabappel catches Bart staring out the window, ``''
   
 While Ms. Krabappel looks outside, Bart grabs Martin's test, changes
 the name to `Bart Simpson' and replaces it.  He then writes `Martin
 Prince' on his own sheet and fills in the dots randomly.

 Marge and Homer walk through the schoolyard.  Marge maintains that Bart
 is merely a sheep that has strayed from the fold and needs to be hugged
 extra hard.  Homer answers, ``That's exactly the kind of crapola that's
 lousing him up!''  Homer is impressed by Bart's graffito.

 Marge and Homer reach the principal's office.
   
   Pr.Sk: I caught your son defacing school property this morning.
          We estimate the damage is $75, and frankly, we think it's terribly
          unfair that other taxpayers should foot the bill.
   Homer: Yeah, it's a crummy system, but what are you going to do?
   Marge: [whispers to Homer]
   Homer: Oh no.  He can't mean that.  [to Principal Skinner]
          My wife thinks you want &lt;me&gt; to pay for it.
   Pr.Sk: That &lt;was&gt; the idea.
   Homer: Oh.
   -- ``''
   
 While Homer writes out a check, Principal Skinner shows them a
 sloppily-scrawled absence note which reads ``Please excuse Bart.
 He was sick.  Homer Simpson.''  But he changes his assessment of
 the note as a forgery when he sees Homer's handwriting on the check...

 In comes Dr. J. Loren Pryor, district psychiatrist...
   
   What do &lt;we&gt; need a psychiatrist for?  We know our kid is nuts.
   -- Homer, ``''
   
 Dr. Pryor informs all that Bart is, believe it or not, a genius.
   
   Dr.J:  The child is not supposed to know his own IQ, of course, but
          as you can see, it's beyond the range of any doubt.
          [hands Homer a slip of paper]
   Homer: Nine hundred and twelve!!?!?
   Dr.J:  Uh, no.  You have it upside-down.  It's two hundred and sixteen.
   Homer: [disappointed] Oh.
   -- ``''
   
   Dr.J: [measuring Bart's head with calipers]
         Tell me, Bart, are you ever bored in school?
   Bart: Oh, you bet.
   Dr.J: Mm hm.  Do you ever feel a little frustrated?
   Bart: All the time, sir.
   Dr.J: Uh huh.  And do you ever dream of leaving class to pursue your own
         intellectual development on an independent basis?
   Bart: Oh, like you're reading my mind, man.
   -- Great minds think alike, ``''
   
 Dr. Pryor explains that when a genius is forced to slow down to that of
 a `normal' person, he tends to lash out (indicates Bart's disciplinary
 folder).
   
   Pr.Sk: I think we should re-test him.
   Dr.J:  No, I think we should move him to another school.
   Pr.Sk: Even better!
   -- Bart is identified as a genius, ``''
   
 Dr. Pryor suggests that Bart enroll in a school for the gifted, where there
 are no rules, no homework, nothing to stifle intellectual creativity.
 Bart's eyes open wide and he eagerly accepts.
   
   Homer: My son, a genius!?  How does it happen?
   Dr.J:  Well, genius, like intelligence, is usually the result of heredity
          and environment.
   Homer: [stares blankly]
   Dr.J:  Although in some cases, it's a total mystery.
   -- ``''
   
 [End of Act One.  Time: 8:04]

 At the breakfast table, Bart squirms as Marge combs down his hair.  Once
 she's gone, he musses it back up.  Homer suggests Bart wear a tie (since
 all boy geniuses wear ties), but Bart refuses to let it stifle his
 creativity.
   
   Marge: It's a big day for you.  Why don't you eat something a little more
          nutritious.
   Homer: Nonsense, Marge.  Frosty Krusty Flakes is what got him where he
          is today!  [looks at the box]  It must be one of these chemicals
          here that makes him so smart...  Lisa?
   Lisa:  [looks up from her granola]
   Homer: Maybe you should try some of this.
   Marge: Homer!
   Homer: I'm just saying, why not have &lt;two&gt; geniuses in the family?
          Sort of a spare, in case Bart's brain blows up.
   -- First day of genius school, ``''
   
 Lisa tells Bart, despite the testing, she still insists he's a dimwit.
 Bart replies, ``&lt;This&gt; dimwit is on easy street.''

 On the drive to the Enriched Learning Center for Gifted Children, Bart
 tells Homer to take the scenic route.  They finally arrive, and Bart
 discovers that all the boys are wearing neckties.
   
   Bart:  Oh no, ties!
   Homer: Don't worry, son, you can have mine.
          Here, let me show you how to put on a tie.
          [takes off his clip-on]
          The hook goes over the top, and these things go in there.
   -- ``''
   
 Homer kisses Bart.
   
   Now go on, boy, and pay attention.  Because if you do, someday, you may
   achieve something that we Simpsons have dreamed about for generations:
   You may outsmart someone!
   -- Homer drops Bart off at the Enriched Learning Center for Gifted Children,
      ``''
   
 Homer shoves Bart into the classroom, where Ms. Mellon [pron. /mel-LON/]
 introduces him around.  They have only one rule:  Make your own rules.
 ``If you feel sleepy, take a nap.  If you get bored, feel free to take
 out a book and start reading.''  Bart sifts through the shelf and discovers
 a Radioactive Man comic.  Ms. Mellon tosses it into the trash, but Bart
 fishes it back out.

 Bart is introduced to his classmates.  Ethan speaks in palindromes.
 (``O Memsahib, Bart.  Rabbi has memo.'')  Sidney speaks in backwards
 phonetics.  (``Trabing norm doog!'')  Bart reacts appropriately.
 Cecile is performing a virus experiment on hamsters.
 (``I wouldn't get too attached, Bart.  We're dissecting him next week.'')

 Class begins.  Ms. Mellon invites everyone to greet Bart (and they do,
 in assorted foreign languages).  They continue yesterday's discussion on
 the existence of free will, and Ian's contribution sparks Ms. Mellon to
 ask the class for examples of paradoxes.  Hands go up, save one.
   
   Ms.M: Bart, what other paradoxes affect our lives?
   Bart: [looks around nervously; all stare at him]
         Well, you're damned if you do, and you're damned if you don't.

 Lunchtime.  Bart is swindled out of his lunch by the other students.

 [End of Act Two.  Time: 12:36]

 Bart sits on his bed sipping a soda and reading a Radioactive Man comic.
 Homer comes in and offers to celebrate Bart's first day at genius school
 with a round of frosty chocolate milkshakes.  Marge and Lisa pop by.
   
   Marge: Bart, I feel so bad for going so many years without... mmm...
          mmm... What's that word where you encourage something to grow?
   Bart+Homer: [stare blankly and hum ``I dunno'']
   Lisa:  [brightly] Nurturing.
   Marge: ... nurturing your brilliant brain.
   -- ``''
   
   Marge: I got tickets to the opera tonight.  Hurry up, get dressed,
          it starts at eight.
   Bart:  [whining] Oh, Mom, not tonight...
   Homer: Come on, Bart.  Your mother's only trying to help, so go ahead
          and enjoy the show.
   Marge: Homer, you're going, too.
   Homer: But I'm not a genius!  Why should &lt;I&gt; suffer!?
   -- ``''
   
 Marge bought an expensive box.  Bart tells Lisa to keep an eye out for
 the guy selling peanuts.  The overture begins...
   
   Toreador, oh, don't spit on the floor.                                  \\
   Please use the cuspador.                                                \\
   That's what it's for.
   -- Bart at the opera, ``''
   
   Marge: Bart, stop fooling around!
          Homer, stop encouraging him.
   Homer: Don't stifle the boy, Marge.  We're &lt;supposed&gt; to encourage him.
   -- At the opera, ``''
   
 The opera continues.  Homer and Bart get bored and make snoring noises.
   
   Homer: Who's the lard-butt?
   Lisa:  He's the bullfighter.
   Bart:  No way the bull's going to miss a target that big!
   -- At the opera, ``''
   
 Homer and Bart make flatulent noises.  Marge just covers her face.

 Homer grows impatient, but Bart reminds him, ``It ain't over 'til the
 fat lady sings.''  Homer asks, ``Is that one fat enough for you, son?''
 Homer stands up.  ``Let's go get a burger.''

 Back at school...
   
   Ms. M: So \math y = r^3/3 \math.  And if you determine the rate of change
          in this curve correctly, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.
   Class: [chuckles]
   Ms. M: Don't you get it, Bart?  Derivative \math dy = 3 r^2 / 3 \math,
          or \math r^2 dr \math, or \math r\,dr\,r\math.
          Har-de-har-har, get it?
   Bart:  [not amused]  Oh, yeah.  [forced laugh]
   -- Making math fun, ``''
   
 Bart trudges home and walks past his graffito, now roped off and
 tagged, ``The Principal.  By Bart Simpson.  IQ 216.''  Bart tries
 to join his friends, but they don't want anything to do with him.

 Bart glumly eats dinner.  Marge calls to Bart and Homer, ``Come on, you
 two.  Don't forget the film festival!''  She and Lisa leave.  Homer
 apologizes, ``Sorry, Bart.  Your mother bought us tickets for a student
 movie by some Swedish meatball.''  Bart tries to confess, but Homer
 suggests they play catch, which they do into the night.  ``So what was
 it you wanted to tell me, son?''  ``Uh, nuthin' Pop.''

 Chemistry class.  Ms. Mellon is unable to find a lab partner for Bart,
 who is busy mixing and matching.  She asks what he's doing, and Bart
 explains that ``it's really top secret, man.''  Ms. Mellon asks, ``But
 you &lt;do&gt; know what happens when you mix acids and bases, right?''
 Bart responds, ``Of course I do.''  He mixes.

 Cut to exterior of the ELCfGC.  The entire top floor overflows with
 green goo.  Back inside, everyone is coated in goo.  Bart: ``Sorry.''
 Cecile's hamster escapes.

 Bart (still covered in green) is called into Dr. Pryor's office.  The
 good doctor wants to know what the matter is.
   
   It doesn't take a Bart Simpson to figure out that something's wrong.
   -- Dr. J. Loren Pryor, ``''
   
 He asks what he can do, and Bart wants to return to his old class.
 Undercover.  ``I could pretend to be a regular, dumb kid.''  He
 can then study them to ``see what makes them tick''.  Dr. Pryor
 leaves to discuss the matter with Principal Skinner, and asks Bart
 to write up his proposal.  Bart tries to write a proposal, but fails,
 so he instead writes his confession.

 Dr. Pryor returns and reads the proposal.  ``You know, you misspelled
 `confession'.''

 Bart returns home (still coated in green) and explains that he had a
 little accident in chemistry class.  Homer takes Bart outside to wash
 it off with turpentine.
   
   I bet Einstein turned himself all sorts of colors
   before he invented the light bulb.
   -- Homer, ``''
   
 Bart confesses, but adds that ``the past few weeks have been great.''
 He tenderly lists the things the two have done together and concludes,
 ``I love you, Dad.  And I think if something can bring us that close,
 it can't possibly be bad.''

 Pause.

 ``Why you little!!!!!!!''

 Bart makes his escape (naked) through the house (``I think Bart's stupid
 again, Mom,'' remarks Lisa) and locks himself in his room.  Homer pounds
 the door as Bart hops onto his bed, grabs a soda, and reads a comic book.
 Homer tries to sweet-talk Bart out, but Bart catches on.  ``You think
 I'm dumb enough to fall for that?  I'm insulted.''  After a ``D'oh!'',
 Homer resumes his pounding, with even more force than before.

 EPISODE TITLE: Homer's Odyssey


EPISODE SUMMARY: 

   

 The students are on the front lawn of Springfield Elementary.
   
   Ms. K: [blows whistle]  Now class, I don't want this field trip to be a
          repeat of our infamous visit to the Springfield State Prison.  So
          I want you all to be on your best behavior.  Especially you,
          Bart Simpson.
   Bart:  Mrs. Krabappel, I didn't unlock that door!
   -- It was like that when I got there!  ``''
   
 The school bus arrives, screeching to a halt on the sidewalk.
 Otto is visibly hung-over.
   
   Oooh, sorry little dudes.  Party hearty equals tardy.
   -- Otto, ``''
   
 The kids file onto the bus, except for Bart, who chats with Otto.
   
   Bart: Hey Otto!  Hey Otto-man!
   Otto: Hey Bart-dude!
   Bart: Any new tattoos, Otto?
   Otto: Ho!  Funny you should ask, man.  This morning I woke up
         with this one.  [lifts his sleeve]
   Bart: Cooool!  I want one!
   Otto: Not till your fourteen, my little friend.
   Bart: [forlorn look]
   -- Good things come to those who wait, ``''
   
 Mrs. Krabappel orders Bart onto the bus.  The last available seat is
 next to Wendell, who pukes on every bus ride.
   
   Please try not to shake the seat like that.
   -- Wendell rides on the school bus, ``''
   
   Ms. K: Now class, remember, do not stick any part of your body out the
          window.  We all know the tragic story of the young man who stuck
          his arm out the window and had it ripped off by a big truck
          coming in the other direction.
   Bart:  [arm tucked inside his shirt]  And I was that fool!
   -- ``''
   
 With a crunch of the bus gears, they're on their way.  ``Oh-oh, I don't
 feel so hot,'' moans Wendell.

 They drive past the toxic waste dump (waving their arms out the
 window), the tire yard, the state prison, Springfield Elementary School...
   
   Lewis: Look, there's our school again!
   Ms. K: Otto, are you sure you...
   Otto:  It's a shortcut Mrs. K, trust me!
   -- Field trip, ``''
   
 Wendell doesn't look too hot, and Bart waves his arms frantically.
   
   Bart:   Mrs. Krabappel, Mrs. Krabappel!
   Ms. K:  Bart!  Not another word out of you, or I'll subject you to the
           humiliation of making you sing in front of the class.
   Bart:   Can I pick the song?
   Ms. K:  No!  The song will be `John Henry Was a Steel Driving Man'.
   Bart:   [moans] Oh no.  [zips his mouth shut]
   Sherry: We're gonna make you sing, Bart Simpson.
   Terry:  Yeah, Bart Simpson, we're gonna make you sing.
           [they consult privately, giggle, then both lean over the
           bus seat and kiss Bart]
   Bart:   Waaaaaaaaauuuuuuuuuuuuuuuugh!
   Ms. K:  That's it Bart!  Oh, why can't you be more like...  uh... uh... uh...
   S+T:    [raising their hands] Us, Mrs. Krabappel?
   Otto:   Yeah... Sherry and Terry, they know how to behave.
   S+T:    [halos appear over their heads as they sit angelically on the bus]
   -- ``''
   
 As the bus pulls into the nuclear power plant...
   
   Bart:  Da-da, da da-da, DA, Whoa!
    :     They took Bart Simpson to the graveyard. [ungh]
    :     And buried him in the sand.  (oh yeah)
    :     And every locomotive that came rollin' by|
   Ms. K: Bart!
   Bart:                                           |said
    :     There lies a steel-driving man,|
   Ms. K: Bart!
   Bart:                                 |(lord lord, ooh)
    :     There lies a steel...
   Ms.K: Okay, Bart, that's enough!
   -- Bart sings as punishment, ``''
   
 The bus comes to a stop, and Bart gives Wendell a congratulatory slap
 on the back for making through the entire bus ride without throwing up.
 Cut to the exterior of the bus as we hear (*splort*) and see the kids
 escaping out the windows and emergency exit.  The kids file right past
 a security kiosk.  The guard takes absolutely no notice of them.

 In the auditorium, the class is introduced to the wonders of nuclear energy.
 Smithers is their guide.  ``And so this plant harnesses the power of the
 atom so that we have energy to run everything from your favorite video
 games to yummy cotton candy machines  [class applause]  Ha ha, let's learn
 more about nuclear energy shall we?  Lights!''

 The kids are shown one of those lousy 16mm educational films ``NUCLEAR
 ENERGY, our misunderstood friend''.
   
   Narrator:  When most people think of nuclear energy, they think of this...
   A-Bomb:    BOOM!  [the kids cheer wildly]
   -- Nuclear Energy, our misunderstood friend, ``''
   
 ``But when we mean nuclear energy, we mean this.''  A Jetson-like
 family enjoys their electrical appliances.  ``But what exactly is nuclear
 energy?  I don't know, but I know someone who does, Smilin' Joe Fission.''

 Smilin' Joe Fission speaks with a Texas accent.  ``Hi there energy eaters!''
 SJF introduces the rods of U235, which are hot due to radioactivity.  So
 they go for a dip in the pool.  ``Last one in is a rotten rod!''  The water
 becomes so hot, it boils.  The rods yelp, ``Ouch, ouch!''  The steam
 generated is used to turn turbines and produce electricity.
   
   Uh-oh.  Looks like there's a little left-over nuclear waste.
   [pulls out a hand broom]  No problem!
   I'll just put them where nobody will find them for a million years!
   [sweeps the wasties under a throw rug and stomps them down]
   -- Smilin' Joe Fission, ``''
   
 One of the wasties escapes, and SJF kicks him aside.  (``Ow!'')

 After the end of the film, Smithers opens the steel doors and takes
 the children through the plant.  ``To your right if you'll look
 through this window, is where our water rejoins the rest of nature's
 biosphere.''
   
   Sherry: Hey Bart!  Our dad says your dad is incompetent.
   Bart:   What does incompetent mean?
   Terry:  It means he spends more time yacking and scarfing down donuts than
           doing his job.
   Bart:   Oh, okay.  I thought you where putting me down.
   -- ``''
   
 Homer meanwhile is yacking and scarfing down donuts.
   
   Ya know, I defy anyone to tell the difference between these donuts and
   ones baked today!
   -- Homer enjoys some donuts, ``''
   
 He asks if anyone has seen the kids on their field trip and decides
 to ``go where the action is'' in a go-cart.  Bart calls out to him while
 he drives past.  Distracted, Homer collides with a pipe from the reactor.
   
   Supervisor:  All right, who's responsible for this?
                [everyone points at Homer]
   Homer:       [meekly raises his hand]
   Supervisor:  I might have known it was you, Simpson.
   Homer:       But sir, I...
   Supervisor:  I don't want to hear about it Simpson, your fired!
                [looks up to catwalk]
                Oh, hi, girls!
   Sherry+Terry: [waving]  Hi, Daddy!
   -- ``''
   
 [End of Act One.  Time: 6:27]

 At breakfast, Lisa helps search through the classifieds.
   
   Lisa:  Here's a good job at the fireworks factory.
   Homer: Those perfectionists, forget it.
   Lisa:  How about this, a supervising technician at the toxic waste dump.
   Homer: I'm no supervising technician, I'm a technical supervisor.
   -- ``''
   
   There there, Homer.  You'll find a job.  You've caused plenty of
   industrial accidents, and you've always bounced back.
   -- Marge, ``''
   
 With the encouragement of the kids, Homer goes job-hunting.
 But everyone he approaches literally slams the door in his face.
 Wait a second, that last door was the Simpsons front door.
 The door opens.  Bart says, ``Don't give up Dad.''  He shuts it again.

 At Moe's Tavern...
   
   I'm just a technical supervisor who cared too much.
   -- Homer bemoans his lost job, ``''
   
 The phone rings.
   
   Bart:  Is Mister Freely there?
   Moe:   Who?
   Bart:  Freely, first initials I. P.
   Moe:   Hold on, I'll check.  Uh, is I. P. Freely here?
          Hey everybody, I. P. Freely!
          [the customers laugh]
          Wait a minute...  Listen to me you lousy bum. When I get a
          hold of you, you're dead. I swear I'm gonna slice your heart in half.
   -- ``''
   
 Moe refuses to credit Homer another drink.  He explains why:
 ``I don't think your ever going to get another job and be able to
 pay me back.''

 Homer is unable to sleep.
   
   Marge:  Are you all right, Homer?
   Homer:  I'm fine, I'm just thinking.
   Marge:  I've been thinking, too.  You know Homer, you've always been such a
           good provider... but when we got married, even Mr. Burger promised I
           could come back to my old job any time I wanted.
   Homer:  You think you can still do that line of work?
   Marge:  Sure, you never forget.  It's just like riding a bicycle.
    :      [at a drive-in restaurant]
   Otto:   Hey Momma, where's my fries already!
    :      [Marge skates in, somewhat annoyed]
   -- ``''
   
 Back at home, Homer lies unshaven on the couch.
   
   Lisa:   Dad!  Eat something!  [holds up a sandwich] It's got mustard on it.
    :      [Homer's eye view of the ceiling]
    :      [Bart leans in and waves his hand.  Lisa also leans in.]
   Bart:   All he does is lie there like an unemployed whale.
   Lisa:   I don't know what else to do.
   Maggie: [pokes Homer in the eye.  The picture fuzzes.]
   Bart:   There's only one thing we can do... take advantage of the old
           guy.  You've gotta sign my report card, Dad.
           [Bart takes Homer's hand and scrawls his name]
   -- ``''
   
 Time passes...
   
   TV Announcer:  Loaf-time, the cable network for the unemployed, will be
           back with more tips on how to win the lottery right after this.
   Duff Beer commercial:  Unemployed?  Out of work?  Sober?  You sat
           around the house all day, but now it's Duff time!  Duff, the beer
           that makes the days fly by!
   Homer:  Beer.  Now there's a temporary solution.
   -- ``''
   
   Beer.  Now there's a temporary solution.
   -- Homer, ``''
   
 Homer searches the fridge.  He pulls out a box, but it contains a cake
 which reads, ``Don't worry, Daddy, we love you anyway!''  Homer discards
 the cake, ``Damn!  I need money!''  Homer sneaks into Bart's bedroom
 and carefully snags the piggy bank without waking his son.
   
   [smashes open Bart's piggy bank with a hammer]
   Oh no!  What have I done?  I smashed open my little boy's piggy bank,
   and for what?  A few measly cents, not even enough to buy one beer.
   Wait a minute, lemme count and make sure... [counts] not even close.
   -- Homer, ``''
   
 He reaches for the notepaper.  (``Dumb things I gotta do today''.)
 ``Dear Family.  I am an utter failure, and you'll be better off
 without me.  By the time you read this, I will be in my watery
 grave.  I can only leave you with the words my father gave me:
 Stand tall, have courage, and never give up.  I only hope I can
 provide a better model, in death than I did in life.  Warmest
 regards...''  He scratches that last part out.
 ``Love, Homer J. Simpson.''

 Homer takes one last look at the house.  With a rock tied to his
 waist, Homer heads out the gate (which he oils to keep the family
 from hearing the creaking) makes his way up the road.
 ``Nothing's easy'' he says to himself.

 [End of Act Two.  Time: 11:50]
   
   Mrs. Winfield:  Looks like young Simpson is going to kill himself.
   Mr. Winfield:   Oh, maybe not.
                   Maybe he's just taking his boulder for a walk.
   -- Homer walks down the street with a rock tied to his waist,
      ``''
   
 The kids wake Marge thinking the house has been burgled.  Bart's
 piggy-bank and their father are missing.  Lisa finds the note.

 A speeding car almost knocks Homer over as he crosses the road.
 ``Hey, buddy!  Watch where you're going!''  He arrives at the bridge,
 and finds there a boulder just like the one he's been carrying.
 Bart calls out ``Don't do it, Dad!'', and Homer saves his family
 just in time from a speeding van.
   
   Homer:  Boy!  This intersection is dangerous.  Someone oughta put a
           stop sign here.  [a beam of sunlight graces Homer's face]
   Marge:  Oh, Homer, how could think of killing yourself?  We love you.
   Lisa:   Yeah, Dad, we love you.
   Bart:   Yeah!
    :      [during Homer's speech, the sun rises slowly in the distance]
   Homer:  Kill myself?  Killing myself is the last thing I'd ever do.  Now
           I have a purpose, a reason to live.  I don't care who I have to
           face, I don't care who I have to fight, I will not rest until
           this street gets a stop sign!
   -- ``''
   
 At City Hall...
   
   Chief Wiggum:  Well it's no secret.  Our city is under siege by a
          graffiti vandal known as El Barto.  Police artists have a
          composite sketch of the culprit.  If anyone has any information,
          please contact us immediately.
   Bart:  [looking at the `Wanted' poster that shares only a slight resemblance]
          Cool man!

 Homer's submission for the council is next.
   
   Homer:  Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed councilmen, boys and girls,
           retired people with nothing better to do.  Danger comes in many,
           many forms, from the dinosaurs that tormented our caveman
           ancestors, to the...
   Esteemed Councilman:  Simpson!  Get to the point.
   Homer:  I think we should put a stop sign on D Street and Twelfth.  The
           other...
   Councilman:  All in favor [unanimously with the other councilmen] Aye.
           Approved, Meeting adjourned.
   -- ``''
   
   If they think I'm going to stop at that stop sign, they're sadly mistaken!
   -- Homer becomes safety-conscious, ``''
   
 Homer makes the headlines.

 In the park, Marge and the kids pride themselves with what
 Homer's accomplished... but he's not so sure.
   
   Homer:  But come on, we all know this is small potatoes.  There's a
           danger in this town that is bigger than all the Dips put together.
   Lisa:   What, Dad?
   Homer:  I'm talking about &lt;that&gt;!  [points at the SNPP]
   Marge:  You mean your going to pick on your old bosses?
   Lisa:   Wow!
   Bart:   Gee, Dad's a hero.
   Homer:  Whadja say, son?
   Bart:   Nuthin'.
   Homer:  That's ok, I'll just assume you said what I thought I heard you say.

   Unlike most of you, I am not a nut.

 Surveyed from above...
   
   Burns:    Look at that man, he has the crowd in the palm of his hand.  I
             haven't seen anything like it since Jolson.  [to Smithers]
             Who is he?
   Smithers: That's Homer Simpson, sir.  He used to work here in the plant,
             but we fired him for gross incompetence.
   Burns:    Ah, so that's his little game.  Get this Simpson character up here
             right now.
   Smithers: But Mr. Burns!
   Burns:    I said do it, now DO IT, DO IT, DO IT!
   -- ``''
   
 Homer addresses the crowd.
   
   Your lives are in the hands of men no smarter than you or I,
   many of them incompetent boobs.
   I know this because I worked alongside them,
   gone bowling with them,
   watched them pass me over for promotions time and again.
   And I say... This stinks!
   -- Homer leads a demonstration at the SNPP, ``''
   
   Smithers:  Hey, Simpson, Burns wants to talk to you privately.
   Homer:     [still speaking through the megaphone] Privately?
   -- Homer leads a demonstration at the SNPP, ``''
   
 He tells the crowd, ``Stay here.  I'll be right back.''

 Homer is brought to Burns' office.
   
   Ah, Homer Simpson, at last we meet.
   -- Monty Burns' famous words, ``''
   
 Monty makes a generous offer.
   
   Burns: Hear me out Simpson!  I don't want you to come back as a technical
          supervisor, or supervising technician, or whatever the hell you
          used to be.  I want you to be in charge of safety here at the plant.
   Homer: Safety?  But sir!  If truth be known, I actually caused more
          accidents around here than any other employee,  [leaning forward]
          including a few doozies no one every found out about.
   -- ``''
   
 The offer expires in thirty seconds.  Burns starts an hourglass.
   
   Homer: [thinking to himself] Me in charge of safety?
          This place could blow sky-high.
          Naah, I'll concentrate on my work now.
          Hey, this guy's desk sure is big.
          I can't let Marge support the family!
          This guy's got the cleanest shirt I've ever seen.
          What should I...
   Burns: Simpson!  Time's up.
   Homer: What the hay, I'll take the job.
   -- A carefully-thought-out decision, ``''
   
 ``Your first duty would be to step out on the balcony, and tell
 that crowd this plant is safe.''

 Homer goes out onto the balcony.  ``This plant is...''  His family look
 up at him.  ``Oh... sit tight, I'll be right back.''  The crowd cheers.
 Homer turns back into the office.
   
   Burns: You mean you're willing to give up a good job and a raise, just
          for your principles?
   Homer: Hmmmm, you put it that way it does sound a little far-fetched,
          but that's the lug your looking at... and I vow to continue

 EPISODE TITLE: There's No Disgrace Like Home


EPISODE SUMMARY: 

   

 Bart and Lisa are in the dining room fighting, shoving each other in the
 shoulder.
   
   Bart:   Yeah?|     |Oh yeah?|     |Yeah?|     |Oh &lt;yeah&gt;?|
   Lisa:        |Yeah!|        |Yeah!|     |Yeah!|          |Yeah!
   Homer:  [runs into the room, picks both kids up by the collar]
           Hey!  What's the problem here?
   Lisa:   We were fighting over which one of us loves you more.
   Homer:  [touched]  You were?  [sniff]  Aww... Well, go ahead.
           [releases the kids]
   Bart:   You love him more.|      |No I don't!|             |&lt;No I don't!&gt;
   Lisa:                  |No, &lt;you&gt; do!|       |Yes you &lt;do&gt;!|
   -- ``''
   
 Homer threatens the kids to get it out of their system.  ``I don't want
 you embarrassing me at my boss's picnic.''  Homer enters the kitchen and
 inspects a hugenormous mixture of green jelly and marshmallows.
   
   Mmmmm.... marshmallows...
   -- Homer admires Marge's gelatinous dessert, ``''
   
 After helping himself (and belching), he earns a scolding from Marge.
   
   Homer:  Are you sure that's enough?
           You know how the boss loves your delicious gelatin desserts!
   Marge:  Oh Homer, Mr. Burns just said he liked it... [indicates with her
           finger]  Once.
   Homer:  Marge, that's the only time he's ever spoke to me without using the
           word...  [dejectedly]  Bonehead.
   -- ``''
   
 Everyone is in the car with a plate of delicious gelatin dessert on their
 laps.

 On arrival, the family (save Marge) carry the plates above their heads.
 Homer sets some ground rules with the kids.
   
   Homer:  Okay, now look.  My boss is going to be at this picnic, so I want
           you to show your father some love and/or respect.
   Lisa:   Tough choice.
   Bart:   I'm picking respect.
   -- ``''
   
 Mr. Burns welcomes the Gammel family.  When Gammel Jr.\ complains about
 missing little league, the father kindly tells his son to be quiet.
   
   Burns:    Oh please please, don't fight.  Just go out back and have a good
             time.  [to Smithers]  Fire that man Smithers, I don't want him, or
             his unpleasant family to ruin my picnic.
   Smithers: He'll be gone by the tug-of-war sir.
   Burns:    Excellent.
   -- ``''
   
 The Simpsons arrive.
   
   Homer:    Ah, afternoon Mr. Burns!
   Burns:    Hello there... uh... uh...
   Homer:    [whispers to Smithers]  Simpson, Homer.
   Smithers: [hands an index card to Burns]  Here you go, sir.
   Burns:    Ah!  Oh yes... [reads the card]  Oh, and this must be your lovely
             wife... Marge.
   Marge:    [smiles]
   Burns:    Ho ho, look at little... uh... [consults the card]  Lisa!  Why,
             she's growing like a weed.
             And this must be... uh, Brat!
   Brat:     [unimpressed]  Bart.
   Homer:    Don't correct the man, Brat!
   -- ``''
   
 Homer presents their delicious gelatin dessert.
   
   Oh, for the love of Peter!
   -- Monty Burns utters a frustrated expletive, ``''
   
 It seems that ``some damned fool went around telling everyone that I loved
 that slimy goop!''  He instructs them to ``toss it on the pile over there,''
 indicating several rooms already filled with gelatinous dessert.
   
   Burns:  Make yourselves at home.
   Bart:   Hear that Dad?  You can lie around in your underwear and scratch
           yourself.
   Homer:  [angrily, he goes to strangle Bart]  Now you listen to me!
   Burns:  Trouble, Simpson?
   Homer:  [one hand around Bart's neck]  No, heh heh heh.  Just congratulating
           the son on a fine joke about his old man.  [nervously pats Bart's
           head]
   -- ``''
   
 Out the back of the estate, Homer stresses the importance of proper conduct
 with Bart and Lisa.
   
   Homer:  Now, remember!  As far as anyone knows, we're a nice, normal family.
   Lisa:   Hey Bart!  Last one in the fountain's a rotten egg!
   Homer:  D'oh!  [chasing after the two]  Be normal!  Be normal!
   -- ``''
   
 One of the other mothers recommends that they dump their adorable girls in
 the nursery and get a glass of punch, but Marge admits to not being much of
 drinker.  ``Is that your boy there torturing a swan?''  Marge suggests
 a glass of punch.  Homer is still chasing after Bart and Lisa (who
 is hiding in the fountain).  The two mothers enter a room where a group of
 small children are playing.
   
   Marge:   Do you think we should leave the kids unsupervised?
   Mother:  You're right.  [turns on the TV]
   -- ``''
   
 Outside, Homer continues his search for Bart and Lisa.  Lisa has disguised
 herself as a fountain cherub.
   
   Homer:  Bart!  Lisa!  [swans stampede Homer]  Willya... D'oh...  Where are are
           you kids!  [Bart beans Homer with a rock]  Ow!
   Bart:   Oops.  [Homer grabs Bart]  Whoa, careful Dad.  Blow a gasket, and
           you lose you job.
   -- ``''
   
   
   NOW HEAR THIS, THE FATHER-SON SACK RACE WILL BEGIN IN FIVE MINUTES
   ON THE NORTH LAWN.  PARTICIPATION IS MANDATORY, REPEAT MANDATORY.
   THAT IS ALL.
   -- Picnic announcement, ``''
   
   Homer:  You remember the rules from last year?
   Bart:   Yeah, shut my mouth and let your boss win.
   -- ``''
   
 Homer drags Bart along to the event.  One of the swans has its revenge on
 Bart's behind.  The employees' wives are gathered around a bowl of punch.
   
   Mother:  I don't know who to love more...  My son Joshua who's
            captain of the football team, or my daughter Amber who got the lead
            in the school play.  Usually, I use their grades as a tie-breaker,
            but they both got straight A's this term, so what's a mother to do?
   Marge:   [helping herself to ample amounts of the punch]  Umm-hmm.  Well I
            sense greatness in my family.
   Mother:  &lt;Your&gt; family?
   Marge:   Well, it's a greatness that others can't see... but it's there, and
            if it's not &lt;true&gt; greatness we have, we're at &lt;least&gt; average.
   -- ``''
   
   I don't want to alarm anyone, [woozily]  but I think there's a
   little al-key-hol in this punch.  [scoops another cupful]
   -- Marge enjoys some liquid refreshment at the company picnic,
      ``''
   
 The Father-Son sack race is ready to be run.
   
   Smithers: Mr. Burns, are you ready?
   Burns:    Yes.
   Smithers: Are you set?
   Burns:    Yes.
   Smithers: [whispers]  Go, Mr. Burns!
   Burns:    [feebly hops away]
   Smithers: [after Burns gets a healthy lead, fires the starter's pistol]
             (*bang*)
   -- The Father-Son sack race at the company picnic,
      ``''
   
 Everyone cautiously stays a few leaps behind the man who can fire them.
 Bart grouses, ``Man, this is pathetic!  I'm going for it!''  Bart takes
 the lead, and Homer does a flying tackle to stop Bart just short of
 the finishing line.  Burns feebly hops to victory.  ``Close one this year.''

 Marge is at this point completely sloshed and leads the other mothers
 in a song.
   
   Marge:  Here we sit, enjoying the shade.
   Wives:  Hey, Marge, and pour the wine!
   Marge:  Drink the drink that I have made.
   Wives:  Hey, Marge, and pour the wine!
   Marge:  He's here with me, my one and only.
   Homer:  [runs past chasing the kids, sees Marge]  Huh?
   Marge:  Drink, my friends and don't be lonely.
   Homer:  [slaps his forehead] Oh!
   Wives:  Hey Marge, and pour the wine!
   -- ``''
   
 Homer goes to retrieve his wife.
   
   Homer:  Snap out of it Marge!  You've gotta come with me, the boss is going
           to make a toast.
   Marge:  Whoa, oh, I'm not much of a drinker.  [collapses]
   Homer:  You picked a perfect time to start, you... [Marge gazes at him]
   -- ``''
   
 Late afternoon, and everyone is gathered around the rotunda.  A marching band
 plays ``For He's a Jolly Good Fellow''.
   
   Burns:    Musicians, cease that infernal tootling! [they do]
   Smithers: [hands Burns a card]
   Burns:    Thank you all.
   Smithers: [hands another card]
   Burns:    Ah... For coming.
   -- ``''
   
 The crowd applauds.  Marge keeps clapping, then apologizes to everyone
 (individually).
   
   Now it's time to say goodbye.
   Please get off my property until next year.
   I suggest you don't dawdle, the hounds will be released in ten minutes.
   -- Burns closes the company picnic, ``''
   
 As the families leave, a son thanks his father for the good time he's had.
 Mr. Burns likes to see this kind of family unity and promotes the father.
   
   Homer:  Quick Bart, give me a kiss.
   Bart:   Kiss you?  But Dad, I'm your kid!
   -- ``''
   
 Homer pays Bart five dollars.  Bart takes the money and uncomfortably
 kisses his father.
   
   Burns:    Ugh, I've never seen such an obvious attempt to curry my favor.
   Smithers: Fabulous observation sir, just fabulous.
   -- ``''
   
 Everyone walks back to their cars (except for Marge, who is flying Cloud-9)
 Homer congratulates the other father for his success with ``that corn-ball
 routine.''  Homer watches the other man's son politely opens the door for
 his sister, while Bart and Lisa fight to be the first in the car.
 As the `good' wife offers to drive her tired husband home, Marge thinks
 she's going to be sick.

 The other family (complete with halos and angelic wings) drive off,
 singing, ``There was a farmer who had a dog, and Bingo was his name-o...''
 He looks back at the demons that possess his family, with their sharp teeth
 and nails, elfin ears and fiery hair.  The surrounding country-side takes on
 a hellish glow.
   
   Marge:  Homey!  Get in the car!
   Lisa:   This is where you belong!
   Bart:   Yeah Homer, room for one more!
   Marge+Lisa+Bart: [chanting]  One of us!  One of us!  One of us!  One of us!
   -- ``''
   
 They cackle sinisterly as Homer steps into the car and drives off into a
 landscape covered in lava and burning sulphur.  The blessed family ride home
 on their ``Roadway to Heaven''.  Homer sighs as the camera pulls back to
 show the interior of the car (everyone is back to normal), with Marge looking
 very sour.

 [End of Act One.  Time: 7:06]

 Dinnertime at the Simpsons.  Marge and the kids shovel food into their
 mouths while staring at the TV.  ``Unable to fend for themselves, the baby
 bald eaglets are dependent on their mother regurgitating the food.''
 This doesn't affect Bart and Lisa's appetites at all.  Homer enters,
 turns off the TV set, and insists, ``We're not going to shovel food into
 our mouths while we stare at the TV.  We're going to eat at the dining
 room table like a normal family.''

 The family are seated in the dining room.  Lisa asks, ``Happy, Dad?''
 Homer answers, ``Yes.''  Lisa concludes, ``Good, commence shoveling.''

 Homer stops everyone in mid-shovel and insists they say Grace.
   
   Rub-a-dub-dub, thanks for the grub.
   -- Bart says Grace, ``''
   
 Homer stops him. ``Ignore the boy, Lord.''
   
   Homer:  Dear Lord, thank You for this microwave bounty, even though we
           don't deserve it.  I mean... our kids are uncontrollable hellions!
           Pardon my French... but they act like savages! [kids bewildered]
           Did You see them at the picnic?  Oh, of course You did... You're
           everywhere, You're omnivorous.
           Oh Lord!  Why did You spite me with this family?
   Marge and the kids:  Amen!
   -- ``''
   
 With a shout of ``Let's eat!'' Bart and the family recommence shoveling.
   
   Homer:  Sometimes I think we're the worst family in town.
   Marge:  Maybe we should move to a larger community.
   -- ``''
   
   D'oh!
   -- Homer, ``''
   
   Don't have a cow, Dad.
   -- Bart, ``''
   
   The sad truth is, all families are like us.
   -- Lisa, ``''
   
 Homer begs to differ.  ``Well there's only one way to find out.''  He
 takes the family on a little excursion.

 The family crawl up to a neighbor's window and inside see a standard
 1950's television family having a banquet.
   
   Homer:  Look at that, kids!  No fighting, no yelling.
   Bart:   No belching.
   Lisa:   Their dad has a shirt on!
   Marge:  Look!  Napkins!
   Bart:   These people are obviously freaks.
   -- Homer takes the family to see what `normal' families are like,
      ``''
   
 Homer takes them to ``see what's behind door number two.''  The family
 see a family having a conversation.  ``They actually enjoy talking to
 each other,'' observes Marge.  The conversation?  The child says,
 ``I believe I heard some rustling in the bushes.''  The father answers,
 ``I did too.  Better get the gun.''  The father appears at the front
 door with a shotgun.

 The Simpsons make their escape, then approach another window.
   
   Bart:   Whoa!  Look at this place, what a dump!
   Homer:  It's worst than you think, heh heh heh.  I just trampled this poor
           sap's flower bed.
   Marge:  Ho-mer, this is &lt;our&gt; house.
   -- Homer takes the family to see what `normal' families are like,
      ``''
   
 Homer lingers outside.
   
   I want to be alone with my thought.
   -- Homer, ``''
   
 At Moe's tavern, Homer has no interest in the boxing match.
 The two cops walk in.
   
   Moe:    Eddie!  Would you like some pretzels?
   Eddie:  No thanks, we're on duty.  A couple of beers would be nice though.
   -- The two cops pay a visit to Moe's Tavern, ``''
   
 They're investigating a family of peeping toms who have been terrorizing
 the neighborhood.  The police dog finds Homer and goes nuts, and the cops
 must remove the dog forcibly from the premises.
   
   You know Moe, my mom once said something that really stuck with me.
   She said, ``Homer, you're a big disappointment'', and God bless her
   soul, she was really onto something.
   -- Homer, ``''
   
   Barney: Don't blame yourself Homer.  You've got yourself a bad hand.  You've
           got crummy little kids that nobody can control.
   Homer:  You can't talk way about my kids!  Or at least two of them.
   -- ``''
   
 Barney asks, ``You got two that I haven't met?''\ and earns a fistful
 from Homer.  As the boxing match continues, Homer and Barney struggle
 on their own.  Barney floors Homer.  A commercial comes on, and Homer
 watches from floor-level.
   
   TV:      All-star Boxing was brought to you by ``Doctor Marvin Monroe's
            Family Therapy Center''.  [Dr. Marvin Monroe waves.]
   Wife:    Honey, aren't you going to work today?
   Husband: No-o-o... I don't think so.
   Wife:    Honey, you have a problem, and it won't get better until you admit it.
   Husband: I admit this...  You better shut your big yap!
   Wife:    Oh you shut up.
   Husband: No, you shut up!
   Wife:    No &lt;you&gt; shut up!

 [End of Act 2.  Time: 11:45]

 Marge is with the kids watching an Itchy and Scratchy cartoon.  Homer enters.
   
   Homer:  All right, time for a family meeting.  [shuts off the TV]
   Lisa:   Why can't we have a meeting when &lt;you're&gt; watching TV?
   -- ``''
   
   Homer:  Now look... You know and I know this family needs help, professional
           help.  So I've made us an appointment with Dr. Marvin Monroe.
   Bart:   The fat guy on TV?
   Lisa:   You're sending us to a doctor who advertises on pro-wrestling?
   Homer:  Boxing, Lisa, boxing.  There's a world of difference.
   -- ``''
   
 Marge is worried if this is this the right thing to do.
   
   Honey, I've given this matter a lot of study, and of all the commercials
   I saw, his was the best.
   -- Homer suggests the family see Dr. Marvin Monroe,
      ``''
   
 And it costs only $250.  Marge tells him they don't have that kind of money.
 Homer commands her to bring out the kids' college fund.
   
   Oh come on Marge... Why skimp now on the off-chance that they'll
   actually get in someplace.
   -- Homer asks Marge to fetch the children's college fund,
      ``''
   
 Marge counts the contents of a smashed piggy-bank on the kitchen table.
 Eighty-eight dollars and fifty cents.  Homer's not licked yet.
   
   Homer:  To save this family we're gonna have to make the &lt;supreme&gt; sacrifice.
   Lisa:   No Dad!  Please don't pawn the TV!
   Bart:   Aw come on, Dad, anything but that!
   -- ``''
   
   Marge:  Homer, couldn't we pawn my engagement ring instead?
   Homer:  I appreciate that, honey,
           but we need one hundred an fifty dollars here!
   -- ``''
   
 They enter the pawn shop.  The clerk welcomes the family (by name).
   
   Homer:  [presenting TV]  Would you pay $150 for this &lt;lovely&gt; Motorola?
   Clerk:  Is it cable-ready?
   Homer:  As ready as she'll ever be.
   -- Pawn shop, ``''
   
 They have a deal.  At Dr. Monroe's Family Therapy Center, the family signs
 for their appointment with the receptionist.  ``My Love Is Blue'' plays in
 the background.
   
   Marge:  [despairingly] Homer, you raided the college fund, the TV... Homer,
           you're driving a stake through the hearts of those who love you.
   Homer:  Hey!  No pain, no gain!
   -- ``''
   
   Receptionist:  Will you be paying by cash or check?
   Homer:  Cash of course!  I've got two hundred and fifty dollars right here
           with me.  I'm holding it right now.  Here it is, look... check it
           out.  [Homer realizes he could be making a big mistake.]  Two hundred
           and fifty big ones.
   Bart:   You really want to impress her, show her the big empty space where
           our TV used to be.
   -- ``''
   
 A family who resemble the Simpsons have concluded their therapy session, and
 go to express their new found ability to express love for each other with a
 round of frosty chocolate milkshakes.  Homer makes his decision, and hands
 the money over to the receptionist.  ``There go my young girl dreams of
 Vassar,'' muses Lisa.

 Dr. Marvin Monroe welcomes the Simpsons into his office.
   
   Monroe: Hello, I'm Doctor Marvin Monroe, no doubt you recognize me from TV.
   Lisa:   We would if we had one.
   -- ``''
   
 Homer shouts at Lisa, but Marvin Monroe tells Homer he mustn't stifle the
 youngster, that his family must be free to express itself.  Dr. Monroe
 hands them pads and jumbo markers to draw their fears, their anxieties,
 the roots of their unhappiness.  They take a deep cleansing breath, and
 begin.

 Bart shows a drawing of Homer.  Lisa, the same.  Marge likewise.  [Monroe:
 ``No surprises there.'']  Homer continues drawing, not paying attention to
 Dr. Monroe.  He draws a plane dropping a load of bombs.  Doctor Marvin
 Monroe concludes that the family views Homer as ``an ogre, if you will.''
 Bart's chimes his agreement, and Homer reaches for a lamp.  Doctor
 Monroe quickly takes possession of the lamp.
   
   Whoa!  Okay, so you want to kill each other.  That's good, that's
   healthy.  There's nothing necessarily wrong with hostile conflict.
   -- Doctor Marvin Monroe's Family Therapy, ``''
   
 He asks merely that they use his patented aggression therapy mallets,
 unlocking them from a gun-rack.  Said mallets consists of a steel rod
 padded with foam rubber.  After another deep cleansing breath, the
 Simpsons take it out on each other.
   
   Homer:  Wait a minute, these mallet things are padded with foam rubber.
           What's the point?
   Bart:   They work much better without the padding, Doc.
   -- At Doctor Marvin Monroe's Family Therapy, ``''
   
 Over Marvin Monroe's protestations, Bart demonstrates his point by
 thwacking the doctor's shin.  Dr. Monroe angrily takes the steel rod
 from Bart and concludes that portion of the treatment.  Asks Marge,
 ``Are we cured yet?''  Monroe answers, ``No!  Don't be ridiculous.''
 He requires somewhat more unorthodox methods.  ``I'll have plenty of
 time to explain while I warm up the...  Electric generator.''

 In another room, the family sit with metal straps attached to their head and
 arms, and a console with four button in front of each of them.
   
   Monroe: Everyone comfy?  Hmmph, good.  Now don't touch any of those buttons
           in front of you for a very important reason.  I.e., You are wired in
           to the rest of your family.  You have the ability to shock them, and
           they have the ability to shock---(*buzzzzzz*)
   Homer:  Waaaaaaugh!
   Bart:   Just testing.
   -- At Doctor Marvin Monroe's Family Therapy, ``''
   
 Homer is about to press a button, but Monroe holds his arm back.
   
   Monroe: This is what's known as aversion therapy.  When someone hurts you
           emotionally, you will hurt them physically, and gradually you will
           learn not to hurt each other at all!  And won't that be wonderful

 Bart zaps Homer.  Homer zaps Bart.  Someone zaps Marge.  Lisa zaps Homer and
 Bart.  Bart zaps back.  Maggie meanwhile is happily pressing buttons at
 random (Marge, Homer, Lisa), until someone zaps her.  Everyone zaps everyone
 else.  The situation is clearly out of control.  Marge zaps Homer.  Lisa is
 zapped.  Maggie zaps Marge.  Homer zaps Bart twice.  Maggie zaps Marge.
 Marge zaps Maggie and Lisa.

 The receptionist and the other families waiting in the foyer notice the drain
 to the electrical power in the building.  The other families flee.  All the
 lights across Springfield flicker...
   
   Smithers: Boy, someone's really gobbling up the juice, sir.
   Burns:    Excellent!  Excellent!  [walking over to a power meter]  Perhaps
             this energy conservation fad is as dead as the dodo.
   -- ``''
   
 Monroe is still trying to get the Simpsons to stop.  Homer receives a massive
 jolt.  Bart goes to shock Lisa, but is beaten to the draw.  Lisa is zapped,
 and zaps Marge in return.  Marge zaps Homer and Bart zaps Lisa at the same
 time.  Maggie keeps pressing away at the buttons.

 The receptionist runs in to the laboratory.  ``Doctor Monroe!  Your other
 patients have fled the building!''  Over near-continuous buzzing, Dr. Monroe
 pleads, Stop!  Your damaging the equipment!''  In desperation, he pulls
 the power cord.

 The electrical generator winds down.  Smoke wafts from the family's heads.
 ``Hey, nice hair Mom,'' says Bart.  ``Gee, I thought we were making real
 progress,'' notes Marge.  Homer reminds the doctor that his commercial
 promised, ``Family bliss, or double our money back.''  ``But that was
 just a...  All right.''  He reluctantly tells the receptionist to get the
 money.

 Outside, Monroe counts $500 into Homer's hand, and angrily tells them to
 leave and not tell anyone that they were there.

 The family are astounded at their first pleasant surprise.  ``It's not the
 money, as much as the feeling that we earned it,'' observes Lisa.
 Marge suggests they repurchase their pawned television set, but Homer
 has bigger plans.  ``We're gonna get a new TV.  Twenty-one inch screen,
 realistic flesh tones, and a little cart so we can wheel it into the
 dining room on holidays.''  The kids cheer.  Marge kisses him.

 The Simpsons walk up the street together as a family.

 ``Bingo'' plays over the executive producer credits.

 Didja notice...

    ... the mouse hole in the dining room?
    ... the cakes (and a gelatin dessert) shaped as cooling towers at the
        picnic?
    ... when Maggie peeks out from behind the gelatinous dessert,
        it looks like she's been devoured by a pink blob!
    ... as Homer turns off the TV for the `family meeting', Scratchy swings a

        attacked.)
    ... the 'ideal' family at the therapy center?
    ... Maggie smiling behind her pacifier while she's happily pressing all the
        buttons?
    ... Maggie's ears wiggling when Homer announces buying the new TV?
    ... Homer hums the "Air Force Song" as he draws the picture of the
        airplane? {Rick Gray}
    ... although Bart chooses ``respect,'' he later kisses Homer?

 Reviews


Chris Baird {cjb}:  The funniest idea of &lt;all&gt; time has got to be Marge
blasted at the company picnic.  One of the episodes I would recommend if
you were trying to convince people who may have been turned away from the
show by all the crappy merchandising.

Yours Truly {rjc}:  I haven't seen this episode in years, but I &lt;still&gt;
laugh just reading Chris's summary.

 Boring distribution restrictions

Well, I guess you're looking for some kind of distribution notice down here.
I &lt;still&gt; haven't thought of one yet, but as long as you only make `fair use'
of this I really don't mind you redistributing this to other Simpson
fanatics.  Ciao, Chris J Baird, Esq.  Updated 1999 Andrew A. Gill.

 EPISODE TITLE: Bart the General


EPISODE SUMMARY: 

   

 Interior of the oven, cupcakes baking.  Homer opens the door, and Marge
 explains that Lisa's baking them for her teacher.  Door closes.  Bart
 opens the door and reaches in, but Marge yanks him away.  Lisa
 ices the most recent batch of chocolate cupcakes...
   
   Bart:  You know, there are names for people like you.
   Lisa:  No there aren't.
   Bart:  Teacher's pet!  Apple polisher!  Butt-kisser!
   Homer: Bart, you're saying butt-kisser like it's a bad thing!
   -- ``''
   
 Homer tells Bart it never hurts to grease the wheel, but Lisa denies that
 she's doing it for the grades.  She gets good grades because she pays
 attention and studies hard.  Homer grabs a cupcake, and the kids dash off
 when the school bus horn honks.  Lisa nips back in time to grab the
 cupcake before Homer can eat it.  (``D'oh!'')

 Bart complains to Otto that Lisa baked a batch of cupcakes for her teacher
 and isn't letting him have even a single crumb.  Lisa hands over a cupcake.
 ``Here, Otto.  I made an extra one for you.''

 Bart takes the seat next to Lisa, and when the bus sets into motion, the
 box jostles, and Bart helps catch it.  Lisa grabs the box back.
   
   Bart: You sniveling toad!  You little egg-sucker!
   Lisa: [holding secure her box of cupcakes] Tell me more!
   Bart; Back-scratcher!  Boot-licker!  Honor student!
   Lisa: [smirking]  You'll never get one now, name-caller.
   Bart: All right, all right.  Look, I'm sorry.  I, I got upset.
         In the heat of the moment, I said some things I didn't mean.
   Lisa: [milking it] You weren't thinking, were you.
   Bart: No.
   Lisa: I'm &lt;not&gt; a sniveling toad, am I?
   Bart: Not really.
   Lisa: I'm &lt;not&gt; a little egg-sucker, am I?
   Bart: Of course not.
   Lisa: Then what am I?
   Bart: A beautiful human being.
   Lisa: [coyly]  What do you like best about me?
   Bart: [staring at the cupcakes] Well, I'd have to say...
         Your generous nature, your spirit of giving.
   Lisa: Well... [thinks]  Open your mouth and close your eyes, and you will
         get a big surprise.
   Bart: [does so]
   Lisa: [gets up.  The bus stops, and a cupcake falls out of the box.
         Lisa picks it up and shoves it into Bart's mouth, then leaves]
   Bart: [munching]  Thanks, Lis.  You're the best!
   -- ``''
   
 Once off the bus, a bully grabs the cupcakes and goes through the box,
 taking one bite out of each before discarding it.  Bart threatens the
 boy, but Lisa warns Bart that the kid is a friend of Nelson Muntz.
 The boy pretends to hand over the box, but drops it and stomps on it.
 This proves too much for Bart, who leaps to attack the kid.  A scuffle
 ensues (with the other kids cheering), and a hand reaches in and grabs
 Bart.  It's Nelson, who holds Bart harmlessly at arm's length, then
 tosses him aside.  Nelson is bleeding.  He explains that he always
 gets other people's blood on his face.  But this time, it really &lt;is&gt;
 his blood.
   
   It was an accident, man.  A terrible, ghastly mistake.
   -- Bart tries to talk his way out of another jam, ``''
   
 A cold wind blows.  Skinner stops by.  ``Play friendly, children.''
 The bell rings.
   
   Nelson: [threateningly] I'll get you after school, man.
   Bart:   But...
   Princ. Skinner: Oh no no no, he'll get you after school, son.
           Now hurry up, it's time for class.
   Bart:   But...
   Princ. Skinner: [shooing]  Scoot, young Simpson!  There's learning to be done!
   -- ``''
   
 During class, Bart daydreams...  Nelson is now a giant, who chases Bart
 down the hallway.  Bart throws knives at him, which he merely pushes
 away after they embed in his chest.  Bullets from a machine gun merely
 bounce off him.  Bart is trapped, and giant-Nelson grabs Bart and says,
 ``Lunchtime!''  Bart falls down Nelson's throat...

 ``Lunchtime, Bart,'' says Milhouse.  Milhouse tells Bart he has to
 tell Skinner, but Bart refuses to violate the code of the schoolyard.

 They reach the lunchroom, where Lisa introduces ``Bart the bully-killer!''
   
   Look, everybody.  I would just as soon not make a big deal out of this.
   I'm not saying that I'm not a hero.
   I'm just saying that... I fear for my safety.
   -- Bart, ``''
   
 Nelson and his two cronies push through the crowd.  The other kids scoot.
 Nelson tells Bart to be at the flagpole at 3:15.  And not to be late.
 He has four other meetings that afternoon.

 Bart daydreams in class again...   It's his funeral.  Open casket.  (Bart
 has his lunchbox tucked under his arm.)
   
   Otto: [at Bart's wake]  Good-bye, little dude.
         [to Principal Skinner]  He looks so lifelike, man!
   Principal Skinner: Yes, the nurse did a wonderful job reconstructing his
         little face after the fight.  Good-bye, son.  I guess you were right.
         All that homework &lt;was&gt; a waste of your time.
   -- Wake me when it's over, ``''
   
   Thanks, Bart!  We got the day off from school for this!
   -- Milhouse attends Bart's wake, ``''
   
 Homer gleefully says he got the day off from work for this.  Marge jabs
 him in the ribs, and Homer acts in a manner more befitting the situation.
 Marge and Maggie bid Bart farewell.  Lisa holds a cupcake.  ``I can't
 help but think if I had just given it to you in the first place,
 this whole horrible tragedy could have been avoided.''  She leaves it
 on his forehead.  Nelson comes up and takes the cupcake.  ``Hey, look!
 They've got food at this thing!''  He then gives Bart a parting punch.

 The 3:15 bell rings.  Bart tries to sneak out (hiding behind ridiculous
 things), but Nelson blocks his way.
   
   Nelson:  Put 'em up!  [circles his fists]
   Bart:    [raises his hands in surrender]
   -- ``''
   
 Nelson pummels a helpless Bart.  Bart eventually collapses.  ``Boy, you
 sure taught &lt;me&gt; a lesson.''  Bart is dragged off and dumped into a trash
 can.  ``I'm going to get you again tomorrow, Simpson.''  Bart takes a
 free ride in the garbage can down the street.  Bart mutters, ``Man, that
 guy's tough to love...''

 [End of Act One.  Time: 7:24ish]

 Bart climbs out of the garbage can onto the Simpsons front lawn.  He falls
 and crawls inside.  Marge seems concerned, but Homer just laughs it off.
 Bart goes into the bathroom, takes a quick look in the mirror (``I'm gonna
 miss ya, big guy'') and sits in the tub, moaning in pain.  Homer pops in,
 at Marge's insistence.  Bart tearfully asks Homer's help.  The first step
 is to dry Bart's tears, which Homer does with a high-power hair blower.
   
   Bart:  Well, I had a run-in with a... bully.
   Marge: [bursts in] A bully!?
   Homer: [annoyed] Come on, Marge!  I don't bug you when you're helping Lisa!
   Marge: Well, Bart, I hope you're going straight to the principal about this.
   Bart:  I... guess I could do that.
   Homer: What!?  And violate the code of the schoolyard!?
          I'd rather Bart die!
   Marge: What on earth are you talking about, Homer!?
   Homer: The code of the schoolyard, Marge!  The rules that teach a boy to be
          a man.  Let's see.  [enumerates them on his fingers] Don't tattle.
          Always make fun of those different from you.  Never say anything,
          unless you're sure everyone feels exactly the same way you do.
          What else...
   -- Rule number four:  Girls have cooties, ``''
   
 Marge will hear nothing of this.
   
   Marge: This bully friend of yours.  Is he a little on the chunky side?
   Bart:  Yeah, he's pretty chunkified, all right.
   Marge: Mmm.  And I'll bet he doesn't do well in his studies, either.
   Bart:  No, he's pretty dumb.  He's in all the same special classes I am.
   -- ``''
   
 Marge suggests he try talking it out, but Homer drags Bart away. ``Thank
 you very much, Mrs. Maharishi Gandhi.''

 Down in the rumpus room, Homer draws a face on a punching bag and invites
 Bart to do his worst.  Bart feebly punches it.  ``No, no, not like that.
 Like this!''  Homer leaps onto the bag, clawing and chewing.  He spits
 out a mouthful of cloth.
   
   Homer: You didn't expect that, did you.  And neither will he.
   Bart:  You mean that I should fight dirty, Dad?
   Homer: Unfortunately, son, we Simpsons sometimes have to bend the rules
          a little in order to hold our own.
   Bart:  Amen!
   Homer: So the next time this bully thinks you're going to throw a punch,
          you throw a glob of mud in his eye!
          And then you sock him [pounds fist into hand] when he staggers
          around blinded!
   Bart:  [getting into it]  Yeah!
   Homer: And there's nothing wrong with hitting someone when his back is turned.
   Bart:  Gotcha.
   Homer: [quietly] And if you get the chance, get him right in the family jewels.
          That little doozy's been a Simpson trademark for generations.
          [punches the punching bag down low]
   Bart:  [cringes]  Thanks, Pop.
   -- The rules of the schoolyard, Simpson style, ``''
   
 Bart skids to a halt on the schoolyard when Nelson appears.  Nelson squares
 off for a fistfight, so Bart throws mud in his eye.  Nelson rubs it off
 and marches onward.  Homer appears in a thought balloon.  ``The family
 jewels, son.''  Bart lunges for Nelson, who holds him safely away at
 arm's length.  Dream-Homer shrugs.  Bart's-eye view of Nelson's fist
 approaching.  Dream-Homer cringes as Bart is beaten (offscreen) to a pulp.
 His lucky red hat obvious didn't help.  ``Oh, no.  Not the can, please.''

 Lisa sits on the curb licking a green ice cream cone.  (Spearmint?
 Pistachio?)  Bart rolls in.  He coughs up his lucky red hat.
   
   Lisa: Why don't you go see Grampa?
   Bart: What can &lt;he&gt; do?
   Lisa: He'll give you good advice.  He's the toughest Simpson alive.
   Bart: He is?
   Lisa: Yeah, remember the fight he put up when we put him in the home?
   -- ``''
   
 At the Springfield Retirement Home, Bart asks to see Grampa.  Heads poke
 out of doors all down the hall.  Grampa Simpson.  Heads return, disappointed.
 Grampa types an angry letter.
   
   Dear Advertisers,
       I am disgusted with the way old people are depicted on television.
   We are not all vibrant, fun-loving sex maniacs.  Many of us are bitter,
   resentful individuals who remember the good old days when entertainment
   was bland and inoffensive.  The following is a list of words I never
   want to hear on television again.  Number one:  Bra.  Number two:  Horny.
   Number three:  Family Jewels.
   -- Grampa Simpson, ``''
   
 Grampa tells Bart, ``If you don't stand up for yourself, bullies are going
 to be picking on you for the rest of your life.''  Jasper comes in and
 demands Grampa's newspaper so he can do the crossword.  A fierce struggle
 ensues, and Jasper wins.  Grampa realizes he can't be much help, but
 he knows someone who can.

 They go to Herman's Military Antiques.
   
   Herman: [whispers] What's the password?
   Grampa: Let me in, you idiot!
   Herman: Right you are.  [opens the door]
   -- ``''
   
 Grampa introduces Bart.
   
   Bart:   Uh, Mr. Herman?
   Herman: Yes?
   Bart:   Did, did you lose your arm in the war?
   Herman: My arm?  Well, let me put it this way:  Next time your teacher tells
           you to keep your arm inside the bus window, you do it!
   Bart:   [nervously]  Yes, sir.  I will.
   -- ``''
   
 Grampa explains that Bart's having trouble with a local bully named Nelson.
   
   Herman: How many men do you have?
   Bart:   None.
   Herman: You'll need more.
   -- ``''
   
 Herman produces a map.
   
   The key to Springfield has always been Elm Street.
   The Greeks knew it.  The Carthaginians knew it.  Now &lt;you&gt; know it.
   -- Herman, ``''
   
   First, you'll need a declaration of war.  That way, everything you do will be
   nice and legal.
   -- Herman, giving Bart advice on dealing with a local bully,
      ``''
   
 Herman uses a slightly modified one from the Franco-Prussian War.
   
   Bart:   Pssst.  Grampa, I think this guy's a little nuts.
   Grampa: Oh yeah?  Well, General George S. Patton was a little nuts.
           And this guy's completely out of his mind!  We can't fail!!
   -- ``''
   
 [End of Act Two.  Time: 14:29ish]

 At Springfield Elementary, a note is passed around.  It reads, ``If you
 hate and fear Nelson, meet at Bart's treehouse.  1500 hrs.  (3pm).''

 Bart's treehouse is packed, but Bart is late.  He staggers in, bruised,
 coughs up his lucky red hat, and hangs it up.
   
   Bart:     Okay, we all know why we're here, right?
   Milhouse: No, why?
   Bart:     To fight Nelson, the bully.  That guy has been tormenting all of
             us for years, and I for one am sick of it!
             I can't promise you victory.  I can't promise you good times.
             But the one thing I do know...
             [all the kids file out]
             Whoa!  Whoa!
             I promise you victory!  I promise you good times!
             [kids cheer]
   -- Give 'em what they want, ``''
   
 Bart's infantry marches in time, each soldier equipped with a helmet.
   
   Bart: I got a B in arithmetic.
   Army: I got a B in arithmetic.
   Bart: Would have got an A but I was sick.
   Army: Would have got an A but I was sick.

 Swing-ring practice.  Milhouse misses a ring and falls to the ground.
 (``Aaagghh!'')  Then is knocked over by another trainee.  (``Aggh!'')

 Climbing the monkey bars.  A helmet falls.  Luckily, everyone below
 was wearing their helmets.

 Collision avoidance drills.  One of the kids falls into a dustbin.
 (``Oomph!'')
   
   Bart: We are rubber, you are glue.
   Army: We are rubber, you are glue.
   Bart: It bounces off of us and sticks to you.
   Army: It bounces off of us and sticks to you.
   Bart: Sound off.
   Army: One!  Two!
   Bart: Sound off!
   Army: Three!! Four!!

 Crossing the stream.  The rock in the middle of the water turns out to
 be a kid wearing a helmet.

 The kids march through mud as General Bart (wearing shades and chewing
 on a piece of grass) watches.

 Silhouetted against the setting sun, the kids climb the monkey bars.
 One kid slips.

 Munitions training.  Bart points at an easel, on which is mounted a
 schematic of a water balloon.  The balloon in Bart's hand bursts.

 Battle simulator.  Kids run past an angry dog.
   
   Bart: What's the matter with you, soldier!
   Boy:  It's my nerves, sir.  I just can't stand the barking any more.
   Bart: Your nerves!  [slaps the kid]  I won't have cowards in my army.
   Grampa: [whaps Bart]  Sorry, Bart.
         You can push them out of a plane, you can march them off a cliff,
         you can send them off to die on some God-forsaken rock, but for
         some reason you can't slap them.
   -- ``''
   
   Bart: In English class I did the best.
   Army: In English class I did the best.
   Bart: Because I cheated on the test.
   Army: Because I cheated on the test.
   Bart: Sound off.
   Army: One!  Two!
   Bart: I can't hear you!
   Army: Three!!  Four!!

 Simulated hand-to-hand.  The kids attack a stuffed bag.  Lewis uses a
 plunger.  Another boy uses a dust mop.  Milhouse attacks with a fly
 swatter.

 Bart calls, ``Okay, next group!  Martinez!  Steinberg!  O'Hara!  Chang!
 Olajuwan!  Herman!''  Herman attacks the bag with a bayonet.
   
   Bart: We are happy, we are merry.
   Army: We are happy, we are merry.
   Bart: We got a rhyming dictionary.
   Army: We got a rhyming dictionary.

 In the treehouse, a scale model of Springfield is laid out on the table,
 with saltshakers used to indicate troop placement and strengths.  During
 the strategic planning, the shakers are pushed around with those pusher
 things Army people use.  Intelligence reports that Nelson shakes down
 kids at the video arcade for quarters, then heads to the Kwik-E-Mart for
 a cherry Squishee.
   
   Herman: When he leaves the Kwik-E-Mart, we start the saturation bombing.
           You got the water balloons?
   Bart:   [salutes]  Two hundred rounds, sir.  [holds a balloon]
           Is it okay if they say `Happy Birthday' on the side?
   Herman: Urgh.  I'd rather they say `Death from Above', but I guess we're stuck.
   -- Saturation bombing with a smile, ``''
   
 Herman sketches the strategy.
   
   It's a classic Pincer's Movement.  It can't fail against a ten-year-old!
   -- Herman lends Bart military advice, ``''
   
 Lewis reports Nelson's position, and Bart calls everyone to battle stations.
 Yells Herman, ``I feel so alive!''
   
   I thought I was too old.  I thought my time had passed.  I thought I'd never
   hear the screams of pain, or see the look of terror in a man's eyes.  Thank
   heaven for children!
   -- Grampa Simpson, ``''
   
 Nelson and his two goons return from their Squishee-fest, and Bart blocks
 their path.  ``Nelson, I'm afraid I'm going to have to teach you a lesson.''
 ``Oh yeah?  You and what army?''  ``This one.''  Bart's troops emerge from
 their hiding places, water balloons poised.  (One accidentally goes off
 early.)  Bart yells, ``Commence saturation bombing!''  Nelson and his
 goons are pummelled with water balloons.  They make a run for it, but
 their escape route is blocked off.  Nelson runs past the Simpsons house,
 with the army in hot pursuit.
   
   Homer: All right, you kids!  Keep it down!  Am I making myself cl--[oomph]
          [Homer is hit by a water balloon]
   Grampa: [giggles]  Heh heh, got him!
   Homer: You!  Up in the tree!  The tall grey-haired kid!  You come down
          here right now!
   Grampa: [pegs Homer in the face with another balloon]

 Nelson and his goons are trapped.
   
   Goon #1: Don't hurt us!
   Goon #2: We surrender!
   Goon #1: We were only following orders!
   -- A likely story, ``''
   
 The army go after Nelson and saturate him at point-blank range.

 Bart and Milhouse parade Nelson, tied up in the wagon.  Lisa stands
 in the street surveying the damage, when a soldier boy rushes up
 and kisses her, the moment captured forever in a photo.  (Some soldiers
 have all the luck.)  Lisa slaps him.  ``Ewwww, knock it off!''

 Bart says, ``You learned your lesson, so now I'll untie you.''
 Nelson threatens, ``The second you untie me, I'm gonna beat you to
 death, man.''  So Bart decides never to untie him.  Nelson scoffs,
 ``You're going to have to, sometime.''  Bart realizes Nelson is right.
 Herman steps forward, ``I was ready for this little eventuality.''

 Nelson (still tied up) watches TV on the Simpsons couch, while Herman
 finishes the armistice.
   
   Article Four:  Nelson is never again to raise his fists in anger.
   Article Five:  Nelson recognizes Bart's right to exist.
   Article Six:   Although Nelson shall have no official power,
                  he shall remain a figurehead of menace in the neighborhood.
   -- Terms of surrender, ``''
   
 The parties sign the agreement.  Marge asks, ``Are you boys through
 playing war?''  Bart unties Nelson, and they say, ``Yeah.''
 ``Then here are some cupcakes!''  Cupcakes are enjoyed by all.
 Maggie belches.

 Fade to a library.  Bart sits on the reading table.
   
   Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls.
   Contrary to what you've just seen, war is neither glamorous nor fun.
   There are no winners, only losers.  There are no good wars, with the
   following exceptions:  The American Revolution, World War II,
   and the Star Wars Trilogy.  If you'd like to learn more about war,
   there's lots of books in your local library, many of them with cool,
   gory pictures.  Well, good night, everybody.  Peace, man.

 EPISODE TITLE: Moaning Lisa


EPISODE SUMMARY: 

   

 With tears in her eyes, Lisa stares forlornly into the bathroom mirror,
 as Homer waits impatiently to use the facilities.  Lisa leaves the
 bathroom, looking up at Homer as she go past.  Bart slips in.  ``Sorry Dad,
 women and children first!''

 Breakfast time at the Simpsons.  Homer runs frantically into the kitchen.
 Lisa pokes at her breakfast.
   
   Homer: Where the hell are my keys?  Who stole my keys?  Come on, I'm
          late for work!  [lift Maggie and looks underneath]
   Marge: Oh Homer, you'd lose your head if it weren't securely fastened to
          your neck.
   Bart:  Did you check the den?
   Homer: The den!  Great idea!  [heads into the den.  Bart follows]
          [Homer pulls the couch apart]
   Bart:  Warm.
          No, cold.
          Colder.
          Ice cold.
   Homer: You know where my keys are?
   Bart:  No, I'm talking about your breakfast.  [laughs]
   Homer: Grrrrrrrrrr!
   -- ``''
   
 Lisa finds the keys in the front door, putting an end to Bart's amusement.
   
   Marge:  I'm sorry everybody, but I've only got two cupcakes for the three
           of you.
   Bart:   Well Mom, one of us has scarfed down more than enough cupcakes
           over the past three decades to keep his...
   Homer:  Bart!
   Lisa:   Just take mine.  A simple cupcake will bring me no pleasure.
           [Homer and Bart watch Lisa trudge out of the room]
   Homer+Bart: Yeah!  [exchange high-fives]
   -- ``''
   
 Mr. Largo (the music teacher) conducts the school band through a horrid
 rendition of ``My Country 'Tis of Thee''.  Lisa improvises wildly.
   
   Largo: [tapping on music stand]  Lisa.  [taps louder]  LISA SIMPSON!
          [finally attracting her attention]  Lisa, there's no room for
          crazy bebop in ``My Country 'Tis of Thee''.
   Lisa:  But Mr. Largo!  That's what my country's all about.
   Largo: What?!?
   Lisa:  I'm wailing out for the homeless family living out of a car.  The
          idle farmer whose land has been taken away by uncaring
          bureaucrats.  The West Virginia coal-miner caught...
   Largo: Well, that's all fine and good, but Lisa, none of those unpleasant
          people are going to be at the recital next week.  Now class, from
          the top.  Five, six, seven...
   -- ``''
   
 Lisa conforms.

 At lunchtime...
   
   Lisa: Every day at noon a bell rings, and they herd us in here to
         feeding time.  So we sit around like cattle, chewing our cud,
         dreading the inevitable...
   Bart: A-ha!  Food fight!
   -- ``''
   
 Everyone except Lisa gets into the act.  Janey packs a mashed
 potatoes-ball and asks, ``Come on Lis, what are you waiting for?''
 Lisa responds, ``I choose not to participate.''  She is the unhappy
 recipient of a glob of mashed potatoes.

 Phys ed.  Lisa is pelted by multiple utility balls.
   
   Lisa:  OW!  Ooh, ow!  Ooh!
   PE Teacher: [blows whistle]  Lisa!  We are playing dodge-ball here.
          The object of the game is to avoid the ball, by weaving or ducking
          out of its path.
   Lisa:  In other words, to dodge the ball.
   PE Teacher: Listen missy, just tell me why you weren't getting out of the way
          of those balls.
   Lisa:  [despairingly]  I'm too sad.
   PE Teacher: Too sad to play dodgeball?  That's ridiculous. [to the rest of the
          class]  Now let's see some enthusiasm.  Play Ball!
   -- ``''
   
 Several more enthusiastic utility balls hit Lisa.

 At home, Homer and Bart play the ``Super Slugfest'' video boxing game.
   
   Homer: Come on, come on, let's go.
   Bart:  [as announcer]
          In the red trunks, with a record of 48 wins and no losses, the
          undisputed champ of the town, Battling Bart Simpson!
          [whistles] whoopee, wo wo wo!
          And in the lavender trunks, with a record of zero wins and 48
          defeats... oh, correction, &lt;humiliating&gt; defeats, all of them by
          knock-out.
   Homer: Must you do this every time...
   Bart:  Homer ``the human punching bag'' Simpson!
   -- ``''
   
 Round 1.  Homer immediately hits the canvas.  ``Whoa, three seconds folks,
 a new record!''  Homer manages to jiggle the joystick enough to get his
 man off the canvas, to suffer more at the hands of Battling Bart.  Marge
 and Lisa come in, as Homer's boxer bleeds.
   
   Marge:  They sent a note from school.
   Homer:  [to Bart]  What did you do this time you little hoodlum?
   Bart:   I didn't do it, no one saw me do it, there's no way you can prove
           anything!
   -- ``''
   
 But this note is about Lisa.  Even Bart finds it hard to believe.
 When Homer takes the note, Bart literally knocks the video boxing
 character's block off.  Lisa sighs.

 [End of Act One.  Time: 4:48]
   
   Homer:  [reading the note]  Lisa refuses to play dodgeball because she is
           sad.  [end of note]  She doesn't look sad.  I don't see any tears
           in her eyes.
   Lisa:   It's not that kind of sad.  I'm sorry Dad, but you wouldn't
           understand.
   Homer:  Oh sure I would, Princess.  I have feeling too, you know, like
           ``My stomach hurts', or ``I'm going crazy!''
   -- ``''
   
 She climbs up onto her father's knee.  Lisa muses, ``I'm just wondering
 what's the point.  Would it make any difference at all if I never existed?
 How can we sleep at night when there's so much suffering in the world?''
 Unable to respond to these deep questions, Homer says, ``Come on Lisa, ride
 the Homer horsey!  Giddy up!  Wheee!  heh heh heh.''  Marge offers to
 run her a hot bath like when she feels sad.
   
   Lisa:  Sorry Dad, I know you mean well.  [kisses him]
   Homer: Thanks for knowing I mean well.
   -- ``''
   
   Bart:  Gee Homer, it looks like you've got yourself a real problem on
          your hands.
   Homer: You're right... Uhh... Bart!  Vacuum this floor!
   Bart:  Hey Man!  I didn't do anything wrong!
   Homer: In times of trouble you've got to go with what you know.  Now hop
          to it boy!
   -- ``''
   
 With Maggie watching from the couch, Bart grouses as he vacuums the living
 room floor... and a pack of playing cards from the table.  Lisa enters
 wearing her bathrobe.
   
   Bart:   [sarcastically]  Enjoy your bath?
   Lisa:   No, not really.
   Bart:   Oh, too bad.  Well I've certainly had fun vacuuming.  Maybe now
           I'll get the pleasure of scrubbing your tub.
   Lisa:   [to Maggie] So typical of Bart.  All he thinks about is himself.
   Bart:   Hey!  Don't say stuff like that about me to Maggie.  She's on my
           side anyway.
   \&lt;
   Lisa:   Is not!|       |Is not!|       |Is not!
   Bart:          |Is too!|       |Is too!|
   \&gt;
   Bart:   Is too!  Watch, I'll prove it.  Maggie, come to the one you love
           best.
   Maggie: [hops off the couch, looks at Bart]
   Lisa:   No Maggie!  Come here girl, come to me.
   Bart:   [shaking a rattler]  Come on Maggie, the choice is obvious.
   Lisa:   [beckoning her]  No Maggie, don't go for the glitter, look for
           substance.
   Maggie: [looks at them both, uncertain]
   Lisa:   [giving up] All right Maggie, just go to Bart.
   Bart:   Egg-zactly, come to the one you love best.
   Maggie: [looks at them both, then walks away and embraces the TV set]
   -- ``''
   
 Homer and Bart sit down to play another game of video boxing.  Homer
 wields his joystick furiously.  Bart uses a single finger to dispatch
 his opponent and dances on the grave of the defeated.  Homer's
 excuse is the ``infernal racket'' coming from upstairs.

 Homer runs into Lisa's room.
   
   Homer: Lisa!  What did I tell you about playing that saxamuhthing in the
          house?
   Lisa:  I was just playing the blues... Dad. [sobs]
   Homer: Lisa, I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to yell.  Go ahead, play your
          blues if it'll make you happy.
   Lisa:  No, that's okay, Dad.  I'll just work on my fingering, unless my
          fingers clacking on the keys is too loud for you.
   Homer: Let's hear it.  [Lisa clacks away]  You just clack as loud as you
          want, Lis.
   -- ``''
   
 The tones of another saxophone reach through the bedroom window.
 ``Gotta find that sound,'' says Lisa.  Out the window, to the treehouse,
 then down the ladder.  She treks through Springfield, locating another
 musician sitting on the Springfield bridge.
   
   Lisa:   That was beautiful.  What's it called?
   Murphy: Oh, it's a little tune that I call ``The `I Never Had an Italian
           Suit' Blues''.
   -- ``''
   
 Marge sleeps restlessly.  She dreams of her childhood.  Marge's mother
 (who looks just like Marge, but with a puffier hairdo) tells her
 daughter, ``Wait Margey, before we go out that door, let's put our
 happy face on, because people know how good a mommy you have by the size
 of your smile.''  Young Marge sports a ridiculous smile.
   
 Homer meanwhile lapses into a video game nightmare, except the video
 characters are real, not pixels.  The two combatants are, of course,
 Bart and Homer.
   
   Homer:  [in a dream] What the?!?!  [Homer is a video boxing character]
   Bart:   [his opponent] Put up your dukes, Homer.
   Homer:  Agggh!  Bart!  Go easy on me!  I'm your Dad!
   Bart:   I &lt;am&gt; going easy on ya.  [pow] You're so old, [pow] and slow,
           [pow] and weak, [pow] and pathetic.  [Bart winds up for the kill]
   Homer:  No!  Son!  No!  [the fist impacts]
           [wakes up screaming]
           Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaauuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuugh!
   -- ``''
   
 Homer promptly settles back to sleep as if nothing happened.
 Marge wakes up Homer, wiping off the drool.
   
   You know Marge, getting old is a terrible thing.  I think the
   saddest day of my life was when I realized I could beat my Dad at
   most things, and Bart experienced that at the age of four.
   -- Homer, ``''
   
 Marge is still trying to figure out what's bothering Lisa.
   
   Marge:  I don't know... Bart's such a handful, and Maggie needs
           attention, but all the while, our little Lisa's becoming a young
           woman.
   Homer:  Oh, so that's it, this is some kind of underwear thing.
   -- ``''
   
 Homer returns to sleep, but Marge remains awake.

 Murphy tutors the fine art of the sax to Lisa on Springfield Bridge.
   
   Lisa:    [improvises]
   Murphy:  Now now now, low B flat.
   Lisa:    [jams down low]
   Murphy:  Okay, Lisa.  Altissimo register.
   Lisa:    [another wild riff]
   Murphy:  [applauding]  Very nice, very nice.  I once ruptured myself
            doing that.
   -- All you ever wanted to know about sax, ``''
   
 Lisa thanks Mr. Murphy for the compliment, but he would rather be known
 as...
   
   Murphy:  My friends call me `Bleeding Gums'.
   Lisa:    Ewwww, how'd you get a name like that?
   Murphy:  Well let me put it this way... You ever been to the dentist?
   Lisa:    Yeah.
   Murphy:  Not me.  I suppose I should go to one, but I've got enough pain
            in my life as it is.
   -- ``''
   
 Lisa adds, ``I have problems too.''  Murphy responds, ``Well I can't help
 you kid.  I'm just a terrific horn player with tones of soul, but I can
 jam widcha.''  They do.
   
   Murphy:  Oh, I'm so lonely,
            Since my baby left me.
            I got no money,
            And nothing is free.
            Oh, I've been so alone
            Since the day I was born.
            All I got is this rusty,
            This rusty old horn.
   Lisa:    I got a bratty brother.
            He bugs me everyday.
            And this morning my own mother,
            Gave my last cupcake away.
            My Dad acts like he belongs,
            He belongs in the zoo.
            I'm the sa-a-a-addest kid,
            In gra-a-a-de number two.
   -- ``'
   
 But none of this makes Lisa feel any better.
   
   The Blues isn't about feeling better, it's about making other
   people feel &lt;worse&gt;, and making a few bucks while you're at it.
   -- Bleeding Gums Murphy, ``''
   
 Marge drives by.
   
   Marge:  Lisa!  Get away from that jazz man!
   Lisa:   But Mom!  Can I stay a little longer?  Can I Mom, can I?
   Marge:  Come on, come on.  We were worried about you.
           [to Bleeding Gums Murphy]
           Nothing personal, I just fear the unfamiliar.
   -- ``''
   
 Lisa gets in, and Murphy solos through the night.

 [End of Act Two.  Time: 13:03]

 Homer chows down on Pork Rinds Light in front of the TV set.
   
   Kent:  ... through downtown Springfield today gutting Symphony Hall, the
          Springfield Museum of Natural History, the Springfield Arts
          Center, and Barney's Bowl-o-rama.
   Homer: Waugh!  [chokes]  Oh no!  [walks into kitchen]  Marge!  Marge, you
          all right?
   Marge: No, I'm very upset.
   Homer: Oh then you've heard.  Oh God!  What are we going to do?  The
          lanes were kinda warped, but all the food...
   Marge: I'm upset about Lisa.
   Homer: [realizing]  Oh, me too.
   Bart:  Me three, whatawe talking about?
   Homer: Bart!
   -- ``''
   
   Marge: Do you think you could be nice enough to your sister, Bart?
   Bart:  Oh yeah, easy.
   Marge: You do love her don't you?
   Bart:  [whining] Oh Mom...
   Marge: Well you do, don't you?
   Bart:  [uncomfortably]  Don't make me say it.  You know the answer, I
          know the answer, he knows the answer, let's just drop it, ok?
   Marge: Okay, Bart, you don't have to say it, but you do have to have a
          loving attitude.  Be nice to your sister.
   Bart:  [reluctantly]  Okey dokey.
   -- ``''
   
 Bart sees Lisa coming down the stairs with her saxophone.  ``Hi, man!''
 But she doesn't want his pity.  Bart offers to cheer her up.

 Moe picks up the phone.
   
   Moe:   Yeah, Moe's Tavern, Moe speaking.
   Bart:  Is Jock there?
   Moe:   Who?
   Bart:  Jock, last name Strap.
   Moe:   Uh, hold on.  [to everyone in the bar]  Uh, Jock... Strap...
          Hey guys I'm looking for a Jock Strap.  [laughs from all]
          Oh... wait a minute... Jock Strap...
          It's you isn't it ya cowardly little runt?  When I get a hold of you,
          I'm gonna gut you like a fish and drink your blood.
   -- ``''
   
 Bart rolls on the floor laughing.  Lisa isn't impressed.  ``Where's your
 sense of humor man?''  Marge leaves with Lisa for band practice.
 Meanwhile, Homer pays a visit to the Noiseland Video Arcade.
   
   Homer: Give me some quarters... I'm doing my laundry.
   Clerk: Yeah, right.  [gives him the quarters]
   Homer: [looks around] Where's the video boxing?
   Clerk: Over there in the corner.  If I were you I really would use
          those quarters for laundry.
   Homer: [sotto voce]  Wise guy.
   -- ``''
   
 The line for video boxing is quite long.  Homer learns that the kid at
 the game has played over two thousand fights and is still on his first
 quarter.
   
   Howie:  Ok, who's next?  [every one raises their hands, `memememememe']
   Homer:  [rising from above the crowd]  No, me!  No, meeee!  Now listen...
           can you teach me how to fight like you do?
   Howie:  No.
   Homer:  Aw, come on...
   Howie:  I'll tell you what.  I'll do it if you'll bark like a dog.
   Homer:  Whyyoulittle... Woof woof woof!
   Howie:  Hah!  You've got yourself a deal, Fido.
   -- ``''
   
 Much later, the arcade is empty, save for Homer and Howie.  Homer has
 run out of quarters, but with the tips he's learned, he's ready to
 ``pound the tar out of a cer-tain little smartypants tonight''.
 Howie's mother scolds her son for wasting his money, and says to Homer,
 ``You should be ashamed of yourself.''  Homer makes his escape.
 ``Excuse me, I think I hear my wife calling.''

 Marge drives Lisa to band practice.  Silence.
   
   Lisa:   Ahem.  [Marge waits for her to say something, but Lisa turns
           away]
   Marge:  Now Lisa, listen to me, this is important.  I want you to smile
           today.
   Lisa:   But I don't feel like smiling.
   Marge:  Well it doesn't matter how you feel inside, you know?  It's what
           shows up on the surface that counts.  That's what my mother
           taught me.  Take all your bad feelings and push them down, all
           the way down, past your knees until you're almost walking on them.
           And then you'll fit in, and you'll be invited to parties, and
           boys will like you, and happiness will follow.
   Lisa:   [feeble attempt at a smile]
   Marge:  No, come on.  You can do better than that.
   Lisa:   [a much brighter smile]
   Marge:  Aww, that's my girl.  [rubs Lisa's hair]
   Lisa:   [through her teeth]  I feel more popular already.
   -- ``''
   
 At the entrance to the school building.
   
   Boy1:  Hey, nice smile.
   Lisa:  Thanks.
   Boy2:  Hey, what are you talking to her for?  She's just going to say
          something weird.
   Lisa:  Not me!
   Boy1:  You know, I used to think you were some sort of a Brainiac, but, I
          guess you're okay, and...
   Lisa:  Uh-huh.
   Boy2:  Hey, why don't you come over to my house after practice.  You can
          do my homework.
   Lisa:  [forced]  Okay.
   -- ``''
   
 Marge (who had been observing) fumes.  (``Mmmmmmmm!'')
   
   Miss Simpson, I hope we won't have a repeat of yesterday's
   outburst of `Unbridled Creativity'.
   -- Mr. Largo, ``''
   
 Lisa responds, ``No, sir.''  Growling, Marge U-turns the car, pulls Lisa
 inside and speeds off.  Notes Mr. Largo, ``Hummph.  So that's where she
 gets it.''

 Marge stops the car.  ``Lisa, I apologize to you, I was wrong, I take it
 all back.  Always be yourself.  If you want to be sad, honey, be sad.
 We'll ride it out with you.  And when you get finished feeling sad, we'll
 still be there.  From now on, let me do the smiling for both of us.''
 Lisa smiles and embraces her.  ``Okay, Mom.''  ``I said you could stop
 smiling, Lisa.''  ``I feel like smiling.''  Marge is touched.

 The Main Event.  Homer and Bart prepare for one final round of video
 boxing.  Homer looks like a man with an ace up his sleeve.
   
   Bart:   I'm gonna knock you out one more time and that's it, this is
           getting boring, man!
   Homer:  [smirking] Try not to kill me too hard, son.  Heh heh heh.
   -- ``''
   
 Game console:  Ding-ding, ROUND1.  (Akbar's speech balloon says `Fight!')

 Bart lunges, but Homer ducks out of the way and returns with a jab,
 knocking Bart onto the ropes.  Homer wallops Bart.  Marge and Lisa enter.
   
   Marge:  I'd like your attention, please.
   Homer:  Quiet Marge!  This is my big moment!  Bart the Bloody Pulp
           Simpson is on the ropes.  He's hoping I'll put him out of his
           misery.  Wow, you're in luck Bart!  Here comes my right!
           [Marge pulls the plug]  Oh, no!!!!
           My game!  My game!  I could've beat the boy!  Marge, how could
           you!  I was so close!
   Marge:  I'm sorry, but this is more important than that silly loud game.
   Bart:   You're right Mom.  I'd just like to use this occasion to announce
           my retirement, undefeated from the world of video boxing.
           [Homer collapses into a whimper]
   -- ``''
   
 Marge tells Homer to clam down.  Lisa has an idea for a fun night out.

 At the Jazz Hole, Bleeding Gums Murphy on stage.  ``This next song was

 EPISODE TITLE: Call of the Simpsons


EPISODE SUMMARY: 



 While Homer waters the flowers, Bart (unhappily) mows the lawn with a manual
 mower.  Todd putters past atop the Flanders' sit-down mower.  Bart asks
 Homer why they can't have a decent mower, and Homer tells Bart to behappy
 with what he has, ``Don't try to keep up with the Flandereses [sic].''
 Just then, Ned pulls up in his shiny new RV, and Homer is flabbergasted.
 Ned rattles off the features, including the satellite dish on the roof.

   How can you afford something like this, Ned?  I mean, I get your mail
   once in a while, and you make only $27 a week more than I do.
   -- Homer, ``''

 The answer is simple:  Credit.

 Homer takes the family to ``Bob's RV Round-Up''.  The salesman spotseasy
 quarry.  Homer asks to see their best RV, better than Flanders'.  Cowboy
 Bob shows them ``The Ultimate Behemoth'', a two-story monster.

   Bart:  Does it have its own satellite dish, sir?
   Bob:   You can tell your son it has its own satellite---the VanStar 1
          launched last Feburary.
   -- The Simpsons shop for an RV, ``''

 Cowboy Bob ignores Marge's repeated questions as to the Behemoth's price.

   Homer: Does it have a deep fryer?
   Bob:   Four.  One for each part of the chicken.
   -- The Simpsons shop for an RV, ``''

 Cowboy Bob shows them inside.  Fireplace.  Giant-screen TV.  Full-sized
 refrigerator.  Crystal chandelier.

   Bart: Aye, Carumba!
   Lisa: This is better than our house!
   -- The Simpsons shop for an RV, ``''

 Homer finally asks how much it costs.  Cowboy Bob lays it on thick and
 takes Homer to the credit office.  There, he assures Homer that the
 credit check is purely a formality, but it's part of the procedure.
 ``I don't own the place, even though my name's up there.  Long story.''

   Bob:   [running a credit check]  [presses `Enter']
          [sirens wail and lights flash]
   Homer: Is that a good siren?  Am I approved?
   Bob:   You ever known a siren to be good?
   -- The only good siren is a dead siren, ``''

 ``That was the computer [...] telling me, sell the vehicle to this fellow
 and you're out of business.''

   Homer: Don't you have something that isn't out of my price range?
          I don't want to go away empty-handed, Bob.
   Bob:   Take it easy, willya, huh?  You'll ruin this feeling I'm getting
          from ya...
   -- Shopping for an RV, ``''

 He shows them a bucket of bolts that is miraculously still in one piece.
 Homer asks, ``Is it used?''

   Simpson, you'll never own a better RV, and I don't mean that in a good way.
   I mean, literally, buddy.  This is for you, you know.  It's this or a wagon.
   -- Cowboy Bob sells Homer an RV, ``''

 Cowboy Bob pulls every slimy tactic in the book to panic Homer into buying
 the RV.  The rest of the family don't seem too happy by the turn of events.

 The RV coughs to a stop in front of the Flanders' house, where Homertakes
 the opportunity to gloat.  He then turns his attention to his family.

   Homer: Everybody ready?
   Bart:  I hate this.  I don't want to go.
   Homer: That's the spirit!
   -- Going camping, ``''

   Ready or not, Nature, here we come!
   -- Homer takes the family camping, ``''

 The RV (packed to the gills) putters down the street.

 Traffic has backed up behind the slow-moving RV.

   Bart:  Turkey farm?       Skunks?       Slaughterhouse?
   Lisa:                No.           No.                   No.
   Marge: What are you kids doing?
   Lisa:  We're playing ``Name that Odor''.
   Bart:  Dad's feet?
   Homer: Bart!
   Lisa:  You win, Bart.
   Homer: Lisa!
   -- Games to play in the car, ``''

 Bart whines, ``Are we there yet?''  Homer replies, ``Go back to your smell
 game.''

 The RV makes a turn off the main road, and it wanders through the woods.
 Marge consults her map.

   Marge: Homer, I'm telling you, this is not the Interstate.
   Homer: Pffffft.  Maps.
   -- Marge the navigator noties something amiss, as the RV drives through the
      woods, ``''

   Shouldn't we stop somewhere and ask for directions?
   -- Marge the navigator, as Homer drives the RV through the woods,
      ``''

 ``Don't worry, this is an all-terrain vehicle!''  Homer tests the hypothesis
 by driving into a lake.  Marge's feet get wet.

   Lisa:  Mom, I'm scared.
   Marge: Don't worry.  We all are.
   -- Safety in numbers, ``''

 The RV returns to dry land, and Homer throws the RV into high gear.
 (Amazing!  It has more than one gear!)  The RV crashes through bushes.
 Homer asks, ``Whaddya think, should we stop here?''  Everybody yells,
 ``YEEEEEEEEEES!!!!!''  Homer slams on the brakes.  Curious, the horizon
 is nowhere to be seen through the front window.  The RV tips forward:
 It's balanced precariously on the edge of a cliff.  Everyone screams.
 And screams.  And screams some more.

   Homer: [speaking softly and slowly]
          When I give the word, everyone ever-so-slowly open the door
          and slide out.  On the count of three...  One...
   SoundFX: (*rustle*)  (*rustle*)  (*slam*)  (*slam*)  (*slam*)
   Homer: [turns around:  Everyone has already left]
   -- Taking charge in a crisis, ``''

 Homer slips out just before the RV tips over the edge, fallllllllllllls,
 and explodes.

   Lisa: [glumly] The Simpsons have entered the forest.
   -- But will the forest survive?  ``''

 [End of Act One.  Time: 7:09]

 Homer tries to put a good face on things.

   Homer: Yes sir!  This is a real adventure!  Why, I bet there are people who
          would trade everything they have in the world for an adventure like
          this.
   Bart:  You mean like &lt;we&gt; just did?
   -- The Simpsons have entered the forest, sans RV, ``''

 Trying to cheer up Maggie, Lisa points up into the sky.  ``Look, Maggie.
 Birdies!''  Vultures circle overhead.

   Marge: Oh Homer... What are we going to do?
   Homer: Now, don't worry.  Our situation isn't as bad as it seems.
          And you're forgetting---I'm an experienced woodsman!
          Now, you all stay here for a minute while I go over this way to
          try to get my bearings.
          [walks away fifteen meters]
          [sits down]
          What am I going to do!?  I've murdered us all!
   Echo:  I've murdered us all! ... murdered us all!
   Homer: Shut up!
   Echo:  Shut up! ... Shut up!
   Homer: D'oh!
   Echo:  D'oh! ... D'oh!
   -- Echo Canyon, ``''

 That evening, Homer ``finishes'' building some sort of shelter-like thing
 out of twigs and a fallen log.  Not very impressive.

   Lisa:  Remember, Dad.  The handle of the Big Dipper points towards
          the North Star.
   Homer: Heh heh, that's nice, Lisa.  But we're not in astronomy class.
          We're in the woods.
   -- ``''

 Homer and Bart leave to get help.  Maggie follows.  Lisa wonders if it's
 okay to let Maggie go with them; Marge (sweeping the area clear witha
 twig-rake) says they'll be back soon.  ``She's in good hands.''  Vultures
 circle overhead.

 Homer and Bart walk through the woods.  Homer tells Bart that animals can
 sense fear, so don't be afraid.  Maggie, following behind, sucks her
 pacifier.  Homer mistakes the sound for a rattlesnake and panics.  Bart
 says to himself, ``I'm not afraid... I'm not afraid.''  Homer corrects him.
 ``Run, you fool!''  The two vanish into the distance.

 Homer and Bart run out of breath, and Homer declares that they are only
 steps away from civilization.

   When you're an experienced woodsman, you get a feel for these things.
   It's like a third sense.
   -- Homer, ``''

 They step through the bushes---and fall off a cliff, landing in the river
 below.  Then go over a waterfall.

 Back at the campsite, Marge and Lisa continue cleaning, and they seem to
 have done a superb job of making the area liveable.  (Marge arrangessome
 pine cones atop a mantle, and arranges three squirrels neatly atop alog.)
 Marge notes that the boys have been gone for quite a while.  ``I hope
 Maggie isn't slowing them up.''

 Maggie, wandering along, encounters a ferocious bear.  So she reaches into
 her baggie and sticks a pacifier in its mouth.  The pacifier lives up to
 its name.

 Homer sufaces at the bottom of the falls, and sees Bart's lucky red hat
 floating past.  He fears the worst, searches for Bart, and swims ashore
 bemoaning the loss of his son.  A voice calls from across the lake.
 ``Don't have a cow, Dad.''  ``What the... D'oh!  You're alive!  And,heh
 heh, buck naked.''  In fact, so also is Homer.

 The bear carries Maggie back to its lair, where the other bears roar
 ferociously.  But the first bear motions the others to stop.

 Homer helps Bart dress himself in ferns, mud, and moss.  Bart is hungry,
 so Homer bends a sapling into a trap.

   What are we going to do, hang ourselves?
   -- Bart watches Homer build a trap out of a young sapling,
      ``''

 The two hide and wait.  Soon, a bunny rabbit hops by and springs the trap.
 The tree propels the poor rodent far, far, far, far away.  On to Plan B.

   I'll go into the bushes over there, make a lot of noise, and flush out
   a rabbit.  When he comes out, you step on him.
   -- Homer instructs Bart on his role in catching dinner,
      ``''

 Homer goes into a bush, and is promptly attacked by a chipmunk, a rabbit,
 a raccoon, and a snake.  Homer rolls around frantically.  Bart watches.

 A man, a woman, and their baby sit by a tent.  The man is somewhat miffed
 that they haven't seen even one squirrel, but his wife reminds him that
 the ranger warned them to watch out for bears.  A bear watches.  Theman
 can't take the warning seriously and calls out, ``Hello, bears!'' inviting
 them to come attack him.  ``All right, all right, you made your point.''
 While the wife burps the baby, the bear sneaks up from behind and takes
 the bottle of formula.

 The bear brings the bottle to Maggie, who removes her pacifier and starts
 drinking the bottle.  Meanwhile, the bears bring Maggie all sorts ofbaby
 toys, and a lantern.  The bears sit around Maggie, as the cave glowsin
 the darkness.

 Marge and Lisa sit in front of a fire.  Lisa wonders if the boys areokay,
 but Marge reassures her.  After all, they built a fire without knowing a
 thing about Nature.  Imagine what Homer, an experienced woodsman, could do.
 The two go to sleep.

 Homer and Bart lie, shivering, on the ground.
 (Many are cold, but few are frozen.)  (Sorry, a tag I never got to use.)

 Maggie pulls a bear's paw over her as a blanket.

 The next morning, Homer and Bart continue through the woods.

   Are we there yet?
   -- Bart wanders with Homer aimlessly through the woods,
      ``''

 Homer spots a beehive.  ``Honey!  We're saved!''  He sticks his fist into
 the hive and sticks a handful of honey (and bees) into his mouth.

   Tangy.
   -- Homer eats a mouthful of honey---and bees, ``''

 Homer (his voice muffled because his mouth is filled with honey and bees)
 yells for water, and Bart points him ``that-a-way, man.''

 Homer dives into a muddy stream and emerges a mud-covered beast.  His
 appearance is captured on videotape by a nearby nature-lover, who runs
 away in panic.

 News bulletin.  Bigfoot has been spotted.  The videotape is shown.

   Now, the naturalist who took these absolutely extraordinary pictures was
   impressed by the creature's uncivilized look, its foul language,
   and most of all, its indescribable stench.
   -- Newscaster reports that Bigfoot (Homer) has been sighted,
      ``''

 (Foul language?)  The ``Springfield Weekly'' tabloid has offered a $5000
 reward for the capture of Bigfoot.

   We now return you to the President's address, already in progress.
   -- Newscaster interrupts to report Bigfoot sighting, ``''

 Homer and Bart sit, glum, on a log.

 [End of Act Two.  Time: 15:57]

 The campground has turned into a media circus.  The ranger notes that Marge
 and Lisa were lucky to be found---before Bigfoot got them.  He showsMarge
 the newspaper headline and photo.  Says Marge, ``Why, that's my husband!''
 A new headline:  ``I married Bigfoot.''  Marge is surrounded by reporters.
 ``His name isn't Bigfoot.  His name is Homer.''  Another headline:
 ``Bigfoot's wife pleads:  `Call him Homer!' ''.  ``What does it eat?'' asks
 a reporter.  Marge doesn't understand the commotion, but answers the
 question anyway.  Next headline: ``The Bigfoot Diet: `Pork Chops Aplenty' ''.
 Bears loom menacingly, and a TV reporter tells his gopher to get ridof them.

   No bears.  We're taping!  All bears off the set!
   -- ``''

 No one seems to notice that Maggie is riding atop one of the bears.
 The TV reporter interviews Marge, and asks her what their marriage is like.

 Bart and Homer lumber through the forest.  (Homer is still covered in mud.)

   Bart:  Are we there yet?
   Homer: Just a little further.
   Bart:  Are we there yet?
   Homer: Just a little further.
   Bart:  Are we there yet?
   Homer: Just a little further.
   Bart:  Are we there yet?
   Homer: Just a little further.
   -- Wandering aimlessly through the forest, ``''

 Homer smells food, and he and Bart follow the scent, eyes closed, into
 the bears' lair.  They back away slowly (``Nice grizzlies...'') and are
 surprised when Maggie waves the bears off.  Maggie leaves with Bart and
 Homer.

   Later, grizzly dudes.
   -- Bart bids farewell to a pack of bears, ``''

 Maggie turns around and waves good-bye to her friends.  One bear still
 sucks on a pacifier.

 As the trio near civilization, one person shouts, ``It's him!  It's
 Bigfoot!''  Homer is quickly subdued by a crowd of people.  The ranger
 tells Bart they saved him just in time.

   What the hell are you talking about, sir?
   -- Bart, ``''

 Homer breaks free and runs off.  They shoot him with a tranquilizer dart.
 Bart rushes to his fallen father's side.

   Avenge me, son.  Avenge my death... ZZZZzzzzzz...
   -- Homer (Bigfoot) is hit with a tranquilizer dart, ``''

 On television, the reporter explains that scientists from around the world
 are gathered at the Springfield Primate Institute to study the creature,
 and are soon to announce their findings.

   Dr. Marvin Monroe:  After extensive biological and anatomical testing,
       I regret to announce that our findings are... inconclusive.
       This thing may or may not be human.
   German scientist: Dat's what he tinks.  I say it's none other than Bigfoot
        himself.
   French scientist: Oh, no, I disagree.  I think it is a man.
        The eyes have a glimmer of human intelligence.
   -- On the capture of Bigfoot (Homer), ``''

 Homer and Marge watch the news report in bed.

   Cheer up, Homer.  At least they let you go.
   -- Marge, after Homer is captured and believed to be Bigfoot,
      ``''

   This specimen is either a below-average human being or a brilliant beast.
   -- German scientist who examined Homer/Bigfoot, ``''

 Homer turns off the set, depressed.  Marge smiles and kisses Homer
 good-night.  ``My brilliant beast.''

 EPISODE TITLE: The Telltale Head


EPISODE SUMMARY: 

   

 At night, Bart and Homer walk down the streets of downtown Springfield.
 Bart carries the head of a statue.  Homer reassures Bart, ``You know, Bart,
 when I was your age, I pulled a few boners.  But I think you'll find that
 people are pretty decent if you give them half a---''  They turn the
 corner and find an angry, torch-wielding mob.   Running out of places
 to run, Homer and Bart run onto the town square, which sports a headless
 statue.  Each tells the other to go, but both refuse to leave the other
 to die.  ``We'll die together, like a father and son should.''

 The mob closes in, and Bart climbs to the top of the statue.
   
   Bart:   Murderous mob, I beg you to spare our lives, at least until you've
           heard the story of how we ended up with the head of our belov\'ed
           town founder.
   Barney: How long will this story take?
   Bart:   Uh... About twenty-three minutes and five seconds.
   -- Does that include commercials?  ``''
   
 They agree. It all started Sunday morning.  Marge calls the kids downstairs.
 The three kids come down, all dressed adorably.  (Bart uses the banister
 express.)  Marge gives them a quick inspection.
   
   Marge: Bart, assume the position.
   Bart:  [turns and leans against the wall, legs spread]
   Marge: [frisks Bart]
   -- Leaving for church, ``''
   
 Marge finds a slingshot and a Radioactive Man comic.  Meanwhile, Homer
 hops nervously on the couch, watching football.  His team fumbles,
 and the opponents recover it for a touchdown.  Marge is upset that Homer
 wagered $50 on the game, but Homer insists it's not gambling.  The
 win is guaranteed.  (His team fumbles again, recovered for a touchdown.)

 In the car, Marge politely complains/scolds that she always has to drag
 everyone to church.  Homer tunes the football game on the car radio.
 When his team scores, he honks the horn and flashes his headlights.
 In the back seat, Bart also grins widely, listening to his Walkman.
   
   Announcer: This could be the most remarkable comeback since Lazarus rose
              from the dead!
   Homer:     Laza-who?
   -- Driving to church, ``''
   
 They arrive at the First Church of Springfield.  Bart dances silently
 to the music.
   
   Marge: [confiscates Bart's personal stereo]
          Were you going to listen to rock music in Sunday School?
   Bart:  Maybe.
   Marge: Can you believe this, Homer? ... Homer?  Homer?
   Homer: [in the car, bashes his head on the steering wheel in frustration]
   Marge: [goes to the car]  Homer, were you planning on sitting in the
          car until the [football] game is over?
   Homer: Maybe.
   -- Great minds think alike, ``''
   
 Marge tosses the radio into the car, and Homer pockets it.

 In Sunday School, Miss Allbright tries to explain to the kids that
 animals don't go to heaven.  Heaven is for people.
   
   Milhouse:  Will there be cavemen in heaven?
   Sunday School Teacher:  Certainly not!
   Bart: Uh, ma'am?  What if you're a really good person, but
         you get into a really, really bad fight and your leg gets
         gangrene and it has to be amputated.  Will it be waiting for
         you in heaven?
   Sunday School Teacher: For the last time, Bart, yes!
   -- Playing by the rules, ``''
   
 Meanwhile, Reverend Lovejoy gives his sermon, titled, ``Gambling:  The
 Eighth Deadly Sin.''  Slowly push in on Homer in the congregation, wearing
 Bart's headphones and listening to the football game.  The audio changes
 to the play-by-play.  Reverend Lovejoy's arm motions serve to illustrate
 the football action.  Homer's team sets up for a game-winning field goal.
 Homer and the congregation pray.  The kick is good, and Homer stands up,
 yelling, ``It's good!  It's good!''  All eyes turn to him.  ``It's good...
 to see you all in church.''

 Meanwhile, Miss Allbright is completely exasperated.
   
   Sunday School Teacher:  [very tired]  The ventriloquist goes to heaven,
         but the dummy doesn't.
   Bart: [raises his hand]  Ooh-ooh-ooh!  Me!
   Sunday School Teacher:  Bart?
   Bart: What about a robot with a human brain?
   Sunday School Teacher:
         [at the breaking point] I don't know!  All these questions!
         Is a little blind faith too much to ask!?!
   -- ``''
   
 The service has ended.  In the car, Marge scolds Homer, then...
   
   Marge: Lisa, Bart, what did you two learn in Sunday School today?
   Lisa:  The answers to deep theological questions.
   Bart:  Yeah, among other things, apes can't get into heaven.
   Homer: What?  Those cute little monkeys?  That's terrible.
          Who told you that?
   Bart:  Our teacher.
   Homer: I can understand how they wouldn't let in those wild jungle apes, but
          what about those really smart ones who live among us?
          Who roller-skate and smoke cigars?
   -- And work in nuclear power plants, ``''
   
 The car stops for a traffic light in front of a movie theater.
   
   Bart:  Cool, man, Space Mutants 4.  Let me off!  Let me off!
   Marge: No way, Jose.
   Homer: Marge, they're only space mutants.
   Marge: Uh uh.  I know what those movies are like.
          Killing innocent people, eating human flesh.
          You'll just get a lot of bad ideas.
   -- ``''
   
 At home, Bart approaches Homer, who is resting on the couch.  Bart asks
 for $5, and Homer winkingly hopes Bart doesn't spend it on a certain
 movie.  (``Perish the thought!'')  Bart goes upstairs, undresses in the
 hallway, enter his room
 naked, puts on his shirt and shorts, grabs his skateboard, and swings
 out the window, without once breaking stride.

 Bart skateboards cheerily to the theater, where he is greeted by Jimbo
 and Kerny, the worst kids in town.  Momentarily distracted, Bart
 crashes into a lamppost.  ``Didn't hurt.''  Dolph pops his head out
 the side door of the theater.  ``The coast is clear.''
   
   Bart:  You guys are sneaking in?
   Kerny: Yeah, only saps pay to see movies.
   Jimbo: Hey, Bart, come on!
   Bart:  But sneaking into movies is practically stealing, man.
   Kerny: Practically?
   Jimbo: It &lt;is&gt; stealing.
   Bart:  Well, okay.  I just wanted to make sure we aren't deluding ourselves.
   -- An irrefutable argument, ``''
   
 [End of Act One.  Time: 8:04]

 The movie plays to a nearly empty theater.  The Space Mutant makes its
 surprise appearance.  At the same time, the usher grabs our
 quartet and tosses them out.  Says Dolph, ``We'll take our
 business elsewhere.''

 The quartet go into the Kwik-E-Mart, where Bart buys some Squishees with
 the $5 Homer gave him.  While Apu fills the order, the others shoplift
 like mad.  Bart pays for the drinks, and finds that the guys have left.
 He finds them in the parking lot, enjoying their booty.  They thank him
 for covering for them while they used the ``five finger discount''.

 They go into the town square, where Dolph, Kerny, and Jimbo throw rocks
 at the statue of Jebediah Springfield, town founder.  Jimbo hands Bart
 a rock, and he throws it.  A local shopkeeper chases them away.

 The gang lie on their backs, admiring the clouds.  Various shapes seen
 include a cherry bomb, a guy with a switchblade stuck in his back,
 a schoolbus going over a cliff with kids screaming, and a headless
 statue of Jebediah Springfield.  Jimbo, Kerny, and Dolph think it'd
 be cool if someone cut his head off.  When Bart leaps to Jebediah's
 defense, the other razz him.  ``Man, I thought you were cool.''  Bart
 trudges off.

 Bart pays another visit to the statue, and gets an idea.

 Back at home...
   
   Homer: [reading The Bowl Earth Catalog]
          Wow, look at these bowling balls, Maggie!
          Can you think of a better way for Daddy to spend his
          hard-won fifty bucks?
          [turns the page]
          Gasp!  Now I've seen everything.
          Black, marbleized with a liquid center.  The Stealth Bowler.
          The pins don't know what hit 'em.
   -- ``''
   
 Bart comes home.
   
   Bart:  I was wondering.  How important is it to be popular?
   Homer: I'm glad you asked, son.  Being popular is the most important thing
          in the world!
   Bart:  Like, sometimes, you could do stuff that you think is pretty bad,
          so other kids will like you better?
   Homer: You're not talking about killing anyone, are you?
   Bart:  No.
   Homer: Are you!
   Bart:  No!
   Homer: Then run along, you little scamp!  [musses Bart's hair]
          A boy without mischief is like a bowling ball without a liquid center.
   -- ``''
   
   A boy without mischief is like a bowling ball without a liquid center.
   -- Homer, ``''
   
 At 3am, Bart, clad in black ninja garb, sneaks out of his room.  He
 accidentally steps on the cat, but grabs it and covers its mouth before
 it can scream out.  He release the cat outside and climbs out the window.
 Bart reaches the town square and unsheathes...  A hacksaw!  He climbs
 the statue and saws off the head.  We pull back from the town square
 as the sawing continues.  (*clunk*)  ``What have I done?''

 [End of Act Two.  Time: 13:33]

 In bed, Bart wakes up and is startled by the head next to him.  Marge
 calls him down to breakfast, where Homer and Lisa enjoy their morning
 meal.
   
   Homer: Ooh, look at this one!  The Hammer of Thor!
          It will sends your pins to... Valhalla?  Lisa?
   Lisa:  Valhalla is where Vikings go when they die.
   Homer: Ooh, that's some ball!
   -- Reading The Bowl Earth Catalog, ``''
   
 Bart arrives, carrying a large knapsack containing something heavy and

 The radio reports the ``act of senseless vandalism'', and
 all are shocked.

 Even the reporter is unable to hold back his tears.
 Bart asks why everyone's so excited.  It's just a statue.
   
   Just a statue?  Is the Statue of Liberty just a statue?
   Is the Leaning Tower of Pizza [sic] just a statue?
   -- Homer, ``''
   
 Bart hears the school bus and says, ``Come on, Lis.''  Lisa sadly
 leave for school.

 In the tavern, Moe tries to get everyone to cheer up.  Barney asks
 for a beer, ``And make sure there's a head on it.''  Moe thinks this
 is funny.  No one else does.

 At the Springfield Retirement Home, Grampa Simpson joins the outrage.

 Bart pays a visit to Jimbo, Kerny and Dolph, who say they wish they could
 see the guy who cut off the head.  Bart unzips his knapsack.  Kerny
 continues, ``We'd break every bone in his stupid little body!''  Bart
 quickly zips the knapsack shut.  Bart reminds them of their wish from the
 previous day, but Kerny explains, ``That was just cloud talk.''
 Jimbo asks what's in the bag.  Bart hears a voice.  ``It's the head
 of Jebediah Springfield...'' Bart dashes off, past a crowd which has
 formed around the now headless statue.  Bart tries to convince himself
 that the voice is just his imagination.  In the crowd is Monty Burns,
 who breaks down in tears.  Smithers, as always, is by his side.  He holds
 a hanky to Burns' nose.  ``Blow, sir.''  (*honk*)

 Bart returns home, and Lisa invites him to watch Krusty the Clown.
   
   There is someone out there in Krusty-Land who has committed an atrocity!
   If you know who cut off Jebediah's head, I don't care if it's your brother,
   your sister, your daddy, or your mommy, turn him in!
   [brightly]  Krusty will send you a free slide whistle,
   just like Sideshow Bob's!
   -- Communists need not apply, ``''
   
 Bart digs a hole in the backyard and carries on a conversation with the
 head.  The head suggests that a hero can be a young boy who admits his
 mistake.  Bart tosses the head into the hole. ``Yeah, well, I'm a little
 short on courage right now.''  The head asks Bart to think about it.

 The rest of the family watch a documentary.

   We've recently uncovered evidence that the bear, in fact, probably
   killed &lt;him&gt;.
   -- ``''
   
 Bart appears, with the head.  Homer approaches Bart menacingly.  ``Why?
 You little...''  Bart explains, ``Somehow I got the idea that being
 popular was the most important thing in the world.'' Homer reacts.
 Marge asks, ``Where did you get a ridiculous idea like that!?''  Homer
 nervously asks Marge to take it easy on the boy.  Marge concludes that
 that Homer was more than a little responsible.  Homer leaves with Bart
 to return the ``head thing'' to the authorities.

 At night, Bart and Homer walk down the streets of downtown Springfield.
 Bart carries the head of a statue.  Homer reassures Bart, ``You know, Bart,
 when I was your age, I pulled a few boners.  But I think you'll find that
 people are pretty decent if you give them half a---''  They turn the
 corner and find an angry, torch-wielding mob.   Running out of places
 to run, Homer and Bart run onto the town square...

 Various mob voices exclaim, ``All right!''  ``We know this part!''

 Dissolve back to the present.  Bart concludes, ``If you still want to tear
 apart this young Sunday School student as he stands on the brink of
 salvation, I await your wrath.  But I'd like to add one thing.  It wasn't
 until after I'd removed the head that we realized we were taking our
 heritage for granted.  That's a crime, too.  One I think we are all guilty
 of.''  The crowd is won over.  Says Krusty, ``Somehow, I don't feel like
 killing any more.''  Neither does Ms. Krabappel.

 Homer tosses Bart the head, and with a quiet ``Forgive me, sir'', Bart
 replaces it.  The head replies, ``No problem, Bart.''  All are touched.
   
   Burns:    [overcome with emotion]  I love you, Smithers.
   Smithers: The feeling is more than mutual, sir.
   -- ``''
   
 Church bells peal, and there was much rejoicing.

 EPISODE TITLE: Life on the Fast Lane


EPISODE SUMMARY: 

   

 The Simpsons' kitchen is a disaster area, due no doubt to Bart and
 Lisa's well-intentioned attempt at cooking.
   
   Lisa: This is going to be the best birthday breakfast Mom ever had!
   Bart: [looking to plate of 42 pancakes]  Hey Lis, you think that's enough
         for her?
   Lisa: Maybe one more.
   -- ``Jacques to be Wild''
   
 Lisa removes a cake from the microwave.
   
   Lisa: I hope she likes the presents we got her.
   Bart: [produces a 10-litre jug labelled `French Perfume' (in English)]
         Well, I know she'll like mine.  Who wouldn't like a bottle of real
         French perfume?  All the way from gay Pari!  Foooouuur bucks (plus tax).
   -- ``Jacques to be Wild''
   
 Bart is not impressed by Lisa's hand-made birthday card---until he
 sees it.  Lisa mixes the icing for the cake, and Bart makes dips
 on licking the beater.
   
   Bart: I get to lick the beaters!
   Lisa: [hands him the electric mixer]
   Bart: Whago, agh agh aghh!  Weetha!  Mugh humgb ipht paht im dapt beiter,
         Mugh humgb!
   -- ``Jacques to be Wild''
   
 The kids tip-toe into the bedroom carrying a breakfast tray,
 starring a monumental stack of pancakes.
   
   Bart+Lisa: HAP-PY BIRTH-DAY!
   Homer: [alarmed]  Aaggh!  Whaa... What!
   Lisa:  Here's your birthday breakfast!
   Marge: [delighted]  Ooh!  Well isn't this nice!
   Homer: My birthday?
   Lisa:  No!
   Homer: It's my birthday!  What did I get?  I &lt;love&gt; birthdays!
   Marge: [angrily]  No Homer, it's mine!
   Bart:  You don't even know your own wife's birthday?
   Homer: Well, of, ... of course I know!  Sure!  [nudges Marge with his elbow]
          You really thought I'd forgot, didn't you?  [gets out of bed]
   Bart:  Oh, right.  What did you get her Dad?
   Lisa:  Yeah, whadja get?
   Homer: [getting dressed]  A very... thoughtful gift... But it's a surprise!
          [stretches his arms]  You know it's such a beautiful morning, I think
          I'll take a little stroll around the block.  [leaves the room.
          We hear the pit-pat of feet accelerating down the stairs and into the
          car, followed by the squeal of car tyres.]
   -- ``Jacques to be Wild''
   
 Notes Lisa, ``I think he forgot, Mom.''

 Homer speeds his car into the parking lot of the Springfield Mall,
 to find that the mall has not yet opened for trading.  Fortunately,
 the wait for the mall to open is brief.  Walking through the mall,
 Homer rejects each of the shops he passes.

Homer hurries in underneath the security door.  He passes by the International
House of Answering Machines (``Ahh, No.''),  The Jerky Hut (``Too salty!''),
The Ear Piercery (``Umm, Naah!''),  The Carmel [sic] Corn Warehouse (``Naah,
too Corny''),  and past Girdles N' Such -- Fancy Lingerie (``Too exciting!'').

When Homer returns from the mall, he is whistling, ``In the Hall of
the Mountain King'' from ``Peer Gynt'' by Grieg.


 Marge is on the phone to her sisters.
   
   Marge: Patty, he's out buying me something right now.
   Patty: Oh Marge, he never gets you anything &lt;you&gt; want.  He always gets
          something for himself.
   Selma: [mumbles]  The tackle box...
   Patty: Remember when he got you the tackle box?
   Selma: [mumbles]  ... and the Chung calendar.
   Patty: And when he `surprised' you with the Connie Chung calendar?
   -- ``Jacques to be Wild''
   
 Marge answers, ``I'm sure he doesn't do it deliberately.''

 At a sporting supplies store, Homer inspects a green bowling ball.

 Patty offers to take Marge someplace fun to celebrate:  The Singing
 Sirloin.  Marge isn't so sure she wants to go to a restaurant where
 the waiters sing.

 Homer lugs a gift-wrapped present into the house and stashes it in
 the closet.  The perfect crime.  Marge tells Homer they're having
 dinner at the Singing Sirloin.  Homer likes the idea---until he
 learns that Marge's sisters will also be there.

That night at the Singing Sirloin,  Mr &amp; Mrs Winfield celebrate their
wedding anniversary (``..oh we danced, on the night, we were wed...''), a
young man proposes to his very pregnant girlfriend (``..baby, what a lovely
way to say how much I love you...''), and a funeral party [pun unavoidable]
sit through ``nearer my God to thee''.

The singers sing, ``Happy 34th Birthday''

 At the Simpsons' table at the Singing Sirloin, Marge opens her
 presents.  She is overwhelmed by the scent from Bart's jug of perfume.
 Meanwhile, the Bouvier twins quietly comment on how thirty-four
 years old is ``Time enough to start over with a new man.''
   
   Lisa:  I think she likes my present better.
   \&lt;
   Bart:  Does not!
   Lisa:           |Does too!
   Bart:           |         |Does not!
   Lisa:           |         |         |Does too!
   Bart:           |         |         |         |Does not!
   \&gt;
   Lisa:  Then how come she's not putting on any of your perfume?
   Bart:  [worried]  Yeah...  Hey Mom, how come you're not putting on any of my
          perfume?
   Marge: [diplomatically]  Well I'm saving it... for a special occasion.
   Bart:  What the hell are you talking about?  There's gallons of it!
   Homer: [barks] Bart!
   Marge: [eyes darting]  But this occasion is already so special,
          if we make it any &lt;more&gt; special, we might end up making it
          &lt;less&gt; special.
   Bart:  Gotcha!  [to Lisa]  I told you she liked mine better.
   Lisa:  Oh, brother.
   -- ``Jacques to be Wild''
   
 Homer calls the waiters to the table, who sing ``Happy 34th
 birthday, Mrs. Homer Simpson.''  Homer hands over his gift, but the
 bottom of the box falls out, depositing a green bowling ball
 (engraved ``Homer'') atop the birthday cake.  All are shocked
 speechless.
   
   Homer: Don't worry, this frosting will come right off. [looking to the ball]
          Beauty, isn't she?
   Marge: Well it's hard for me to judge, SINCE I'VE NEVER BOWLED IN MY LIFE!
   Homer: Well if you don't want it, I know someone how does...
   -- ``Jacques to be Wild''
   
 Marge blows out the surviving candle on her cake with a huff.

 [End of Act One]

 That evening in bed, Homer tries to defend his gift selection to
 Marge, who has clearly seen through his ruse.  To Homer's surprise,
 Marge accepts the gift and thanks him.

 Marge enters Barney's (new) Bowl-a-rama, carrying her birthday
 present.
   
   Marge:     Excuse me, where do I throw this?
   Attendant: Over there.
   Marge:     Thank you.  [heads off]
   Attendant: Hey---wait a minute!  You're going need a lane!
   Marge:     No thanks, I'm just here out of spite.
   Attendant: [pointing to sign reading...]  Can't bowl without a lane.
   Marge:     Well, all right.
   Attendant: [hands her a scoresheet]  Here you go... you keep score on this.
              What sized shoes you wear?
   Marge:     Never you mind!
   Attendant: [pointing to another sign]  Can't wear street shows on the lane.
              You gotta wear bowling shoes.  What size please?
   Marge:     [grudgingly]  Hmhmm... Thirteen double A.
   Attendant: Thirteen double A!!!  [whistles in amazement]  The closest I've
              got is a nine and a fifteen.
   -- ``Jacques to be Wild''
   
 Marge takes her lane, puts on her bowling shoes...
   
   They're a little warm and moist.
   -- Marge puts on (rented) bowling shoes, ``Jacques to be Wild''
   
 ... steps up to the toe line, gets the basic idea, then hurtles the
 bowling ball down the lane (thump-thump-thump), knocking over the
 seven pin.  In the next land, a male bowler bowls a strike and
 collects a wager, to the cheers of adoring women.  He then spots
 Marge.  Marge gives the bowling ball another heave, and she knocks
 over the seven pin---in the next lane.
   
   Marge:  I'm awfully sorry!
   Bowler: Entirely my fault.  It's nice to meet you...
           [looks at her bowling ball]  Homer.
   Marge:  No no.  Homer is my... ball's name.
   -- ``Jacques to be Wild''
   
 Marge fills in her scoresheet.  The man approaches.  As he talks to
 her, we see him caressing her hand in the overhead projector.
   
   Bowler:  Your fingers are so slender, so feminine.  They're far too tapered
            for the ball you are using.  You need something lighter, more
            delicate.  Here, use my ball.
   Marge:   No, no thank you Mister... [looking at his bowling ball] Brunswick.
   -- ``Jacques to be Wild''
   
 Marge declines Jacques' offer.
   
   Many people have senseless attachments to heavy clumsy things such as
   this Homer of yours.
   -- Jacques, ``Jacques to be Wild''
   
 Jacques offers to give Marge bowling lessons, and Marge agrees after
 some prodding.  He asks her to throw the ball, and she does.  Again,
 she knocks over only the seven pin.  ``I can hit that one pin all
 right, but the rest of them don't even wobble.''  Jacques moves
 Marge to his lane and instructs her to ``Throw, damn you!''  She
 does.  A strike!
   
   Marge:   You're a very good teacher!
   Jacques: Yes I am a very good teacher and I can teach you everything.  I can
            tell you what the little arrows on the wood floor mean.  Which frame
            is the beer frame.
   -- ``Jacques to be Wild''
   
 Jacques then tells a leetle joke and is enchanted by Marge's
 laughter.
   
   Marge:   What do you charge for lessons?
   Jacques: Twenty-five dollars.
   Marge:   [shocked]  Twenty five dollars!
   Jacques: [leaning forward]  A forty-dollars value!
   -- ``Jacques to be Wild''
   
 Marge agrees.  ``When do we start?''  Jacques takes her hand. ``We
 have already begun.''

 At home, Homer serves dinner.
   
   Hot pizza, the food of kings!
   -- Homer serves dinner, ``Jacques to be Wild''
   
 Homer looks forward to spending more time with the kids.  They eat
 in silence.  ``Does the time always drag like this?''

 Jacques introduces Marge to the bowling lane, up close and personal.
   
   Jacques: First, you must get to know your lane.  Feel the slickness, feel the
            slippery finish. Caresses it, experience it. Quite smooth, isn't it?
   Marge:   Oh, very smooth.
   \&lt;
   Jacques: Smooth?
   Marge:          |Yes, very.
   Jacques:        |          |Yes?
   Marge:          |          |    |Yes.
   Jacques:        |          |    |    |Yes.
   Marge:          |          |    |    |    |Smooth.
   Jacques:        |          |    |    |    |       |Smooth.
   Marge:          |          |    |    |    |       |       |Yes.
   Jacques:        |          |    |    |    |       |       |    |Yes.
    :        You could eat off of it.
   \&gt;
   Marge:   Hmmmm...
   Jacques: You hungry?
   Marge:   Yes.
    Jacques: [yelling]  Four Onion rings!
   
   Back at the house,
   
    Lisa:  [finishing her pizza]  Hummm!  Deliciouso!
    Bart:  My compliments to the delivery boy.
    Homer: Ok, we've eaten and eaten well.  Now what else do we have to do?
           Well, let's check the list your Mom left us...  Eat, huhmmmm,
           [ticks with a pencil]  Oh, clean up!  Now don't worry everybody, this
           will be a breeze if we all pitch in.  [they form a human chain to the
           bin]  Allright!  We're clean!  Now we'll... [looks to Maggie]
           Put Maggie to bed.
   
   In Maggie's bedroom.  Homer, Bart and Lisa stand beside Maggie's cot.
   
    Homer,Bart and Lisa:
           Lullaby, and goodnight,
           come to bed and sleep tight.
           Close your eyes, start to yawn.
           Pleasant dreams until the dawn.
   
   Homer is exhausted.  Later that night Marge enters the bedroom dressed in her
   sleeping gown.
   
    Marge: Homer, Homer?
    Homer: Huh?  Wah?  Oh,  How was bowling?
    Marge: It's a very challenging hobby.
    Homer: Heh heh,  It's a sport dear.  It's a sport you silly thing.
    Marge: But I think I'll do much better tomorrow night.
    Homer: [shocked/surprised]  Oh!  You're going back?
    Marge: Oh sure, if you don't mind taking care of the kids again.
    Homer: [confused]  Oh, no,  I don't mind.
   
   They say goodnight to each other.  At Marge's next bowling lesson, Jacques
   gives her a bowling glove.
   
    Marge:   Jacques!  It fits, you got it in my size and it has my name on it.
             It's really for me!
    Jacques: [thrusts himself upon her]  Seventeen fifty, enjoy it my darling.
   
   Marge bowls and leaves only a single pin standing, then looks to Jacques
   pleased with her improvement.  Jacques massages her hands over a steam vent,
   and they look into each others' eyes.  He fits Marge out with a new pair of
   bowling shoes (nb: four toes), teaches her to hold a ball correctly, assists
   marking the scoresheet, helps her to dip a onion ring, more gazing into each
   others' eyes, the final bowling pin topples...
   
   Jacques gives Marge a lift home.
   
    Marge:   You didn't have to drop me off.
    Jacques: But I wanted to. [grasps her hand]  Marge, do you know how beautiful
             you look in the moonlight?
    Marge:   Errrr, Jacques!  I'm a married woman!
    Jacques: I know, I know.  My mind says stop, but my heart, and my hips, cry
             proceed.  [Marge reacts accordingly]  Marge darling, I - I want to
             see you tomorrow.  Not at Barney's Bowlorama, away from the
             thunderous folly of clattering pins.  Meet me tomorrow for Brunch.
    Marge:   What's Brunch?
    Jacques: You'd love it,  It's not quite breakfast, it's not quite lunch, but
             it comes with a slice of cantaloupe at the end.  You don't get
             completely what you would at breakfast, but you get a good meal!
    Marge:   I don't think so.
    Jacques: Marge, darling.  There are ten pins in my heart, you've knocked
             over eight.  Won't you please pick up that spare?
    Marge:   [hesitantly]  Mmmm, mmmmm... All right!
   
   Marge returns to bed.  Homer feels something has changed between them, but
   isn't able to express it.  They fall asleep isolated from each other.
   
   The next morning,  Otto pulls up in front of the house.
   
    Bart:  O-ho!  School bus!
    Marge: [holding two grocery bags full of goodies]  Here you go kids,
           Special lunches!  Lots of good things for growing bodies, [Bart and
           Lisa look to each other bewildered]  and some treats just for fun.
    Bart:  Aye Carumba!
    Lisa:  Are you going bowling again tonight Mom?
    Marge: Yes I am, as a matter of fact.  [tops up their lunches, to Bart's
           delight, but Lisa is worried]  Here's more treats.  But don't worry,
           your Dad will take care of dinner.
    Bart:  [delighted]  Hmmm, Wednesday.  Hoagie night!
    Marge: [kisses Lisa]  Goodbye Lisa, my darling little Lisa.
           [kisses Bart]  Goodbye Bart, my special little guy.
   
   Bart and Lisa are sitting next to each other on the bus.  Bart has already
   started lunch.
   
    Bart: Hmm, Great lunches, hey Lis?
    Lisa: Oh Bart, don't you see?  This is what psychologists call Over-
          compensation,  Mom is racked with guilt because their marriage is
          failing.
    Bart: Hey, don't rock the boat Man.  Whatever it is, we're making out like
          bandits.
    Lisa: Bart, I've read about what happens to kids who's parents no longer
          love and cherish each other.  They go through eight separate stages.
          Right now I'm in stage three, Fear.  You're in stage two, Denial.
    Bart: [whines]  No I'm not.
    Lisa: Yes you are.
    Bart: [angrily]  No I'm not!
    Lisa: Yes you are!
    Bart: Am not!  Am not!  Am not!
    Lisa: I stand corrected,
   
   Jacques inspects the brunch menu at a Cajun restaurant, while Marge nervously
   wrings a napkin in her hands.
   
    Jacques: Mimosa?
    Marge:   I'm a married woman, please don't call me that.
    Jacques: [laughs]  Nononono.  Mimosa is the name of the drink.  It's orange
             juice and champagne.  [laughs]  You're so wonderful that you thought
             it was something offensive.
    Marge:   [accepting the compliment]  Oooo, well thank you.
   
   Helen Lovejoy, the gossipy wife of the Minister recognizes Marge (who tries to
   hide behind a menu.)
   
    Helen:   [at 78rpm]  I had just finished eating and was about to leave, when
             I looked over this way and said to myself, Huh!  Isn't that Marge
             Simpson over there, having brunch with a man who isn't her husband?
             [Jacques is annoyed, Marge forces a smile].  Ha ha, and I just had
             to come over and say Hello!
    Marge:   We're..  um..
    Helen:   Oh, don't squirm on my account.
    Jacques: I am giving her a bowling lesson, thank you.  Now Marge, [using the
             salt shakers]  The pins on the 3-7-10 split would be here.  We'll
             make this little piece of food here the ball, the ball's bigger, you
             know that. [Helen suspects something]  but for food, this is a good
             ball.
    Helen:   Ahem, well, byebye. [to Marge]  See you in church on Sunday, Marge.
    Marge:   [cheerlessly]  Good-bye Helen.
    Jacques: Goodbye Helen.  You have a lovely friend there, [Marge "Hmmm's"
             unhappily]  Let's hope something runs over her.  [Marge sniggers]
             Your laughter is like music to me, but if you laugh at what I say
             next, I will die.  For I am about to say something very serious,
             perhaps shocking.  Marge my darling, I want you to meet with me,
             again.
    Marge:   That doesn't shock me.
    Jacques: [reaching across the table]  Away from prying eyes, away from the
             Helen's of the world.  At my apartment, the Fiesta Terrace.
   
   Marge faints.
   
   She dreams, (with a definite bowling motif and a light grey and pink scheme.)
   Dressed in a apricot ballroom gown, she rings a doorbell and Jacques (dressed
   in a tuxedo) answers the door.  (``I've been waiting for you.  Come in my
   captivating one.'')  Curtains rise revealing the interior to his (lavishly
   furnished) apartment.  The two of them dance, and during a (whatever they call
   that dance movement) Marge notices a trophy case filled with awards.
   
    Marge:   You certainly have a lot of bowling trophies.
    Jacques: Ha ha, [whispered]  I like you so much.  They're not for bowling
             Marge.  You're so naive,  They're for lovemaking!
    Marge:   Really?
   
   After a most stylish sequence of them dancing together, Marge rests at a
   cocktail bar and Jacques offers her a Champagne.  They sip with their arms
   entwined, then toss the glasses over their shoulders and resume dancing.
   
    Jacques: What cosmic force brought us together Marge?
    Marge:   Destiny!
    Jacques: Yes.  Some divine pin-spotter, must have placed us, side-by-side.
    Marge:   Like two fragile bowling pins.
    Jacques: Standing bravely.
    Marge:   Until inevitably,
    Jacques: We must topple.
   
   Marge's fantasy concludes.  Jacques is trying to revive her has she lies on
   the restaurant floor.
   
    Jacques: Marge!  Marge!  Speak to me!
    Marge:   Is Thursday ok?
    Jacques: It's ok indeed.
   
   Homer changes from his shirt in the bedroom and notices a photograph on the
   dressing table of him and Marge together.  He discovers the bowling glove in
   the dresser (``For... Marge?''), and sadly realizes that Marge must be seeing
   someone else.  He places the glove back in drawer and sits cheerlessly on the
   end of the bed.  Bart trots in with a baseball glove.
   
    Bart:  Hey Dad!  Whatawe say we toss the old apple around, huh?  Sound like
           fun?
    Homer: Son, I don't know if I can lift my head, let alone a ball.
    Bart:  Come on Dad, get the lead out.
   
   Bart drags Homer out of the bedroom by the arm.  Homer stands listlessly at
   the far end of the backyard wearing a baseball glove.
   
    Bart:  [practicing his baseball]  Simpson checks the runner on first, he's
           cool(?) on sign.  Here's the windup,  and Heerree's the pitch,
           [beaning Homer on the forehead.  Homer slumps to the ground and
           Bart runs to him]  Dad, you didn't even say `Ouch!'
    Homer: Oh...  Sorry...  Ouch.
   
   Worried, Bart runs to Lisa (sitting underneath the porch light with Maggie).
   
    Bart: Lisa, Lisa, I think you're right about Dad.  There's something very
          very wrong here.
    Lisa: Bart, welcome to stage three, Fear.
    Bart: [urgently]  Well come on!  We've got to do something man!
    Lisa: Sorry Bart, I would love to help you but I am mired in stage five,
          Self-pity.
   
   Bart runs back to Homer.
   
    Bart:  Look Dad, I don't know what's going on, but once you gave me some
           advice that might help.
    Homer: I gave you advice?  Get outta here.
    Bart:  Yeah, you did.  You told me when something's bothering you, and you're
           too damn stupid to know what to do, just keep your fool mouth shut.
           At least that way you won't make things worse.
    Homer: Hmmm, good advice.
   
   Marge is in the kitchen making sandwiches.  Homer enters and almost reaches
   for his wife's hand, but pauses to pick up his lunch box instead.  As he is
   about to leave through the back door, he turns around and looks to Marge.
   
    Homer: Marge, may I.. speak to you?
    Marge: Sure.
    Homer: You know, I've been thinking.  Everyone makes peanut butter and jelly
           sandwiches, but usually the jelly drips out over the sides and the
           guy's hands get all sticky.  But your jelly stays right in the middle
           where it's supposed to.  I don't know how you do it.  You've just got
           a gift I guess, and I've always thought so,  I've just never
           mentioned it.  But it's time you knew how I feel.  I don't believe in
           keeping feelings bottled up.  [pause]  Goodbye my wife.
    Marge: ...Goodbye Homer.
   
   In his apartment at the Fiesta Terrace, Jacques prepares himself in front of
   the bathroom mirror.
   
    Jacques: To the most beautiful moment in life,  Better than a deed, better
             than a memory, the moment... of anticipation!
   
    Jacques: Oh Jacques, you handsome devil.  Look at you,  You're really going
             to  STRIKE OUT TONIGHT!
   
   The SNPP during lunch-time.  Homer sits staring forlornly at his sandwich.
   
    Lenny: Ain't you hungry Homer?
    Homer: Starving.
    Lenny: Then why aren't you eating your sandwich?
    Homer: How can I eat it?  She made it,  It's all I have left.
   
   Homer packs up his sandwich and walks away.  The technician recognizes a
   ``Domestic Situation''.
   
   Marge is driving through Springfield on her way to see Jacques.  Stopping at
   the traffic lights she sees a wedding, and averts her eyes to the other
   direction only to see a young couple wheeling a pram.  The lights turn green
   and she speeds off.  At the next stop sign Marge uneasily watches a family at
   a picnic, and the elderly couple walking down the path at the next stop drives
   the point further, with the help of two gravestones side-by-side and two
   skeletons (costumes) holding hands.
   
   At the turnoff to the SNPP and the Fiesta Terrace, Marge initially heads
   towards the Fiesta, but skids to a halt and reverses to the SNPP.  She returns
   to the intersection and sits staring at the turnoff sign.

   Marge enters the Power plant, to the surprise of all the workers clad in their
   radiation suits.  She marches down the main corridor, attracting the attention
   of everyone including Mr Burns.  Her silhouette passes a doorway, and finds
   Homer working unhappily at a waste separator.
   
    [Taps him on the shoulder]
    Homer: Marge!  What a lovely surprise!  You're hear to see me, right?
    Marge: Of course!  [cuddles and kisses him on the cheek]
   
   Homer picks her up and carries her past his cheering co-workers.  (``Way to go
   Homer, Way to Go!'')
   
    Worker: Hey, what will I tell the boss?
    Homer:  Tell him I'm going to the back seat of my car, with the woman I love,
            and I won't be back for ten minutes!
   
   Continued applause and cheering from the other employees.  Marge wears Homer's
   Safety helmet as he carries her outside into the sunset.

 EPISODE TITLE: Homer's Night Out


EPISODE SUMMARY: 



 Morning bathroom routine.  As Marge brushes her teeth, she asks about
 the office party Homer attended last night.

   Marge: So how was the office birthday party?
   Homer: Oh, it was de-lightful!  The frosting on the cake was this thick!
          [about an inch]  And Eugene Fisk (my poor sucker of an assistant)
          didn't know the fruit punch was spiked, and he really made an ass of
          himself putting the moves on a new girl in valve maintenance.
          Ha ha ha..
   Marge: Does this girl like him?
   Homer: Pffft.  I have to warn you Marge, I think the poor young thing has the
          hots for Yours Truly!
   Marge: Homer!
   Homer: Just keepin' you on your toes, babe.
   -- ``''

 Homer steps onto the bathroom scales...

   AAGGGHHH!  TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY NINE POUNDS!!!   Ohh, I'm a blimp.
   Why are the good things so tasty?
   -- Homer weighs himself, ``''

 Homer vows to do exercises every morning.  Marge gives him a hug.
 ``You're not a blimp Homer, you're myyy big cuddwy teddy-bear!''

 Bart sifts through the advertisements in his comic book, is impressed
 by a spy camera advert (``Just like the CIA uses!''), smashes his
 piggy-bank, and mails the coupon.

 Six months later, Homer steps up once again onto the bathroom scale...

   Oh no!  Two hundred and thirty nine pounds!  I'm a whale!
   Why was I cursed with this weakness for snack treats?
   -- Homer weighs himself, ``''

   Homer: Well, from now on, exercise every morning Homer!  [does
          stretching exercises in front of the bathroom mirror]
   Marge: Ooh, don't strain yourself, dear.
   Homer: Good idea Marge.  [stops]
   -- ``''

 Homer mentions that Friday night he'll be attending ``a little get-together
 with the boys at work.  Eugene Fisk is marrying some girl in valve
 maintenance.''  Marge suspects that this is a stag party, but Homer insists
 that it will be a ``tea-and-crumpets kind of thing.''

   Marge: Mmmhmmm.  Eugene Fisk, isn't he your assistant?
   Homer: No!  My... supervisor.
   Marge: Didn't he used to be your assistant?
   Homer: Hey, what is this!  The Spanish Exposition?
   Marge: Sorry, Homer...
   -- ``''

 Bart and Lisa sit on the couch.  Lisa, as usual, has her face in a
 book, Bart is watching TV.

   Bart: [doorbell rings] Oh-ho!  It's the fe-mail-man!
   Lisa: Fe-mail-carrier, Bart.
   -- ``''

 Bart runs to the front door.

  
    :  Bart                           | The Fe-mail-man
    : Lady, where's my spy camera.    |
    : Where's my spy camera?          |Where's my spy camera.
    : Where's my spy camera, lady?    |Every day for the last six months,
    : Where is my spy camera?         |``Where is my spy camera?''
    : Where's my spy camera?!         |``Where's my spy camera?!''
    : &lt;Where's my spy camera!&gt;        |``&lt;Where's my spy camera!&gt;''
    :                                 |Here's your stupid spy camera!!
    :                                 |[thrusts a parcel at Bart]
    : Whoa, thanks, man!
   -- ``''

 Bart accepts the package the slams the door in the fe-mail-carrier's face.
 He unwraps the camera and wonders if it really works, 'cause he's got a lot
 of spying to do...

 Bart finds Homer doing touching-toes exercises in the bathroom, and from
 Homer's ascending and descending POV, he watches Bart take a photo (mostly of
 his stomach).

   Bart:  [snaps Homer's picture]
   Homer: Bart!  Whaddaya doing!
   Bart:  Sorry Dad, the answer to that is top secret.
   -- ``''

 Bart photographs Marge shaving her armpits.  So tells him to take wildlife
 pictures.  So Bart takes a picture of a squirrel pancake, complete with
 fresh tire tracks.  Lisa finds Bart in his bedroom with his pants down...

   Lisa: Ewwww, gross.  Momm!  Bart was taking a picture of his butt!
   Bart: [hastily pulls up his pants]
         Oh sure, like I'm really gonna take a picture of my butt.
   -- ``''

 Marge tells the kids to put on some nice clothes.  ``Since it's just
 the four of us tonight, we're having dinner at the Rusty Barnacle.''
 Lisa looks forward to fried shrimp.  Bart asks, ``Only four of us?
 Who escaped?''  Marge explains that Homer is having a boys' night out.

 At the stag party, Homer and a dozen or so other men sit around a table in a
 smoke-filled room, beer in hand, as the father of the groom-to-be tells a
 touching story of his son.  Homer grouses, ``Where am I?  The planet
 corn-ball?''  Carl tells him things will pick up once the entertainment
 arrives.

 Marge and the kids are seated in the main dining area of the restaurant.
 Lisa wears a origami hat.  The waiter (dressed as a sea-pirate) asks for
 their orders.

   Waiter: Ahoy!  I spy the children's menu!
   Bart:   Ahoy!  This place bites!
   Marge:  Bart!
   -- A visit to the Rusty Barnacle, ``''

   Waiter: So what's it going to be, me little buck-o?
   Bart:   A-huh-ha-hmm, let's see... [examines the menu]  This evening I shall
           go for the...  Squid platter...
   Lisa:   [disgusted]  Ewwwww!
   Bart:   ... with extra tentacles, please.
   -- A visit to the Rusty Barnacle, ``''

 Marge asks the waiter do to something about the raucous party next door.
 While Bart fills out a survey form, the waiter tells the men in ``Davy
 Jones' Locker'' to keep it down.  Homer tells him to shut up.
 Everyone apart from Fisks Sr. and Jr. are enjoying themselves, mostly due to
 the effects of alcohol.

 Bart amuses himself by anagramming ``Cod Platter'' into ``Cold Pet Rat''
 on the daily menu.  The waiter returns with their meals.

   Waiter: [fried shrimp for Lisa]  Here you go...                     \\
           [pork chop \'a la // Hawaiian]  There you are...            \\
           [a smaller serving of fried shrimp]  For the baby...        \\
           [to Bart]  And one squid platter, &lt;extra&gt; tentacles.
   Bart:   Heh heh... Urrggghh... [turns green and drops below the table]
   Marge:  Bart, quit fooling around and eat your dinner!
   Lisa:   [taunting]  Yeah, eat it Bart.
   Bart:   [from beneath the table] May I please be excused for a minute?
   Marge:  Well okay, but don't dawdle.  Your food will get cold.
   Bart:   Urgh.  [leaves the table]
   -- A visit to the Rusty Barnacle, ``''

 Maggie removes her pacifier and replace it with piece of shrimp.  She
 sucks on it.

 At the stag party, the entertainment, a belly-dancer, enters the room to
 give Eugene one last taste of bachelor freedom.  His co-workers clear the
 floor and present to him Princess Kashmir, Queen of the Mysterious East.
 All the men go wild, apart from Eugene and his father, and Homer, who is
 preoccupied with eating a hoagie.  Eugene and his dad are clearly not
 enjoying the ordeal.

 Kashmir has no success enticing Eugene, so Homer is invited to dance with
 her and is pushed up onto the table. (``Go for it Homer!'')

 Bart emerges from the Buoys room, hears the hubbub, and pokes his head
 in the door.  He spots Homer tucking money into Princess Kashmir's
 G-string.  He saves the moment forever with his miniature spy camera.
 Homer proudly announces, ``This is the most fun I've ever had in my life!''

 [End of Act One.  Time: 6:31]

 Martin inaugurates Bart into the Future Photographers of America, held in a
 red-lit darkroom.  Bart dispenses with the preliminaries and gets to work.

   Martin: My goodness!  Quite exciting!
   Girl:   Extremely sensual.
   Boy:    The subtle greytones recall the work of Helmut Newton...
   Martin: Who's the sexy lady, Bart?
   Bart:   [hanging up the photo to dry]  Beats me, but the guy dancing with her
           s'my Pop.
   All:    Wow!
   Boy:    [making a closer inspection of the photo]  He brings to mind the
           later work of Diane Arbus.
   -- ``''

 Bart denies requests for a copy, and the kids leave annoyed and
 disappointed.

   Milhouse: Come on Bart.  You're gonna make me a print aren't you?
   Bart:     Will you swear not to let another living soul get a copy of this
             photo?
   Milhouse: Ok.
   Bart:     Cross your heart and hope to die?
   Milhouse: Yup.
   Bart:     Stick a needle in your eye?
   Milhouse: Yup.
   Bart:     Jam a dagger in your thigh?
   Milhouse: Yup.
   Bart:     Eat a horse-manure pie?
   Milhouse: [gulps]  Yup.
   Bart:     Well, okay.
   -- ``''

 Milhouse flaunts his copy of the photo to a kid in the library, and is
 persuaded without too much effort to make a trip to the photocopier. Lewis
 asks Bart why Milhouse gets a copy of his girlie picture but he doesn't.
 Before too long the photo has made its way throughout the entire school.

 The father of one of the kids confiscates the photo, and faxes it to one of
 his work-mates.  Rev. Lovejoy is shown the picture of Homer and the exotic
 dancer which was confiscated one of the boys in the choir. (``This one has
 strayed from my own flock.'')  At SNPP...

   Burns:    His name?
   Smithers: [holding a copy of the incriminating photo]
             Homer Simpson sir, a low-level employee in sector 7G.
   Burns:    Simpson, eh?
   -- ``''

 Burns asks to see ``our self-styled Valentino'' tomorrow morning.

 At an aerobics studio, a group of women chuckle at the now-popular photo,
 with the legend ``Watch Out!!!  Bathing suit season is coming,'' and an
 arrow points to Homer's gut.  Marge rips the photo from the board.

 Homer drops by the Kwik-E-Mart, to buy a donut and a Scratch-and-Winticket.
 A copy of Bart's photo is pinned to the wall behind Apu.

   Apu:   You look familiar, sir.  Are you on the television or something?
   Homer: Sorry buddy, you've got me confused with Fred Flintstone.
   -- ``''

 Homer scratches the ticket, but his dreams of being a millionaire are foiled
 by that purple fruit thing.  A man greets Homer, but Homer doesn't get it.
 A boy sings ``Do-do Do Do Do, Do-dee Do-dee Do-dee Do'' to the tune of
 the `Arabian Snake Charmer', and Homer answers, ``Well a Do-dee Do Do to
 you too, pintsized.''  Another fellow greets Homer as he leaves the
 convenience store.  (``Wheew, Full moon''), and at the traffic light
 he is recognized by some young women in a sports car (``Huhmm, still
 got it'').  He arrives home and opens the front door...

   Marge: [thrusting a copy of the photograph in his face]
          What is the &lt;meaning&gt; of this!
   Homer: Whyarreeuumpht...  Meaningless!  Marge...  Don't even attempt to find
          meaning in it.  There's nothing between me and Princess Kashmir!
   Marge: Princess &lt;who&gt;?
   Bart:  [wanders by] Hey, my photo!
   Homer+Marge:  &lt;Your photo!&gt;
   Bart:  Uh-oh.
   Homer: Why you little...  [steps towards Bart]
   Marge: [grabs Homer's neck] Why you big...
          Bart!  Go to your room!
   Bart:  I'm outta here...
   -- ``''

   Homer: Look, Marge... Honey... Baby... Doll...
   Marge: [turning her back, folding her arms]  Homer, I don't even want to look
          at you right now.
   Homer: What are you saying, honey?  [Marge points him outside]  But where will
          I sleep?
   Marge: [shaking angrily] My suggestion is you sleep in the filth you created!
   Homer: Will a motel be okay? [Marge slams the front door in his face]
   -- Shall I take that as a yes?  ``''

 Homer heads dejectedly for the car.  The door opens, and Homer is relieved
 that Marge is taking him back.  He is greeted in the face with a half-packed
 suitcase of clothes.  Marge hands him a box of tissues.  ``If you have any
 soul left, you'll need these.  I know I will.''  Homer sits sadly on the
 front lawn.

 [End of Act Two.  Time: 10:54]

 Moe's Tavern.  ``LADIES NIGHT.  Unescorted ladies drink free.''  A single,
 very tired looking lady sits at the bar.

   Moe:   Whatsamatta, Homer?  It's the hottest ladies night in months and you're
          not even checking out the action.
   Homer: Oh Moe, my wife gave me the ol' heave-ho because of some lousy picture.
   Moe:   [pointing to a copy behind him]  What, this one?
   Homer: D'oh!
   -- ``''

 When Homer says he'll spend the night in a motel, Barney insists, ``No pal
 of mine is going to stay in some dingy flop house!''

 The two of them return to Barney's dingy flop-house.  Strewn everywhere is
 clear evidence that Barney is still a bachelor.

   If you get hungry in the middle of the night, there's a open beer in
   the fridge.
   -- Barney Gumbel, your gracious host, ``''

 Homer goes to the window.

   Homer:  Look Barney, see the row of tiny lights up there?  The middle one is
           my house.  Someone must've left the porch light on.
   Barney: Hey, that's rough pal. [using the phone]  Hello, Marge?  You left
           your damned porch light on!  Homer isn't made of money you know!
   -- ``''

 Marge quickly hangs up when she hears Homer's protesting voice.
 Barney suggests that Homer is overwrought and needs to unwind.

   There's a party down the hall.  You know this apartment complex
   really caters to up-scale singles like me.  [belch]
   -- Barney Gumbel, your gracious host, ``''

 Homer declines the offer and spends an uncomfortable night on a
 fold-out couch, while the party down the hall rocks on.

 The next morning Marge and the kids sit at the kitchen table, silently
 eating breakfast.  Lisa whispers to Bart, ``I wonder when Dad's coming
 home?''  Marge stares sadly.

 At work, an exhausted Homer drinks straight from the coffeepot.  The PA
 system orders him to Mr. Burn's office.

   Burns: What in blue-blazes do you think you're doing, Simpson?
   Homer: What do you mean, sir?
   Burns: [showing Homer the photo]  I mean this!  [Homer gasps]  A plant
          employee carrying on like a over-sexed orangutan in heat!  This is a
          &lt;family&gt; nuclear power plant, Simpson.  Our research indicates that
          over fifty percent of our power is used by &lt;women&gt;.
   -- Read my lips:  No rude faxes! ``''

 Homer promises that it will not happen again.  Burns sends Smithers out,
 then changes his demeanor.

   Burns: [sadly]  Simpson, I am by most measures a successful man.  I have
          wealth and power beyond the dreams of you and your clock-punching ilk.
          And yet, I've led a solitary life.  The fair sex remains a mystery to
          me.  You seem to have a way with women, [gets up and stares out
          his window] a certain, how should I put it... Animal magneteasmuh [sic].
          [begging] Help me Simpson, tell me your secret.
   Homer: Uh, Mister Burns, in spite of what everybody thinks, I'm no loverboy.
   Burns: [pleasantly]  Simpson, I'm asking you nicely...
   Homer: I don't really know, sir.
   Burns: &lt;Simpson!&gt;
   Homer: Well oh, wine 'em... Dine 'em...
   Burns: [listens attentively]
   Homer: Bring them flowers..  Write them love poetry... sir.
   Burns: Of course!  It's simplicity itself!  I won't forget this Simpson.
          [angrily]  Now return to your work!... and tell no one of what
          transpired here.
   -- It'll be our little secret, ``''

 Homer returns home and is greeted warmly but quietly by his three children.
 Bart wishes Homer luck with Marge.

 Homer enters the kitchen.  Marge is sitting at the table.

   Homer: Hello Marge?  It's me, Homer.  Are you still mad?
   Marge: [continues scowling]
   Homer: You &lt;are&gt; still mad.  Don't need to say it, I'm your loving husband, I
          can read you like a book. [goes to the fridge]  I'll just have some
          milk. [using a glass]  Look!  I'm not drinking out of the carton!
          [breaks down]  Come on Marge!  Please forgive me! [goes down on his
          knees]  I'm sorry! I'm so sorry...
   Marge: [with contempt]  Homer, you don't even know why you're apologizing.
   Homer: Yes, I do.  Because I'm hungry, my clothes are smelly, and I'm tired.
   -- ``''

   Marge: You taught Bart a very bad lesson.  Your boy idolizes you.
   Homer: Oh, he does not.
   -- ``''

 Marge insists that he take Bart to ``to meet this exotic belly-person.
 I want him to see that she's a real human being with real thoughts and
 real feelings.  I want Bart to see you apologize for the way you treated
 her.''

 Homer drags Bart along to ``Florence of Arabia'', where the usher points
 him to the Girlesque.  Bart catches a glimpse of one of the dancers,before
 Homer yanks him away by the arm.  At the Girlesque, the attendant redirects
 Homer to Foxy Boxing.  At Foxy Boxing, Bart's view of the action is
 blocked by the paunches of Homer and the portly bouncer.  Next stop is
 Mud City...  Homer phones Marge to tell her he's trying one last place,
 ``The Sapphire Lounge.''  (``Bart!  I said look at the floor!'')

 Backstage at the Sapphire Lounge, they finally locate Princess Kashmir.

   Homer:   Hey Princess!  It's me!  The guy from the snap shot!
   Kashmir: [not very enthusiastically]  Oh, hi.
   Homer:   Look, I'm here because I want to apologize for treating you like an
            object.
   Kashmir: Uh-huh.
   Homer:   I also want my boy to find out that you're more than just a belly.
            I want to meet the woman behind all the
            spangles and glitter, and find out that she has thought and feelings
            too.
   Kashmir: Uh, oh, okay, but can we make it quick?
   Bart:    Nice to meet you ma'am.  [waves]
   Homer:   Could you tell him a little about yourself?
   Kashmir: Well, um, my real name is Shauna Tifton, my pet peeve is rude
            people, and my turn-ons include silk sheets and a warm fireplace.
   -- ``''

 During Shauna's brief profile, the cage she sits in slowly rises.  Homer
 rises with it.  Homer turns to leave and falls.  He hangs on for dear life.

 As the male entertainer begins his song, Shauna tries to shoo Homer out
 of her cage.  The performance proceeds with the curtains drawing back to
 reveal row upon row of scantly-clad women of all nations.

 Homer finally loses his grip, falling and bouncing across the stage.
 The singer eventually recognizes Homer and invites him to join the act.
 Monty Burns and Smithers are in the audience (with respective dates).

   Burns:    How does he do it, Smithers?
   Smithers: He's a love machine, sir.
   -- ``''

 Homer gets into the swing of things, then sees Bart looking on in
 admiration.  ``Uh-oh.''  He stops the music and asks to have a word.
 A tall beehive hairdo rises.  (``Burns: ``You with the hair!
 Down in front!'')  Marge sighs, ``Oh no, he's sunk even lower...''

   I have something to say to all the sons out there.  To all the boys,
   to all the men, to all of us.  It's about women, and how they are not
   mere objects with curves that make us crazy.  No, they are our wives,
   they are our daughters, our sisters, our grandmas, our aunts, our
   nieces and nephews---well, not our nephews.
   -- Homer, ``''

 His monologue touches everyone in the audience.  The singer phones his
 mother, and the men in the audience muse on their wives and children.

 With tears running down her face, Marge runs onstage and calls out to Homer,
 where they hug and smooch.  Bart shooes everyone away.

   All right folks, the show's over!  No more to see, folks, come on.
   Only sick people want to see my folks kiss!
   -- Bart, ``''

 EPISODE TITLE: The Crepes of Wrath


EPISODE SUMMARY: 

   

 Bart arrives home from school, littering the hallway with his skateboard
 and knapsack.  Bart enters his messy room and feeds his pet frog.

 Out in the hallway, Homer complains about the mess, picking up a Krusty
 doll to illustrate his point.  Bart's skateboard introduces Homer to the
 quick way to get downstairs.  (``D'oh!  D'ah!  Son-of-a!  D'aargh!'')
 His back injured, Homer is unable to move, his only company Bart's
 Krusty doll, which says, ``I like to play with &lt;you&gt;'' over and over and
 over and over again.  SLH wanders in.  ``Go get help, boy.''  The dog licks
 Homer's face and takes a nap.

 Maggie crawls over Homer's face, then quiets him with her pacifier.
 Maggie naps next to her father.  Pull upward to show Homer lying on
 the floor, surrounded by Maggie, the pets, and a Krusty doll whose
 batteries are near death.

 Marge and Lisa arrive home, and Homer says, ``The boy.  Bring me the boy.''
 Marge storms into Bart's messy room and yells, ``If you had cleaned
 your room when I asked you to, your father's trick back would still
 be aligned!''  While tossing his junk into the closet, Bart discovers...
 a cherry bomb.  ``I thought I blew all you guys up!''

 Recess.  Principal Skinner patrols the schoolyard, accompanied by his
 mother.  Bart shows the explosive to his pals, who ask him what he's
 going to do with it.  Before he can answer, Principal Skinner arrives,
 and the foursome (Bart, Milhouse, Lewis and Richard) quickly line up and
 greet Principal Skinner in unison.  Mrs. Skinner asks Spanky to introduce
 the boys, and he does so.
   
   Mrs. Skinner: This is the Bart Simpson you're always talking about?
   Pr. Skinner:  Mm hm.
   Mrs. Skinner: Why, he looks so sweet!
   Bart:         I am, ma'am.
   -- He also lies, ``''
   
 In the boys' room...
   
   Milhouse: You going to flush it?  [a cherry bomb]
   Bart:     What can I say?  I got a weakness for the classics.
   -- ``''
   
 Mrs. Skinner pays a visit to the little girls' room just as Bart flushes
 the cherry bomb.  Obvious consequences ensue.

 At the Simpsons' residence...
   
   Homer: [lying on the couch]  Oh, Maaarge, I'm still hurt!               \\
          [rings a handbell]  Maaarge!   Maaaaaarge!
   Marge: [finally arrives]  Oh, Homer.  How many times do I have to fluff
          your pillow?
   Homer: Actually, I was wondering if you could make me a grilled-cheese
          sandwich?
   Marge: [reluctantly]  Well, okay.
   Homer: Make sure it's squished flat, and crunchy on the outside.
   Marge: I know how you like 'em, Homer.
   Homer: Oh, and can I have some of those wieners that come in a can?
          Oh, and some fruit cocktail, in heavy syrup.
   Marge: Mmmmm...
   -- Milking an injury, ``''
   
 The doorbell rings, and Homer rings the handbell.  ``Maaaaarge!  Maaarge!
 MARGE!  GET THE DOOR!''  Marge peers through the peephole and gets a
 distorted view of Principal Skinner.  Bart escapes to his room as Marge
 brings Principal Skinner into the living room.  Homer remains on the couch.
   
   Homer:  Oh, hello, Principal Skinner.  I'd get up, but the boy crippled me.
   Principal Skinner: Mm hm.  I understand completely.
   -- ``''
   
   Pr. Skinner:  Mr. and Mrs. Simpson, we have transcended incorrigible.
          I don't think suspension or expulsion will do the trick.  I think it
          behooves us all to consider... deportation.
   Marge: Deportation!?  You mean, kick Bart out of the country?
   Homer: Eh, hear him out, Marge.
   -- ``''
   
 Skinner admits to being overly melodramatic.
   
   Pr. Skinner:  Our elementary school participates in a foreign exchange
          program.  Normally, a student is selection on the basis of academic
          excellence or intelligence.  But in Bart's case... I'm prepared to
          make a &lt;big&gt; exception.  And if you're willing to play along, he can
          be spending the next three months studying far, far away.
   Homer: Sounds great!
   -- ``''
   
 Marge scolds Homer for agreeing even without knowing what country Bart
 is going to.
   
   Pr. Skinner: He'd be staying in France, in a lovely chateau in the heart
          of the wine country.
   Marge: But Bart doesn't speak French.
   Pr. Skinner: Oh, when he's fully immersed in a foreign language, the average
          child can become fluent in weeks!
   Homer: Yeah, but what about Bart?
   Pr. Skinner: I'm sure he'll pick up enough to get by.
   -- ``''
   
 The Simpsons will be asked to host a student in exchange.
   
   Wait a minute, Skinner.  How do we know some principal over in France isn't
   pulling the same scam you are!
   -- Homer learns that Bart has been selected for an exchange program,
      ``''
   
   Pr. Skinner: You'll be getting an Albanian.
   Homer: You mean, all white with pink eyes?
   -- Student exchange program, ``''
   
 Marge thinks Bart should have some say in the matter.
   
   Ah, the life of a frog.  That's the life for me.
   -- Bart, ``''
   
 Bart loves the idea of going to France.
   
   He makes &lt;me&gt; crazy twelve months a year.  At least you get the summer off.
   -- Homer chats with Principal Skinner, ``''
   
   Bart:  And I'd get to take a plane there, wouldn't I, Mom?
   Marge: Yes, Bart.
   Bart:  And one back?
   -- We'll think about it, ``''
   
 Marge returns with Bart and announces that Bart has given the green light.
 Principal Skinner and Homer leap to their feet and exchange high fives.

 [End of Act One.  Time: 5:44]

 At Springfield International Airport, Marge kisses her ``special little guy''
 good-bye.  Lisa scowls, ``What do you know about France?''  Bart sneers
 back, ``I know I'm going and you're not.''
   
   Always remember that you're representing your country.  I guess what I'm
   saying is...  Don't mess up France the way you messed up your room.
   -- Homer sends Bart to France, ``''
   
 Bart is (literally) loaded onto the plane.  Meanwhile, in Tirana, Albania,
 a young boy bids farewell to his family.  (Mom, Dad, boy, sister, and baby
 girl.  Hmm...)

 Upon arrival in Paris, Bart is greeted by a surly young gentleman.  ``Okay,
 kid, let's go.''  Bart rides sidecar through the French countryside to
 Ch\^ateau Maison, a dilapidated vineyard.  An older man tells his donkey,
 ``Ah, Maurice.  Once the American boy arrives, your days of back-breaking
 work labor will be over.''  Bart arrives.

 Meanwhile, the rest of the family await the arrival of the exchange student.
 Lisa reads from a reference book.
   
   Lisa:  You know, in Albania, the unit of currency is called the lek.
   Homer: Heh heh heh.  The lek!
   Lisa:  And the national flag is a two-headed eagle on a red field.
   Homer: Give me the ol' stars-and-stripes!
   Lisa:  And the main export is furious political thought.
   Homer: Political what?
   -- ``''
   
 The plane carrying the exchange student lands.

 Meanwhile, the older gentleman (Cesar) introduces his nephew Huguolin (the
 gentleman who picked up Bart at the airport).
   
   You will find life here at the ch\^ateau hard, but if you shut up and
   do exactly what we say, the time will pass more quickly.
   -- Cesar, ``''
   
 ``He's right, you know,'' adds Huguolin.

 The young boy deplanes and greets the family members by name.  He kisses
 Homer once on each cheek.  ``Affectionate little Albanian, isn't he.''

 Bart's hosts go through his luggage and divvy up the proceeds.

 The students are gathered to welcome Adil Hoxha.
   
   You might find his accent peculiar.  Certain aspects of his culture may seem
   absurd, perhaps even offensive.  But I urge you all to give little Adil the
   benefit of the doubt.  This way, and only in this way, do we hope to better
   understand our backward neighbors throughout the world.
   -- Principal Skinner's introduction, ``''
   
 Adil addresses his fellow students.

 Cesar, Huguolin, and Maurice walk cheerfully along, followed by Bart,
 straining under the weight of water buckets.

 Dinnertime at the Simpsons.
   
   Adil:  How can you defend a country where five percent of the people
          control ninety-five percent of the wealth?
   Lisa:  I'm defending a country where people can think and act
          and worship any way they want.
   Adil:  Cannot!
   Lisa:  Can too!
   Adil:  Cannot!
   Lisa:  Can too!
   Homer: Please, please, kids, stop fighting.
          Maybe Lisa's right about America being the land of opportunity,
          and maybe Adil's got a point about the machinery of capitalism
          being oiled with the blood of the workers.
   -- The thoughts of a worker who does not control the means of production,
      ``''
   
 This succeeds in defusing the situation.
   
   Marge: I'll just clean the dishes...
   Adil:  No, Mrs. Simpson, you have been oppressed enough today.
          &lt;I&gt; will clear the dishes.
   -- ``''
   
   Did you see that?  This is the way I always wanted it to be!  We've become
   a fully-functioning family unit!  We've always blamed ourselves, but I
   guess it's pretty clear which cylinder wasn't firing.
   -- Homer trades Bart for Adil, ``''
   
 Lisa leaves the table in disgust.
   
   Oh, she's just jealous.  She'll get over it.
   And if she doesn't, we can always exchange her!  Heh, heh, heh.
   -- Homer on Lisa's recent ourburst, ``''
   
 Cesar and Huguolin enjoy their dinner of sausage, while Bart eats a raw
 turnip.  Huguolin orders Bart to go to sleep, and points at a pile of hay.
 But Maurice beats Bart to it, leaving our hero to sleep on the floor.

 Homer tucks Adil into bed.
   
   Homer: Look, Adil, you can call me `Dad'.
   Adil:  All right... `Dad'.
   Homer: Awwww, you called me `Dad'.
   -- ``''
   
 Adil asks to see the nuclear power plant.
   
   None of my biological kids ever wanted to see me at work...
   -- Homer, upon Adil's request to see SNPP, ``''
   
 Homer gladly agrees.  Adil says quietly to himself, ``Excellent...''

 Cesar instructs Bart on the proper way to pluck grapes.  ``Now do it a
 million times.''

 Homer takes Adil to SNPP.
   
   See these?  American donuts.  Glazed, powdered, and raspberry-filled.
   Now, how's &lt;that&gt; for freedom of choice!
   -- Homer introduces Adil to the American workplace, ``''
   
 Adil asks to see the plutonium isolation module.
   
   Homer: Hey, Lenny, does this place have one of those plutonium
          isolation deals?
   Lenny: Yeah, in Sector 12.
   Homer: Sector 12?
   Lenny: Third floor, by the candy machine.
   Homer: Oh, &lt;that&gt; Sector 12!
   -- ``''
   
 Bart carefully plucks grapes.  He looks around and pops one into his
 mouth.  Huguolin whaps him on the back, causing Bart to spit out the
 grape. ``Ungrateful swine!  We give you food, we give you shelter, and
 this is how you repay us?''

 A radiation-suited Adil snaps photos furiously as Homer takes him through
 the plant.  They reach the plutonium isolation module, marked ``TOP SECRET''.
 Adil snaps away, and Homer keeps leaning into the frame to wave hello.
 ``D'oh, wait a minute.''  Homer removes his radiation hood and smiles
 for the camera.

 Bart unhappily stomps grapes.  ``I hate France, ungh, ungh, ungh.''

 Marge and Homer chat in bed.  A framed portrait of Adil hangs on the wall.
 Marge makes Homer admit that he loves Bart, and Homer makes Marge admit
 that Adil is a very sweet boy.  (``Darn tootin'!'')

 Pan out Bart's window to the treehouse, which is filled with electronics
 equipment.  Adil prepares a fax machine and tunes his radio.  ``Sparrow to
 Nest.  Sparrow to Nest.  Stand by for transmission.''  In Tirana, the fax
 is received.  ``I told you the Sparrow would not fail.''  The two generals
 admire the photo of the plutonium isolation module, with a smiling Homer
 standing in front of it.

 [End of Act Two.]

 His feet purple with grape juice, Bart reads a letter from Marge.
   
   We think Maggie may say her first word any day now.
   -- Marge's letter to Bart, ``''
   
 Bart finishes the letter, moans quietly, and blows out the candle.

 Cesar and Huguolin inspect the wine vats.  Cesar is optimistic about this
 year's harvest, but Huguolin notes that the wine has been fermenting for
 only three days.
   
   Quand je sens que ma foi dans les forces supr\^emes faiblit,
   je pense toujours au miracle de l'anti-freeze.
   -- Cesar, ``''
   
   Whenever my faith in God is shaken, I think of the miracle of anti-freeze.
   -- Cesar, ``''
   
 ``Too much can be poison, but the right amount gives wine just the right
 kick.''  Cesar mixes some antifreeze with the wine.  Bart coughs outside,
 and Cesar shoos him away, then reconsiders.  He invites Bart in.  (``Watch.
 I bet it won't even blind him.'')
   
   Cesar: [shoves a cup of wine in Bart's face]  Drink this.
   Bart:  Oh, no thanks.
   Cesar: Do not worry.  This is France.  It is customary for children to take
          a little wine now and then.
   Bart:  Yeah, but it's got anti-freeze in there.
   Cesar: Drink it!
   -- ``''
   
 Bart swallows hard, downs the wine, belches, and waits.  Cesar waves his
 hand in front of Bart's face.
   
   He sees well enough.  Now go buy a case of anti-freeze.
   -- Cesar, ``''
   
 Huguolin doesn't want to go out in the rain, so they send Bart.

 Bart pedals to Paris in search of 14 Rue Voltaire, but gives up.  He flags
 down a passing policeman.  Unfortunately, there's a language problem.
 The policeman unwraps a candy.  ``Voil\`a un bonbon.''  Bart reluctantly
 takes it but is unable to communicate.  ``Je suis d\'esol\'e.''  Bart
 walks away, dejected.
   
   I'm so stupid.  Anybody could've learned this dumb language by now.
   Here, I've listened to nothing but French for the past |{deux mois,}
                                                          |[two months,]
   {et je ne sais pas un mot.}
   [And I haven't learned a word.]
   {Eh!  Mais, je parle Fran\c{c}ais maintenant!}
   [Wait!  I'm talking French now!]
   {Incroyable!}
   [Incredible!]
   -- Bart learns French, ``''
   
 He rushes back to the policeman.
   
   Bart: You gotta help me.  These two guys work me night and day.
         They don't feed me.  They make me sleep on the floor.
         They put anti-freeze in the wine, and they gave
         my red hat to the donkey.
   Policeman: [shocked]
         Anti-freeze in the wine?  That is a very serious crime.
   -- ``''
   
 Homer arrives home with something tucked under his arm.
   
   Oh, just some blueprints Adil wanted.
   I'm telling you, he's such a curious little Dickens.
   I bet he could &lt;build&gt; a nukeeler power plant if he wanted to!
   -- Homer fetches classified information for Adil, ``''
   
 A voice calls to the Sparrow to surrender.  Homer goes outside to see
 what the to-do is about.
   
   Homer: I'm his neighbor, what'd he do?
   Agent: [through the megaphone]  Well, sir, the...
          [turns off the megaphone] Well, sir...
   -- ``''
   
 The agent explains that they're closing in on a spy code-named ``The
 Sparrow''.  Homer thinks Adil might get a kick out of this.  Adil
 nervously drops his microphone out of the treehouse and attracts
 attention.  Homer waves hello, and is quickly trampled by dozens of
 FBI agents.

 In France, Cesar and Huguolin are placed in a paddy-wagon.  ``Au revoir,
 suckers!'' says Bart.  Bart makes headlines and receives a medal.

 At Springfield Airport, the agent explains that they will trade Adil
 for one of their own spies that had been captured.  The spy looks an
 awful lot like Bart.
   
   Spy:  So, Sparrow, we meet again.
   Adil: Yes.  Sometimes I think that I am getting too old for this game.
   -- ``''
   
 Adil bids the Simpsons farewell, and Marge and Lisa mumble farewell.
   
   Good-bye, Adil!  I'll send you those civil defense plans you wanted!
   -- Homer bids farewell to an Albanian spy, ``''
   
 Flight mille neuf cent quatre-vingt huit arrives from Paris.  Bart leaps
 off the plane and greets his family.  Lisa checks the bags Bart was
 carrying.  ``He brought us gifts!  His first unselfish act.''

 In the kitchen, Bart concludes his story.
   
   So, basically, I met one nice French person.
   -- Bart's summary of his trip to France, ``''
   
 Lisa says, ``It's good to see you,'' and Bart reflects the sentiment.
 Marge asks to try the wine Bart brought, as Homer struggles to open it.
   
   Some wise-guy stuck a cork in the bottle!
   -- Homer struggles to open a wine bottle, ``''
   
   Mon p\`ere!  Quel bouffon!
   -- Bart, ``''
   
 ``Ya hear that, Marge?  My boy speaks French!''  Homer finally uncorks
 the bottle with his teeth.

of Wrath'' is certainly a very good episode, especially for a French
native.  The depiction of the two bad guys is hilarious (I'll try to
explain why below), as well as the accent itself.  First, the
names: Maurice, Cesar (this should be C\'esar, with acute accent, but
who cares?)\ and Huguolin.  Maurice is a typical French name, very
common for men in their 40's or 50's. Definitly out of fashion, and
usually associated with countryside flavor (which tends to be
pejorative nowadays).  Needless to say, this doesn't reflect the
average IQ of all the Maurices in France, but so there.

Cesar and Huguolin are two very famous characters of French
litterature, from the novel ``Manon des sources'' (Manon of the
Springs), two corrupted, bad-manered peasants of the 30's.  They don't
happen to make wine, but steal the water from another guy's land by
obstructing his spring.  In fact, the story is rather intricate and
probably not interesting for Americans.  But Cesar and Huguolin
represent the archetype of the typical narrow-minded, twisted farmer
of France at the beginning of the century, ready to commit any abuse
for a little money.  Needless to say, this doesn't reflect the average
behaviour of all the farmers in France, but so there.

The funniest thing all along the episode is the accent.  The point is,
except the policeman (who speaks such a accentless French that it's
funny anyway), all the French speaking characters have a &lt;very thick&gt;
American accent.  Furthermore, Cesar and Huguolin's voicers have
tried to imitate the French countryside accent, which kept me rolling on
the floor with laughter.  Some of the sentences are very hard to catch,
even for a native, and a few words remain a mystery for me.  Oh well.  I
also like the way the French guys speak English (a very good catch of
the real French accent, putting `e' at the ends of sentences, or
rolling the `r').

Now, for those who plan to go to France for a vacation or an exchange
student program, let me state this:  It is possible to go in September,
to the southwest of France (the Bordeaux region) and spend a
marvelous (although exhausting) time, gathering the grapes.  Lots of
gigantic meals, free wine and girls (well, at least wine...),
in a friendly atmosphere.  No Cesar or Huguolin, and no risk of
anti-freeze!  Along this line, it's absolutly &lt;true&gt; that some crooks
tried to add anti-freeze to the wine in order to make it taste ``older''.
(Normally it takes at least one and up to 20 years to make a decent
wine.)	This, of course, is prohibited and the production is severely
controlled.  (I speak for France, now the situation can be somewhat
different in Italy or Spain, which produce lots of cheap wine.)

And out of curiosity, is it real Albanian?

 Now for the French part

Before Bart arrives...
\(
{|C\'esar:     Ah, Maurice. D\`es que le gar\,con am\'ericain arrive,
               tes jours d'esclavage sont finis.
||Translation: Ah, Maurice.  As soon as the American boy arrives,
               your days of slavery are over.
||Subtitle:    Ah, Maurice.  Once the American boy arrives /
               your days of back-breaking labor will be over.
|}\)
\\

Huguolin and C\'esar go through Bart's things:
\(
{|Huguolin:     C\'esar, regarde!  Nous sommes riches!
||Translation:  C\'esar, look!  We are rich!
||Subtitle:     Cesar, look!  We are rich!
|\smallskip
 |C\'esar:      Ceux-l\`a sont trop petits, mais on peut les vendre.
||Translation:  These are too small, but we can sell them.
||Subtitle:     These won't fit us, but we can sell them.
|\smallskip
 |Huguolin:     Regarde, Maurice.  Un beau chapeau rouge pour toi.
||Translation:  Look, Maurice.  A beautiful red hat for you.
||Subtitle:     And a red hat for you, Maurice.
|}\)
\\

Dinnertime...
\(
{|Huguolin:     Elle est bonne cette saucisse.
||Translation:  This sausage is really good.
||Subtitle:     Mmm.  Good sausage.
|\smallskip
 |C\'esar:      Oui tr\`es. Passe-moi le vin.
||Translation:  Yeah, a lot.  Give me the wine.
||Subtitle:     Yes.  Pass me the wine.
|}\)
So we have here the archetype of (1)~the typical rural French meal
and (2)~the typical rural French conversation.
\\

As Bart reads the letter from Marge...
\(
{|C\'esar:     Silence!
||Translation: Silence!
|}\)
But you knew that already.
\\

In the wine shack...
\(
{|C\'esar:      Ah, je crois que \,ca va \^etre notre meilleur cuv\'ee.
||Translation:  Ah, I think this is going to be our best vintage.
||Subtitle:     This will be our finest wine ever.
|\smallskip
 |Huguolin:     Mais le vin n'a ferment\'e que trois jours.
||Translation:  But the wine has only fermented for three days.
||Subtitle:     But it's only been fermenting for three days.
|\smallskip
 |C\'esar:      Quand je sens que ma foi dans les forces supr\^emes
                faiblit, je pense toujours au miracle de l'anti-freeze.
||Translation:  When my faith in the supreme forces weakens, I always
                think of the miracle of the antifreeze.
||Subtitle:     Whenever my faith in God is shaken,
                I think of the miracle of anti-freeze.
|}\)
I couldn't stop laughing at this one.  First, C\'esar pronounces &lt;cuv\'ee&gt;
(vintage) with an American ``u'', sounding &lt;coov\'ee&gt;, or using French
spelling, &lt;couv\'ee&gt;, which means ``clutch''!  Then there is this
incredible sentence refering to supreme forces.  I don't know for the
Americans, but it sounds crazy in French.
[It sounds crazy in English, too. --rjc]  Last, C\'esar says
&lt;antifreeze&gt; (we say &lt;antigel&gt; in French), which, combined
with the leading &lt;de l'&gt;, sounds almost like
&lt;dentifrice&gt; which means &lt;toothpaste&gt;!
\\

Continuing...
\(
{|C\'esar:      Si on en met trop, bien s\^ur, c'est du poison.
||Translation:  If you put put too much of it, of course, it's lethal.
||Subtitle:     Too much can be poison,
|\smallskip
 |C\'esar:      Mais dans les proportions voulues, \,ca donne du corps au vin.
||Translation:  But in the desired proportions, it gives body to the wine.
||Subtitle:     but the right amount gives wine just the right kick.
|}\)
``Corps'' is difficult to translate here, as I'm not a specialist of wine.
In fact, I realize I don't even know how to describe it properly.
Let's stick to ``body'', which is reasonably accurate.
\\

\(
{|Huguolin:     Je crois que tu en as mis trop.
                Tu vas tuer quelqu'un avec \,ca.
||Translation:  I think you put too much of it.
                You'll kill somebody with that.
||Subtitle:     You put in too much.  It may kill someone.
|\smallskip
 |C\'esar:      Tuer quelqu'un?  T'es fou!
||Translation:  Kill someone?  You're nuts!
||Subtitle:     Kill someone?  Don't be ridiculous.
|}\)
\\

As they're about to feed Bart the tainted wine...
\(
{|C\'esar:      Regarde, je te parie que \,ca va m\^eme pas le rendre aveugle.
||Translation:  Look, I bet you he's not even going to be blind.
||Subtitle:     Watch.  I'll bet it won't even blind him.
|}\)
The word ``aveugle'' is spoken in such a manner that only by consulting
the subtitle could I figure out what he said!
\\

\(
{|C\'esar:      Qu'est ce que je t'avais dit?
                Maintenant, vas nous chercher une caisse
                d'anti-freeze au magasin.
||Translation:  What did I tell you?
                Now, go and get us a case of antifreeze at the store.
||Subtitle:     He sees well enough.  Now go buy a case of anti-freeze.
|}\)
Here, &lt;d'anti-freeze&gt; really sounds like &lt;dentifrice&gt;.
\\

\(
{|Huguolin:     Mais il pleut!
                Est-ce qu'on peut attendre \`a faire le vin demain?
||Translation:  But it's raining!
                Can't we wait until tomorrow to make the wine?
||Subtitle:     But it's raining outside.  Let's make the wine tomorrow.
|}\)
It seems that Huguolin's voicer had problem with this sentence, which
sounds terrible. Besides, the &lt;\`a&gt; is incorrect.  It should be &lt;pour&gt;~(for)
or &lt;et&gt;~(and).
\\

\(
{|C\'esar:      On a d\'ej\`a perdu trois jours.
||Translation:  We've already lost three days.
||Subtitle:     We have already waited three days.
|}\)
Sounds like a good score for wine-making!
\\

\(
{|Huguolin:     Alors, envoie le gar\,con!
||Translation:  Then, send the kid!
||Subtitle:     Then send the boy.
|}\)
\\

Bart's visit to Paris.  Stores named &lt;La Rotisserie&gt; and &lt;Bon Dormir&gt;.
Bart spots a (not so) typical French policeman and tries to talk to him.
\(
{|Policeman:    Excusez-moi, je ne parle pas Anglais.
||Translation:  Excuse me, I don't speak English.
|}\)
Ah, ha, ha, ha, ha ha!  A French policeman &lt;never&gt; apologizes.  Besides,
this guy sounds like a shy school teacher who spent his life behind
his books (with a perfect, sweet, accentless French), not like the
average cop, who would have said: ``&lt;Ben alors petit, t'as perdu ta
m\`ere?&gt;''  (So shorty, lost your mum?)
\\

Bart's struggle with the language continues.
\(
{|Policeman:    Tiens, petit gar\,con.  Voil\`a un bonbon.
||Translation:  There, little boy.  here's a piece of candy.
|}\)
Do you &lt;really&gt; think French cops give sweets to lost American kids?
\\

\(
{|Policeman:    Je suis d\'esol\'e, j'aimerais vraiment pouvoir vous aider.
||Translation:  I'm sorry, I'd really like to help you.
|}\)
Come on!  An understanding cop?  Gimme a break, man!
\\

Bart complains to himself, ``Anybody could have learnt this dumb language
by now!''  (Sure, especially Homer!)
\(
{|Bart:         Here, I've listened to nothing but French for the past
                deux mois, / et je ne sais pas un mot.
||Translation:  two months, / And I don't know a word!
||Subtitle:     two months. / And I haven't learned a word.
|}\)
Not too bad an accent, for a beginner.
\\

\(
{|Bart:         Mais, je parle Fran\,cais maintenant! / Incroyable!
||Translation:  My, I speak French now! / Incredible!
||Subtitle:     Wait!  I'm talking French now! / Incredible!
|}\)
Indeed, it is.
\\

\(
{|Bart:         Hey, Monsieur, aidez-moi!
                Ces deux types me font travailler jour et nuit.
                Ils ne me donnent pas \`a manger,
                ils me font dormir par terre,
                ils mettent de l'antifreeze dans le vin,
                et ils ont donn\'e mon chapeau rouge \`a l'\^ane.
||Translation:  Hey sir, help me!
                Those two guys make me work day and night.
                They don't feed me,
                they make me sleep on the ground,
                they put antifreeze in the wine,
                and they gave my red hat to the donkey.
||Subtitle:     You gotta help me.  These two guys work me night and day. /
                They don't feed me.  They make me sleep on the floor. /
                They put anti-freeze in the wine,
                and they gave my red hat to the donkey.
|}\)
Note that the policeman gulps when Bart mentions the antifreeze.
Nothing is worse than to adulterate wine in France.
Death penalty at the very least.
\\

\(
{|Policeman:    De l'antifreeze dans le vin?
                Ah mais c'est s\'erieux \,ca!
                Viens avec moi, fiston, tu n'as plus rien \`a craindre.
||Translation:  Antifreeze in the wine?
                This is serious indeed!
                Come with me, boy, you've got nothing to fear anymore.
||Subtitle:     Anti-freeze in the wine?  That is a very serious crime. /
                Come along, boy.  There is nothing for you to fear now.
|}\)
Two major flaws here:  First, the French cop understands it all right away.
Usually you have to explain things four or five times just to get a
glimmer of comprehension.  Second, Bart is now all alone with a cop,
which typically means that he's in deep, deep trouble.
\\

\(
{|Bart:         Mon [???].  Vous aurez toujours une place dans mon c{\oe}ur.
||Translation:  My [???].  You will always have a place in my heart.
||Subtitle:     My savior.  You will always have a place in my heart.
|}\)
The first two words are covered by music and are impossible to figure out.
As for Bart's behaviour (thanking a cop), I can
see only one explanation:  Antifreeze poisoning.
\\

The bad guys get busted...
\(
{|Policeman:    He ben maintenant, vous ferez votre vin en prison!
||Translation:  Well, now, you'll make your wine in prison!
||Subtitle:     From now on you will be doing all your winemaking in prison.
|}\)
Ha, ha, ha.  Typical cop joke.
\\

\(
{|Huguolin:     Nous [????] les prisons!
||Translation:  We [????] the jails!
|}\)
The word marked [????] is not a French word. I swear it.
\\

\(
{|C\'esar:      Et tout \,ca, parce qu'on a particip\'e \`a un
                programme d'\'echange d'\'etudiants!
||Translation:  And all this because we were part of an student
                exchange program!
||Subtitle:     And all because we participated in a student exchange program.
|\smallskip
 |Bart:         Au revoir, suckers!
||Translation:  Bye bye, suckers!
|}\)
Note that Bart could have used the French equivalent of suckers, ``pigeons''.
\\

At the airport:
\(
{|Voice:        Air France, flight mille neuf cent quatre-vingt huit,
                Paris to Springfield, is now arriving.
||Translation:  Air France, flight 1988, Paris to Springfield, is now arriving.
|}\)
\\

Back at home, Bart muses to himself...
\(
{|Bart:         Mon p\`ere, quel bouffon.
||Translation:  My father.  What a buffoon.
||Subtitle:     My father.  What a buffoon.
|}\)
All in all, pretty funny. Nevertheless, I wonder why they didn't take
real French speakers.  (Hey, they could have asked me!)  Now don't
tell me it was too difficult to find.  The depiction of France was as
grotesque as I expected (Bart met one nice person in France), and
Groening et al.\ captured some of the worse features you can find on a
trip to France.  (Wonder where he got his info.)
}

 But antifreeze is so sweet and tasty!


The antifreeze is a reference to an actual case in which small amounts of
diethylene glycol were found in wine.  In the commentary to the Season 1 DVD,
the writers indicate that it was probably a mistake, but that's not the whole
truth.

A few Austrian winemakers wanting to comete with the more highly-rated Germanic
wines, so they started adding diethylene glycol, a close cousin to antifreeze
(and may be a component of some antifreezes), which causes the wine to be
sweeter and more viscous.  This was discovered when one winery listed the
chemical in its tax returns.  There are reports of various importers relabeling
the wine and trying to pass it off as domestic, unaware of the antifreeze.

Ironically, the 1985 Austro-Germanic Diethylene Glycol Wine Scandal caused
Austria to implement extremely strict wine laws, such that Austrian wine is now
very highly regarded.


 Miscellaneous


You'd think the water in the toilet bowl would've extinguished the fuse
on the cherry bomb.

Andrew Gill responds: Not necessarily!  Some fuses are waterproof (before
and/or after ignition), and some explosive devices will continue to work if
they start out of water (Not that anyone in my family would have
ever--ahem--tried this).  Besides--as Bart says, this is a classic.  People
have been doing this since toilets were invented.

 EPISODE TITLE: Krusty Gets Busted


EPISODE SUMMARY: 

   

 Krusty putters on stage and greets his audience.
   
   Krusty: Hi, kids!  Who do you love?
   Kids:   Krusty!
   Krusty: How much do you love me?
    :      [Bart and Lisa watch the show at home]
   Bart+Lisa+Kids: With all our heart!
   Krusty: What would do if I went off the air?
   Bart+Lisa+Kids: We'd kill ourselves!
   -- Making life worth living, ``''
   
 Krusty and Sideshow Bob (who does not speak but rather uses a slide whistle)
 are joined on stage by Brittany, a young girl celebrating her birthday.
 Brittany has a choice:  Either Krusty can sing her a birthday song, or they
 can shoot Sideshow Bob out of a cannon.  The audience chants, ``The cannon!
 The cannon!''\ and Brittany chooses the cannon.

 Sideshow Bob is loaded in the cannon, and Krusty suggests that the reason
 the cannon trick never worked before is that they didn't use enough
 gunpowder!  Brittany ignites the cannon, but when the gunpowder explodes,
 the cannon recoils off the stage.  The cannon tips forward, and Sideshow
 Bob oozes out.  Krusty leads the kids in a tag line...
   
   Krusty: Don't blame me...
   Krusty+Kids:  &lt;I&gt; didn't do it!
   -- Words to live by, ``''
   
   Comedy, thy name is Krusty.
   -- Bart, ``''
   
 Next up is an Itchy and Scratchy cartoon.
   
   Bart+Lisa:  [laugh at an Itchy and Scratchy cartoon]
   Marge: My, all this senseless violence.  I don't understand the appeal.
   Bart:  We don't expected you to, Mom.
   Lisa:  If cartoons were meant for adults, they'd put them on in prime time.
   -- ``''
   
   If cartoons were meant for adults, they'd put them on in prime time.
   -- Lisa, ``'
   
 At work, Homer's donut-dunking is interrupted by a phone call from Marge,
 who asks him to pick up a half gallon of Premium ice cream on his way
 home from work.  Homer suspects a trick, and his fears are confirmed when
 Marge explains that Patty and Selma are going to show slides of their
 trip to the Yucatan.  (``D'oh!'')

 There's a knock at the door.  The Bouvier twins have arrived.
   
   Oooooh, eight carousels!  We're in for a real treat!
   -- Marge welcomes her sisters, laden with slides of their latest trip,
      ``''
   
 Bart and Lisa are not pleased by this.

 Homer ambles into the Kwik-E-Mart...
   
   Hello, steady customer!  How are you this evening, sir?
   -- Apu welcomes Homer, ``''
   
 ... and walks past a masked Krusty, heating up a burrito in the microwave.
   
   Mmm... Chocolate...
   Ooooh, double chocolate...
   Gasp!  New flavor!  Triple chocolate!
   -- Homer buys ice cream, ``''
   
 He also picks up ``something for the trip back to the cash register'',
 walking past Krusty hiding inconspicuously behind a magazine.
   
   What's the matter, sir?  Never have I seen you so unhappy when you are
   purchasing such a large quantity of ice cream.
   -- Apu to Homer, ``''
   
 As Homer explains that he's going home to suffer through a slide show hosted
 by ``the gruesome twosome'', Krusty crosses over and gets in line behind
 Homer.  As Homer leaves, he accidentally steps on Krusty's foot (earning
 a tongue-lashing), and sees that Krusty has a gun.  Homer dives into the
 potato chips display.
   
   Krusty: [holding a gun]  Hand over all your money in a paper bag.
   Apu:    Yes, yes, I know the procedure for armed robbery.
           I do work in a convenience store, you know.
   -- ``''
   
 Krusty takes the money and leaves.
   
   You can emerge now from my chips.
   The opportunity to prove yourself a hero is long gone.
   -- Apu to a (cowardly) Homer, ``''
   
 Meanwhile, Marge and the kids suffer through a slide show.
 (Bart wears a sombrero, Lisa a red poncho.)
   
   Patty: This is a Mexican delicacy called a `taco platter'.
   Selma: Mmm, delicious.
   -- Narrating a slide show of their trip to the Yucatan, ``''
   
 Next is a slide of Selma taking a siesta in her bra.  Says Bart,
 ``Aye, Carumba!''

 Back at the Kwik-E-Mart, Homer describes the perpetrator to a sketch artist.
 Only after the artist finishes the drawing does Homer recognize the face as
 Cruddy, Crummy... Krusty the Clown!

 In his apartment, Krusty mixes himself a drink and relaxes.  Through the
 windows burst a SWAT team, and Krusty is thrown to the floor, a gun pointed
 at his head.
   
   Krusty: Hey, what's going on, here?
   Wiggum: Krusty the Clown, you're under arrest for armed robbery.
           You have the right to remain silent.
           Anything you say, blah blah blah, blah blah blah blah blah.
   -- You know the rest, ``''
   
 Homer is called to the station to identify Krusty in a line-up.
   
   Send in the clowns!
   -- Chief Wiggum prepares for a police line-up, ``''
   
 A group of clowns is brought in, and Homer has trouble containing his
 laughter.  (``If the crime is making me laugh, they're &lt;all&gt; guilty!'')
 Homer eventually identifies Krusty.

 Back at home, even Marge is bored of the slide show.
   
   And this is all the mail that awaited us upon our return.
   [click, next slide]
   And this is Selma dropping off our vacation film to be developed.
   Thus concludes our Mexican Odyssey.
   -- Patty shows vacation slides, ``''
   
 The kids have already fallen asleep.  ``Very... thorough,'' says Marge as
 she turns on the light.  Homer finally arrives and begins telling the story
 of his ordeal, but decides to let the TV news tell the story.
   
   Why did the clown cross the road?
   To rob a Kwik-E-Mart.
   A new story behind that enigmatic half-joke after this commercial message.
   -- Scott Christian anchors the newscast, ``''
   
 During the commerical (for Duff Beer), Homer talks to Bart about Krusty.
   
   Homer: Bart, you know that guy on your lunchbox?
   Bart:  Oh, you mean Krusty the Clown?
   Homer: He's sort of a hero of yours, isn't he?
   Bart:  Are you kidding?  He's my idol!
          I've based my life on Krusty's teaching.
   -- Krusticism?  ``''
   
 Homer tries to get Bart out of the room before the news returns, but too
 late.  Bart: ``Gasp!  Krusty!''  Lisa:  ``Oh, no!''  Maggie: *suck* *suck*.
   
   Earlier this evening, the Springfield SWAT team apprehended
   the TV clown, who appears on a rival station, opposite our
   own Emmy award winning Hobo Hate.
   -- Scott Christian's news flash, ``''
   
 And just in, surveillance film from the Kwik-E-Mart security camera.
 Homer's remark about the ``gruesome twosome'' is broadcast for all to hear.
 Bart is crushed, but Marge suggests that perhaps Krusty is innocent.
   
   Earth-to-Marge.  Earth-to-Marge.  I was there.  The clown is G-I-L-L-T-Y.
   -- Homer, ``''
   
 In his room, Bart glumly stares at his huge Krusty poster, then picks up
 a Krusty doll.  He pulls the string, and it says, ``You're
 my best friend.''  Another pull.  ``Buy my cereal!  Wuh-huh-huh-huh!''
 And, ``&lt;I&gt; didn't do it!''

 [End of Act One.  Time: 7:14]

 Over a snazzy graphic ``'', Kent Brockman anchors the news.
   
   Good evening again, Springfield.  Krusty the Klown, the beloved idol of
   countless tots, now nothing more than a common (alleged) criminal.
   -- Kent Brockman reports... ``''
   
   His trial, which begins tomorrow, has taken center ring in a national media
   circus, as children of all ages, from 8 to 80, hang onto each new
   development like so many Rumanian trapeze artists.
   -- Kent Brockman reports... ``''
   
 He continues, ``From his humble beginnings as a street mime in Tupelo,
 Mississippi, Krusty climbed to the top of a personal mini-empire, with
 dozens of endorsements including his line own line of pork products.
 This may have led to one of television's best-loved bloopers, his near
 fatal heart-attack, in 1986.''
   
   Krusty: Wasn't that a great Itchy and Scratchy cartoon, kids?
           Well, we've got another one coming right up.
           But first!  I've got a hankerin' for some pork products!
           [Sideshow Bob wheels in a barebecue grill]
           Mmmm.... Look!  Plump, succulent sausage.  Honey-smoked bacon.

 ``But a triple-bypass and a pacemaker later, Krusty bounced back.  However,
 he was a changed clown.  Where his show had been condemned by parents and
 educators alike as simple-minded TV mayhem...''  Sideshow Bob slowly mashes
 a cream pie into Krusty's face.  Krusty punches Sideshow Bob in the mouth.
 ``... this `new' Krusty devoted a small portion of every show to stamping
 out illiteracy in today's anything-for-a-thrill youth.''  Krusty holds
 up a book (upside-down) and says, ``Give a hoot!  Read a book!''

 Reverend Lovejoy calls upon the citizens of Springfield to gather up the
 merchandise related to the ``Clown Prince of Corruption'' for a public
 burning.

 Krusty's trial begins tomorrow.  Fade to an un-made-up Krusty in prison
 garb, taken into the courthouse.
   
   Bart:   Look at him.  His clothes are so drab.
   Lisa:   His face is so flesh-colored and sad.
   Bart:   And his feet.  They're so small.
           [grabs Krusty] Say it ain't so, Krusty!
   Atty:   Uh, my client has no comment at this time.
   Krusty; [meekly]  I didn't do it!
           [all laugh as Krusty is dragged away on his heels]
   -- Once a clown, always a clown.  ``''
   
 In court...
   
   Judge:  Krusty the Clown, how do you plead?
   Krusty: [brightly] I plead guilty, your honor.
           [huge gasp from the crowd, Krusty looks around surprised]
   Atty:   [whispers into Krusty's ear]
   Krusty: Oh, heh heh heh, not guilty, heh heh heh.
           Opening-night jitters, your honor.
   -- Just picture them in their underwear, ``''
   
 The prosecuting attorney calls Homer to the stand.  Bart begs Homer not to
 do it, to no avail.
   
   Mr. Simpson, was that you taking that cowardly dive into that display of
   heavily-salted snack treats?
   -- Prosecutor at Krusty's trial, ``''
   
 The prosecutor invites Homer to point out the man who held up the
 Kwik-E-Mart.   Homer raises his finger and sees Bart silently begging
 and pleading.  Homer fingers Krusty.  Bart puts his head in his hands.
 (``Oh, man...'')  The prosecutor asks that the record show that Homer
 ``eventually'' pointed at Krusty.

 In Lisa's room, Marge tosses all Krusty-related merchandise into a
 brown paper bag, including the Krusty pacifier Maggie is sucking on.
   
   These toys are just adorable.  Who would have guessed they were inspired
   by an insane criminal genius.
   -- Marge throws out Krusty-related toys, ``''
   
 Maggie puts a new pacifier in her mouth.  Homer meanwhile loads up a
 wheelbarrow with the Krusty stuff in Bart's room.
   
   Bart:  Dad, you're giving in to mob mentality!
   Homer: No I'm not, I'm hopping on the bandwagon!
          Now come on, son, get with the winning team!
   -- ``''
   
 The toy burning is about to begin.  (A souvenir stand nearby sells
 Krusty dolls.  ``Buy 'em an' burn 'em!'')
   
   Good people, I'm so happy you're all here tonight.  But please, just a few
   words of caution.  Now, we are going to set this pile of evil ablaze, but
   because these are children's toys, the fire will spread quickly, so please
   stand back and try not to inhale the toxic fumes.
   -- Reverend Lovejoy coordinates a Krusty-burning, ``''
   
 *Foom!*  The pile ignites in a mushroom cloud of flame.  Bart watches
 sadly.

 At the trial, the prosecutor asks Krusty to identify exhibit B, but Krusty
 can't.  He confesses that he's illiterate, to the shock of all.  ``Is it
 a crime to be illiterate?''  The prosecutor shows him exhibit B...
   
   Prosecutor: Betting slips, indicating that you've lost substantial sums
               of money on sports gambling.
   Krusty:     [dramatically]  Is it a crime to bet on sporting events?
   Prosecutor: Yes, it is!
   Krusty:     [meekly]  Oh.
   -- Krusty's trial, ``''
   
 The jury has reached a verdict.
   
   Foreperson: We find the defendant, Krusty the Clown...  Guilty.
   Crowd:      [gasp!]
   Defense Attorney:  Ugh!  [bangs the table]  I knew it!
               This happens to me every time!
   -- ``''
   
 At home, Lisa and Maggie watch the Krusty the Clown show, sans Krusty.
 Sideshow Bob puts his slide whistle to his lips, then sets it back down.
 ``My young friends, for years I have been silent, save for the crude
 glissandos of this primitive wind instrument.  But now, destiny has thrust
 me in the center ring!  In the coming weeks, you will notice some rather
 sweeping changes in our program.  Please do not be alarmed, Itchy and
 Scratchy will still have a home here.  But we will also learn about
 nutrition, self-esteem, etiquette, and all the mindly arts...''
 Bart comes in.  ``What the hell are you doing, Lis?''  Lisa is watching
 Sideshow Bob.  Bart sneers, ``You back-stabber!  You traitor!  You...''
 Lisa slaps him.  ``Snap out of it, Bart!  Face the facts!  All those hours
 we spent staring at Krusty, we were staring at a crook!''  Bart shuts
 off the television set and says he knows Krusty is innocent.
   
   Bart: I bet I can prove Krusty's innocent, but... [meekly] I need your help.
   Lisa: [genuinely not knowing]  You do?  Why?
   Bart: Oh, come on, Lis, you know why.
   Lisa: No!  Why?
   Bart: I'll never forgive you for making me say this, but...
         [deep breath]  You're smarter than me.
   Lisa: [adorable smile]
   -- ``''
   
 Lisa agrees to join Bart.  First stop, the scene of the crime.
   
   [hiding behind the counter]
   Okay, don't try anything funny.  I'm armed to the teeth.
   -- Apu, once bitten twice shy, ``Krusty the Clown''
   
 Lisa points out the sign on the microwave:  ``People with pacemakers should
 stay away from this thing.''  Says Bart, ``So?  &lt;I&gt; don't have a pacemaker.''
 Lisa explains that Krusty does, yet the surveillance film shows Krusty
 at the microwave.  Next, Lisa reminds Bart that Krusty can't read.
 (``Okay, okay, so the poor guy can't read, will ya get off his back
 already?'')  Yet the surveillance film shows Krusty reading a magazine.
   
   Hey, hey, this is not a lending library!
   If you're not going to buy that thing, put it down or I'll blow your heads off!
   -- Apu, ``''
   
 Lisa agrees that Krusty was framed.  But by whom?  Bart suggests they talk
 to Krusty's best friend in the whole world:  Sideshow Bob.

 Sideshow Bob finishes a reading from Chapter 34 of The Man in the Iron Mask,
 then concludes with a song.  Heading into his dressing room, Sideshow Bob
 bites his finger and sobs for poor Krusty.  Once inside, the sobs turn into
 an evil cackle...

 [End of Act Two.  Time: 16:04]

 In his dressing room, Sideshow Bob enjoys a glass of wine while chatting
 with various folks wanting to merchandise his likeness.  A security guard
 informs him that there are some kids who would like to talk to him, and
 the suits offer to defer the contract-signing to tomorrow, then leave.

 Bart, Lisa, and Maggie are shown in.  As Sideshow Bob puts on his shoes,
 he says it's close to show time and gives the kids free tickets.

 The show begins.  He asks the kids, ``Who&lt;m&gt; do you love?'' (Grammer on
 grammar) and the kids respond, ``Sideshow Bob!''  Bart remains silent.
   
   Come on, Bart, go with the flow!
   -- Lisa, ``''
   
 Sideshow Bob spots an unhappy child in the audience (Bart) and invites
 him to chat.  Bart is reluctant, but Lisa shoves him onstage.
   
   Sideshow Bob: So what's on your mind, Bart?  Is it that other children
                 don't accept you?
   Bart:         Sure, Sideshow Bob, but that doesn't bother me.
   -- Armchair psychiatry, ``''
   
 Bart says that he and his sisters think Krusty was framed.  First, the
 thief used a microwave, but Krusty couldn't.  Sideshow Bob responds that
 Krusty was not the sort of person to follow doctor's orders.  Next,
 Bart mentions the magazine...
   
   The fact is, you don't have to be able to read to enjoy the Springfield
   Review of Books.  Just look at these amusing caricatures of Gore Vidal
   and Susan Sontag.
   -- Sideshow Bob, ``''
   
 Bart concedes the point.  Sideshow Bob admits that he has big shoes to
 fill.  The phrase ``big shoes to fill'' echo through Bart's mind as he
 remembers that Homer stepped on the thief's foot, yet Krusty has small
 feet.  On the other hand, Sideshow Bob has large feet...
   
   There was a school of thought called stoicism...
   -- Sideshow Bob hosts his Cavalcade of Whimsy, ``''
   
 Bart levels his accusation at Sideshow Bob.  He grabs the microphone.
   
   Bart: Attention, fellow children!  Krusty didn't rob that store!
         Sideshow Bob framed him, and I got proof!
         [whams Sideshow Bob's foot with a mallet]
   Sideshow Bob: [hopping and grabbing his foot]
         Ow!  You lousy, stupid clumsy...
   Kids: Gasp!
   Bart: See that?  Krusty wore big, floppy shoes, but he's got little feet,
         like all good-hearted people.  [whams Sideshow Bob's other foot]
   Sideshow Bob: [on the floor, grabbing his feet]
   Bart: But Sideshow Bob really filled those shoes with these ugly feet!
         [removes Sideshow Bob's shoe, revealing his big, ugly feet]
   The Cop:  [watching the show, eating donuts]  Kid's right.
   The Other Cop: [doing the same]  How do you suppose we missed that?
   -- ``''
   
 Chief Wiggum (holding a donut and watching the show in his office) tells
 the two cops to go down and arrest Sideshow Bob.

 Outside the studio, Sideshow Bob, in handcuffs, dramatically confesses
 to his crime.  He couldn't stand being the constant victim of Krusty's
 on-screen pranks.
   
   And I would've gotten away with it, too, if it weren't for these meddling kids.
   -- Sideshow Bob, ``''
   
   Treat kids like equals!  They're people too!  They're smarter than you think!
   They were smart enough to catch me!
   -- Sideshow Bob is carted away to jail, ``''
   
 Krusty is released from prison (in makeup and his stage clothes, complete
 with squeaky shoe), to great applause.  Chief Wiggum makes an apology,
 as does Homer.
   
   I sincerely hope that the horrible stories I heard about what goes on in
   prison are exaggerated.
   -- Homer to Krusty, ``''
   
 Krusty thanks the one boy whose faith never wavered:  Bart.  The handshake
 is captured in a photo, which Bart tacks on his wall.  The picture is
 inscribed in shaky handwriting, ``To my best pal Bart, Krusty''.
 Bart goes to bed, nestled comfortable under his Krusty blanket, his
 room filled with Krusty merchandise.

 EPISODE TITLE: Some Enchanted Evening


EPISODE SUMMARY: 

   

 Breakfast at the Simpsons.  Homer and the kids chow down while Marge watches,
 standing and sipping her coffee.  The radio is tuned to the KBBL traffic
 report.
   
   Bad news, drivers.  There's an overturned melon truck on the interstate.
   Oh, it's a mess.  There's lots of rubber-necking and melon wrestling
   going on, folks...
   -- Bill Pie ``in the Sky'', KBBL traffic report, ``''
   
 Homer reaches for the milk, revealing a box of ``Yummy Donuts''.  Bart
 and Lisa struggle for custody of the box (Maggie's eyes watch the
 back-and-forth) until the donut pops out of the box, bounces off Homer's
 head, and lands on his plate.  Homer inhales the pastry.

 The school bus honks its horn, and the kids head out.  Marge holds up two
 lunchboxes:  ``You forgot the special lunches I made.''  Bart and Lisa
 help themselves to Marge's purse.  ``That's okay, Mom!'' responds Bart.
 ``We got money!'' finishes Lisa as she replaces the purse in Marge's
 pocketbook.  Marge's protest is interrupted by a ``Yaaaargh!'' from
 Homer as he glances at his watch and gets up.  Marge closes her eyes
 for a kiss, but Homer takes and drinks her coffee then leaves.

 Overhead shot of the kitchen wreckage.  ``Well, Maggie, it's just you
 and me again.''  Maggie has fallen asleep.
   
   This is KBBL talk radio, K-Babble.  All talk, 24 hours a day.
   If you'd like to share your embarrassing problem with our listening
   audience, we invite you to call our therapist of the airwaves, Dr. Marvin
   Monroe.  The number is 555-PAIN.
   [Marge drums her fingers and casts nervous glances at the phone]
   Don't be afraid, call now!
   [Marge dashes for the phone]
   -- ``''
   
 Marge starts to explain her problem.  ``Hey lady, save your whining for
 when you're on the air, okay?''

 At the plant, Homer listens to the radio.  Dr. Monroe snuffs out his
 cigarette, reaches for another donut, and selects his next call.
   
   Dr.MM: Next we have Marge.  She's 34 and trapped in a loveless sham of
          a marriage.
   Homer: Hey, turn it up!  I love hearing those wackos!
   -- The SNPP workers listen to a radio call-in show, ``''
   
   Dr.MM: [radio talk show therapist]  Tell me about your husband, Marge.
   Marge: [on the phone] When we were dating, he was sweeter... and more
          romantic! ...  [beginning to sob]  And forty pounds thinner,
          and he had hair... [burbling barely coherently]  And he ate
          with utensils!  [breaks down crying]
   -- Marge calls KBBL, ``''
   
 Homer refuses to believe that it's his wife calling.
   
   Dr.MM: Your husband sees you as nothing.
   Marge: [pause]  Oh, okay.  Well, thank you.  [about to hang up]
   Dr.MM: No no no, don't hang up!
   -- Marge calls a radio talk show therapist, ``''
   
 The plant employees nudge each other knowingly.
   
   Dr.MM: The pig has made you into his mother.
          You are not the hot love object you deserve to be!
   Marge: Really?
   Dr.MM: I'm as sure of it as I'm sure my voice is annoying.
          Marge, tonight, the second he comes through that front door, you've got
          to tell him you're fed up, and if he doesn't start loving you,
          you will be leaving.
   Marge: Leave Homer!?
   Dr.MM: Please!  Don't use his real name!
   Marge: Leave Pedro!?
   -- Marge calls a radio talk show therapist, ``''
   
 The employees crack up.  Homer swallows hard.

 At the Simpsons residence...
   
   Lisa: Aw, come on, Bart, not again!
   Bart: [dialing the phone] Aw, where's your sense of humor.
   Moe:  Moe's Tavern.
   Bart: Hello, is Al there?
   Moe:  Al?
   Bart: Yeah, Al.  Last name:  Coholic.
   Moe:  Lemme check...  [calls]  Phone call for Al.  Al Coholic.
         Is there an Al Coholic here?
         [bar denizens laugh]
         Wait a minute...
         [to phone]
         Listen, you little yellow-bellied rat jackass, if I ever find out
         who you are, I'm gonna kill you!
   -- ``''
   
 Homer's at the bar, dreading going home.  While Homer eats a pickled
 egg, he explains that Marge is going to leave him because he's a pig.
 Moe agrees; he &lt;is&gt; a pig.  Homer goes for a second opinion.
   
   Homer:  Hey, Barney, am I a pig?
   Barney: You're even more of a pig than I am!   [huge belch]
   -- From someone who should know, ``''
   
   Moe: Homer, buy your wife some flowers and take her out for a night on the
        town.  Candles, tablecloth, the whole nine yards.
   -- Gee, I didn't mean to put you to so much trouble, ``''
   
 And after dinner, Moe suggests they check into a motel.  Homer likes the
 idea and heads out.

 The kids sit at the dinner table.  ``Wow, a quarter past six.  What's
 keeping Dad?'' asks Lisa.  Bart mutters, ``Yeah, he couldn't possibly
 be late on Meatloaf Night.''

 Homer wanders into the florist shop.
   
   Homer:   [unsure of himself]  Uh, I'd like some flowers.
   Florist: What kind of flowers?
   Homer:   Uh, you know, pretty ones, not dead.
   Florist: Well, we've have some beautiful long-stemmed roses.  They're $55
            a dozen.
   Homer:   [thinks]  One, please.
   -- Think small, ``''
   
 It's now 8:35.  Marge stares angrily at the front door, growling.
 The kids approach her from behind with their empty plates and ask for
 some food.  Marge turns around and *ROARS*.  The kids scream and dash
 off in fright.  Marge turns back towards the door and waits...

 [End of Act One.  Time: 5:33]

 As Marge growls at the door, evil thoughts penetrate her mind, and her
 eyes turn red...

 Outside in the rain, Homer holds a heart-shaped box of candy in one hand
 and a wilted rose in the other.  He practices his entrance, but realizes
 it's no use and just heads for the door.  Marge pulls the door open as
 Homer tries to insert the key.  Stunned, Homer holds up the candy and
 the flower.  ``I love you, Marjorie.''  Marge softens, and they kiss.

 In the kitchen, Bart dials the phone...
   
   Bart: [dialing the phone] A little pre-dinner entertainment.
   Moe:  [answering the phone]  Moe's Tavern.
   Bart: Is Oliver there?
   Moe:  Who?
   Bart: Oliver Clothesoff.
   Moe:  Hold on, I'll check.  [calls]  Oliver Clothesoff!  Call for Oliver
         Clothesoff!
   Bart+Lisa: [laugh]
   -- ``''
   
 Homer fills Marge in on their itinerary...
   
   Homer: And, I made reservations at Chez [pron. /chez/] Paree!
   Marge: Oh, but Homer, that's expensive!
   Homer: It matters not, mon frere!
   -- A night on the town with the boys?  ``''
   
 Marge picks up the phone to call a babysitter, and hears Moe:  ``Listen,
 you lousy bum, if I ever get a hold of you, I &lt;swear&gt; I'll cut
 your belly open!''  She hangs up, figuring it was a crossed wire,
 and tries again.  She calls the Rubber Baby Buggy Bumper Babysitting
 Service, but they refuse when she identifies herself as Mrs. Simpson.
   
   Clerk: Rubber Baby Buggy Bumper Babysitting Service!
   Homer: Hello, this is Mr... Sam-son.
   Clerk: Did your wife just call a second ago?
   Homer: No, I said Samson, not Simpson.
   -- Just checking, ``''
   
   Actually, the Simpsons are neighbors of ours, and we've found them to be a
   quite misunderstood and underrated family.
   -- Homer pretends to be Mr. Samson, ``''
   
 Upstairs, Lisa watches Marge pretty herself up for a night out.
 Bart listens to Homer talk about his mambo dancing, but his smart
 mouth gets him thrown out.  Homer shaves (and his beard grows back
 almost immediately).

 The doorbell rings, and Homer tells Bart to answer it.
   
   Aye-aye, Mambo-Man!
   -- Bart, ``''
   
 Bart slides down the banister (*thud*) and answers the door as Lisa
 and Maggie join him.  He opens the door.  The kids swallow hard.
 It's the babysitter.  (Insert jarring chord.)  Curiously, Ms. Botz
 has brought two suitcases.  Marge leaves her with brief instructions:
 Maggie should be put to bed immediately; Bart and Lisa can watch
 ``The Happy Little Elves Meet The Curious Bear Cub''.
   
   [moaning] Oh!  The Elves!  The Elves!
   -- Quasi-Bart-o, ``''
   
 Marge kisses the kids good-bye.  Bart tries to get Ms. Botz to approve
 alternate viewing, but a menacing threat puts him in his place.  Ms. Botz
 carries Maggie away to bed.  (Maggie waves bye-bye.)

 At the restaurant, Homer checks out the lobster tank and chooses...
 the one floating upside-down at the top.

 Bart suffers through the Happy Little Elves...
   
   Bart: [watching a Happy Little Elves tape] Oh, man, I can't take it any more!
   Lisa: But I want to see what happens.
   Bart: You &lt;know&gt; what happens.  They find Captain Quick's treasure.
         All the elves dance around like little green idiots.  I puke.  The End.
   Lisa: Bart, you're just like Chilly, the elf who cannot love.
   -- ``''
   
 Bart switches to ``America's Most Armed and Dangerous'', though Lisa
 finds the show too scary.
   
   The Cue-ball Killer should be considered extremely armed and dangerous.
   If you think you've seen him, call 1-800-U-SQUEAL.
   -- ``''
   
 At the restaurant, the bubbly stops flowing, so Homer orders another bottle
 of their second-cheapest champagne.

 Back at the house...
   
   The defenseless youngsters were tied up and gagged in the living
   room, while the bandit roamed the house at will,
   [TV pans over an empty house]
   stealing the valuable objects it took the family a lifetime to shop for!
   -- Watching `America's Most Armed and Dangerous', ``''
   
 To the music of the Larry Davis Experience, Homer and Marge mambo divinely.

 Meanwhile, Bart and Lisa watch more of America's Most Armed and Dangerous,
 and as the description of the Babysitter Bandit continues, they become
 increasingly frightened.  ``In a moment, we will show you a picture of the
 real Babysitter Bandit, Miss Lucille Botzcowski [pron.\ /botzokowsky/],
 and remember... she may be using a clever alias.''  A picture of Ms. Botz
 appears on the screen, and the kids scream.  Ms. Botz appears, carrying
 a length of rope.  Bart and Lisa scream,
 ``Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa-
 aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa-
 aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!''  Thunder roars outside.

 [End of Act Two.  Time: 13:23]

 The kids make a run for it.  Bart ducks into the basement.  Lisa skids
 (cartoon style) into the kitchen and grabs the phone.  But she gets a
 busy signal.  Meanwhile, Homer and Marge are on the highway looking for
 Ye Olde Offramp Inn.  They spot it, but miss the exit.  ``No problemo,''
 says Homer.  ``We'll just get off at the next exit.''  A sign reads,
 ``Next Exit 34 Miles.''

 Ms. Botz descends into the basement looking for Bart.  While searching,
 she finds a cabinet of pickled beets and helps herself.  Atop the
 cabinet is Bart and a bowling ball.  Bart tries to roll the ball onto
 Ms. Botz, but he loses his balance and falls.
   
   Seeing as no one was hurt, I think it would be really silly to dwell on this.
   -- Bart to The Babysitter Bandit, after a failed capture attempt,
      ``''
   
 Meanwhile, Lisa hides under the kitchen table and finally gets through.
 As she talks, she is dragged by the phone cord out from under the table.
 By Ms. Botz.  Oops.

 Homer carries Marge across the threshold, stumbles, and trips, tossing
 Marge (``Wheeeee!!'') onto the waterbed, where she relaxes, while Homer
 rubs his knee.

 Back at home, Ms. Botz has finished tying up Bart and Lisa...
   
   Bart: We know who you are, Ms. Botz.  Or should I say, Ms. Botzcowski.
         You're the Babysitter Bandit.
   Ms.B: You're a smart young man, Bart.  I hope you're smart enough to keep
         your mouth shut.
   Lisa: He isn't.
   -- A little knowledge, ``''
   
 ... disables the phones, tapes Bart's mouth shut, and leaves them on the
 couch to suffer through The Happy Little Elves.  Bart protests, but Lisa
 says, ``Quiet, Bart!  Let's make the best of this.''

 At the motel, Marge offers to go ``slip into something more comfortable'',
 and Homer hopes it's the blue thing with the... things.

 Maggie wakes up and grabs the mobile above her crib, which she uses as a
 trapeze, landing in a pile of stuffed animals.  She spots Ms. Botz in the
 hallway, relieving the closet of its valuables (and some unvaluables).
 Maggie then wanders downstairs and spots her elder siblings, as well as
 the Happy Little Elves.  She decides to watch the Elves.

 The movie ends, and Maggie tries to turn off the TV with the remote control.
 Lisa asks, ``Wanna watch the Happy Little Elves again?''  Maggie nods.
 ``But ya hafta untie me, first.''  Maggie does so.

 ``Oh... Homer...'' calls Marge seductively.  She's indeed wearing the blue
 thing with the... things.  Homer gives one of his lustful, ``Ohhhhh...''s.

 Ms. Botz continues her pillaging and spots Maggie walking through the
 hallway.  She follows the sound of the sucking, which leads her into
 a dark room.  (*whump*)  The lights come on.  Bart (sucking on Maggie's
 pacifier) has clobbered her with a baseball bat.

 Homer and Marge relax in the waterbed, and Marge decides to check up on
 things at home.  There is no answer because Bart, Lisa, and Maggie
 (clutching Bart's neck like a knapsack) have escaped out the window.
 The kids call from a pay phone.  (Bart goes down on all fours so Lisa
 can stand on his back to reach the phone.)
   
   Operator: Hello, vigilant viewer.  How may we help you?
   Lisa: We caught her!  We caught the Babysitter Bandit!  She's tied up
         at our house right now!
   Bart: Ask if there's a reward.
   Lisa: Is there a reward? ... [to Bart] If she's convicted, we get T-shirts.
   Bart: Yeah!
   -- Calling America's Most Armed and Dangerous, ``''
   
 Homer and Marge return home to find Ms. Botz bound and gagged, being forced
 to watch, yes, The Happy Little Elves.  Homer and Marge untie her and
 apologize profusely.  Ms. Botz's first words:  ``Please turn off the TV.''

 Homer helps Ms. Botz with her luggage (``Oh, these things are heavy!'')
 and pays her triple the rate, just so there are no hard feelings.
   
   Ms.Botz: Mr. Samson, can I give you a bit of advice?
   Homer:   Sure.
   Ms.Botz: Don't turn your back on that boy for a second.
   -- Words of warning from the Babysitter Bandit, ``''
   
 Ms. Botz speeds off just before Homer is surrounded by police cars.
 Bart explains that they left her tied up in the house, but Homer snags
 him and scolds, ``I just had to untie your babysitter and pay her off
 so that...''  Microphones are shoved in his face.  A reporter asks,
 ``Are you telling the world that you just aided and abetted the escape
 of the notorious Babysitter Bandit?''  Homer fumbles, ``Actually, it
 was quite a struggle!''

 Homer and Marge watch the news.  The caption reads, ``Homer Simpson,
 local boob.''  TV-Homer says, ``Have you ever seen a kung-fu movie?
 It was just like that!''

 Homer shuts off the TV.
   
   Homer: Lord help me, I'm just not that bright.
   Marge: Oh, Homer, don't say that.  The way I see it, you raised three
          children who could knock out and hog-tie a perfect stranger,
          you must be doing &lt;something&gt; right.
   -- ``''
   
 Homer thinks...  ``Yeah!'' and the two kiss as Marge turns off the lights.
 Homer asks, ``Can we make up again?''   Responds Marge, ``Oh, my goodness!''

 EPISODE TITLE: Bart Gets an F


EPISODE SUMMARY: 

   

 Springfield Elementary School.  Martin completes his book report, titled
 ``An Afternoon With Ernest Hemingway:  Reflections by Martin'', complete
 with beard and fishing pole props.  Ms. Krabappel gushes in admiration.
 Bart slips a packet on Martin's seat.  ``A little ketchup for your buns,
 Papa?''  (*splort*)  Next up is Bart.
   
   Fellow students, prepare to be dazzled!  [walks to the front of the room]
   Well, as Mrs. Krabappel already mentioned, the name of the book that I
   read was &lt;Treasure Island&gt;.  It's about these... [describing the book jacket]
   pirates.  Pirates... with patches over their eyes...  and...  shiny gold
   teeth... and green birds on their shoulders...  [pause]
   Did I mention this book was written by a guy named Robert Lewis Stevenson?
   And published by the good people at McGraw Hill.  So, in conclusion,
   on the Simpson scale of one to ten, ten being the highest, one being
   the lowest, and five being average, I give this book... a nine.
   Any questions?   [hands go up]   Nope?  Then I'll just sit down.
   -- Bart's book report, ``''
   
 Ms. Krabappel asks Bart if he actually read the book.
   
   Mrs. Krabappel, I am insulted.  Is this a book report or a witch hunt?
   -- Bart takes offence when Mrs.K accuses him of not reading the book
      he is doing a report on, ``''
   
 She challenges him to tell the class the name of the pirate.
 Bart thinks frantically to himself... ``Blackbeard... Captain Nemo...
 Captain Hook...  Long John Silver... Pegleg Pete... Bluebeard...''
 He guesses Bluebeard.  He guesses wrong.

 After class...
   
   I will not fake my way through life.
   -- Bart's blackboard punishment, ``''
   
   Ms. K: Your grades have gotten steadily worse since the beginning of the term.
          Are you aware of that?
   Bart:  Yes, ma'am.
   Ms. K: Are you aware that there is a major exam tomorrow on colonial America?
   Bart:  Yes, ma'am.
   Ms. K: Blah blah, blah-blah.  Blah blah blah blah blah?
   Bart:  Yes, ma'am.
   Ms. K: Blah blah.  Blah-blah blah, blah blah blah.
   Bart:  Yes, ma'am.
   Ms. K: Bart!  You haven't been paying attention to a word I said, have you.
   Bart:  Yes, ma'am.
   Ms. K: Well, then what did I say?
   Bart:  Uhhhhhh... Straighten up and fly right?
   Ms. K: Pah!  That was a lucky guess.
   -- Yes, ma'am, ``''
   
 At the Noiseland Video Arcade, Bart plays (and loses) ``Escape from Grandma's
 House''.  Bart resolves, ``A couple more games, then I'll hit the books.''
 He goes to the change machine and changes a $10 bill.

 Bart (sipping a soda), Lisa and Maggie watch Itchy and Scratchy.  The episode
 has a French Revolutionary theme.  Marge calls the family to dinner.  Homer
 rushes in before the icky skin forms on the soup.  Bart resolves, ``Right
 after dinner, it's down to business.''

 At dinner...
   
   Homer: Marge, could you get me another beer, please.
   Marge: Just a second, Homer.  Lisa has some good news.
   Lisa:  He doesn't care, Mom.
   Homer: Sure I do!  I just want to have a beer while I'm caring.
   -- It's like walking and chewing gum, ``''
   
 Lisa got an A on her vocabulary test.  Homer proudly tapes the test to the
 refrigerator, among the other vocabulary tests on the door, covering a crude
 drawing labelled ``Cat'', drawn by Bart.  Homer decides to pick up that beer
 while he's there.

 Homer remembers that it's Big Gorilla Week on Million Dollar Movie.  Bart
 tries to go study, but Homer yanks him into the living room.  Homer and
 Bart watch ``Gorilla the Conqueror'' together.  ``Oh, well, maybe just
 one more hour.''  The movie ends with the gorilla, in a cage, set adrift
 at sea.  Homer sobs, ``It's so unfair...  Just because he's different.''
 Bart leaves for his room to study.

 Bart enthusiastically cracks open his history book.  He tries reading
 but dozes off.
   
   Homer: Pssst.  Marge, come take a look at this.
          [Bart has fallen asleep at his desk]
   Marge: Oh... the little tiger tries so hard.
          Why does he keep failing?
   Homer: Just a little dim, I guess.
   -- Like father, like son, ``''
   
 Homer and Marge put Bart to bed.

 Bart wakes up the next morning.  ``Uh-oh.''

 Bart takes an open textbook on the bus...
   
   Bart: [reading his history book while boarding the bus]
   Otto: Hey, Bart-dude!  Whoa, you look freaked!
   Bart: Hey, Otto-man.  I got a big test today I am &lt;not&gt; ready for.
         Could you please crash the bus or something?
   Otto: Oh-ho, sorry, little buddy.  Can't do it on purpose.
         But, hey!  Maybe you'll get lucky!
   -- ``''
   
 Bart decides to find a seat next to an egghead, pump him for some answers,
 and ``boom, back on Easy Street''.  He selects Sherry and Terry.  But
 they see him coming and have a surprise in store.
   
   Bart:   Good morning, girls!
   Sherry+Terry:  Good morning, Bart!
   Bart:   Say... Who's up for a little cram session?  I'll go first.
           What was the name of the Pilgrims' boat?
   Sherry: The Spirit of St. Louis.
   Bart:   [taking notes]  And where'd they land?
   Terry:  Sunny Acapulco.
   Bart:   And why'd they leave England?
   Sherry: Giant rats.
   Bart:   Cool!  History's coming alive!
   -- ``''
   
 The girls giggle.  Martin overhears the conversation.

 As Bart gets off the bus, Martin (though he's not sure why he's doing it)
 warns Bart that the answers the girls gave him were wrong.  ``A blindfolded
 chimp with a pencil in his teeth has a better chance of passing this test
 than you do.''

 In class...
   
   Ms. K: All right, class, take one and pass the rest back.  [hands out exams]
   Bart:  [to himself]  Think, Simpson, think.  Crisis brings out the best in you.
          [convulses and collapses on the floor, moaning]
   Ms. K: Ugh.  What is it, Bart.
   Bart:  [climbing back to his seat]  Nothing... Must... take... test...
          [falls back to the floor]
   -- Bart the Thespian, ``''
   
 Bart leaves the classroom clutching his stomach.  He dances through the
 hallway, then resumes his histrionics when he reaches the nurse's office.
 The nurse is on the floor picking up a dropped jar of tongue depressors.
   
   Nurse: [concerned]  What's the matter, son?
   Bart:  [clutching his stomach]  Sharp, stabbing pains... in my stomach.
   Nurse: Oh dear, I've heard of this... [consults a medical reference book,
          opens to the page ``Amoria Phlebitis'']
          Do you feel a shooting pain in your arm?
   Bart:  [waving his arms]  Both arms, ma'am.
   Nurse: Temporary loss of vision?
   Bart:  [blindly]  Huh?  Who said that?  Come closer...
   -- Live from the Improv, ``''
   
 In his bed, Bart finishes another bowl and rings a bell.  Marge comes in,
 and Bart asks for another dish of double-capuccino chocolate-fudge.  Marge
 is pleased that Bart seems to be recovering, since this is his third bowl.
 Marge asks if there's anything else, and Bart asks for the TV set.
 Marge calls downstairs to Homer (who is watching a gorilla movie),
 ``Bring the television up.  Bart's got his vision back!''
   
   I wish &lt;I&gt; had Amoria Phlebitis...
   -- Homer, ``''
   
 Lisa and Maggie join Bart.
   
   Lisa:  Everyone knows you're faking it, Bart.
   Bart:  Well, everyone better keep their mouth shut.
   -- ``''
   
 Bart calls Milhouse to get the answers to the exam.

 Bart hums through the exam.  Ms. Krabappel grades it on the spot.
 ``This test is worse than Milhouse's exam!''  This is the final straw.

 Homer and Marge join Bart in the classroom.
   
   Ms. K: Mr. and Mrs. Simpson, I think you know our district psychiatrist
          Dr. J. Loren Pryor.
   Homer: Hey, Dr. J.
   Dr. J: [ahem]  I think we have on our hands here a classic case of what
          laymen refer to as fear of failure.  As a result Bart is an
          underachiever and yet he seems to be... How shall I put this...
          proud of it?
   Homer: Hmmm.
   Dr. J: One of his problems may be his short attention span which can lead
          to blah blah blah blah...
   Homer: Uh-huh.
   Dr. J: Blah blah blah, blah blah blah...
   Homer: Mmmm...
   -- Bart is close to failing fourth grade, ``''
   
 Unlike the other students in the class, Bart has not shown any improvement
 over the semester.  Indeed, his grades have gotten worse.  Bart cracks.
 ``Okay, okay!  Why are we dancing around the obvious?  I know it, you know
 it.  I am &lt;dumb&gt;, okay?  Dumb as a post!  Think I'm happy about it?''
 Dr. Pryor reluctantly recommends that Bart be held back.  Bart protest,
 but Marge suggests it might not be so bad.  Bart continues his protests.
   
   Look at my eyes!  See the sincerity?  See the conviction?  See the fear?
   -- Bart learns he might be held back a grade, ``''
   
   As God as my witness, I can pass the fourth grade!
   -- Bart, ``''
   
 Adds Homer, ``And if you don't, at least you'll be bigger than the
 other kids.''

 [End of Act One.  Time: 9:33]  (Wow, a long one.)
   
   Otto: Get off the bus or forever hold your peace, little dudes!
   Bart: Otto, you know I respect you.  I mean, you always let us throw
         stuff at cars and try to tip the bus on sharp turns.
   Otto: Heh, damn thing never goes over, does it?  [unintelligible
         `ga-hah' noise]  So what's in your head, little man?
   Bart: Well, I've been failing a lot of tests recently.
   Otto: Yeah huh...
   Bart: And, now they're talking about holding me back in the fourth grade
         if I don't shape up.
   Otto: That's it?  Hey, relax, man!  It could end up being the best thing
         that ever happened to ya.  I got held back in the fourth grade myself,
         twice!  Look at me, man!  Now I &lt;drive&gt; the school bus!
   -- ``''
   
 Bart trudges into school.

 In class, the phrase ``repeat the fourth grade'' echos through Bart's head
 as he slips into a daydream.  An elderly Ms. Krabappel asks an adult Bart,
 ``What was the pirate's name in &lt;Treasure Island&gt;?''  Bart responds, ``Look,
 lady.  I got a peptic ulcer, my wife's hocking me for a new car, and I need
 a root canal.  Willya quit buggin' me about the stupid pirate!'' Bart, Jr.
 whispers the answer to his father, but Ms. Krabappel catches him and asks
 to see them both after class.

 Bart wakes up when a baseball bounces off his forehead.  The ball rolls
 over near Martin, who is seated under a tree reading.  When Martin throws
 the ball like a girl, the other kids laugh.  Martin returns to the
 forecastle of the Pequod.  Bart gets an idea.  He asks Martin to help him
 pass.
   
   Bart:   I can make it so the other kids don't laugh at you so much.
   Martin: They... laugh at me?  I've always considered myself rather popular.
   Bart:   You're not.  Watch.  [pushes Martin down, crowd laughs]
   Martin: But... but my speed with numbers... [Bart helps Martin to his feet]
           my years of service as a hall monitor, my prize-winning dioramas?
           These things mean nothing to them?
   Bart:   Perhaps another demonstration.  [pushes him down again, more laughs]
   -- ``''
   
 Martin gets the point.  Asks Bart, ``Then it's Adil?''  Martin agrees.

 First order of business is to inspect Bart's study area.  Bart shows Martin
 to his room.  ``There's a desk under that junk over there.''  Martin says
 the room must be cleaned, and some ferns added.
   
   No study area is complete without adequate plant life.
   -- Martin, ``''
   
 Bart and Martin get on the school bus.
   
   Martin: [takes a seat at the front of the bus]
   Bart:   No!
   Martin: No?
   Bart:   Only geeks sit in the front seat.  From now on, you sit in the
           back row.  And that's &lt;not&gt; just on the bus, it goes for school and
           church, too.
   Martin: Why?
   Bart:   [mezzo voce]  So no one can see what you're doing!
   Martin: Ooooh.. I think I understand... [grabs pencil, starts writing]
           the potential for mischief varies inversely with one's proximity
           to the authority figure!   [Shows his equation to Bart:
           \math M \propto 1/P \math]
   Bart:   Well, yeah, but don't say it like that...
   -- Bart helps Martin shed his poindexter image, ``''
   
 Bart pops a wheelie on his bicycle.  He then removes the basket from
 Martin's bicycle, and Martin rides out of frame.  (*crash*)

 Martin adds a fern to Bart's shiny-clean room.

 Bart teaches Martin how to shoot a slingshot, but the rubber band snaps
 back in Martin's face.

 Martin and Bart sit under a tree, reading a comic book and a history
 book, respectively.  Inside Bart's book is a comic book; inside Martin's
 comic book is a textbook.  Each looks at the other's book.

 Bart finishes a ``Duh!''\ graffito and hands the spray can to Martin.
 Martin produces an elegant mural of Ms. Krabappel at her desk.  Bart
 slaps his forehead.

 Bart teaches Martin how to make funny faces.

 Martin watches while Bart reads a book, highlighter pen in hand.
   
   Pretty soon, you will be ready to try it with a &lt;real&gt; book!
   -- Martin watches Bart with a highlighter pen and a `book', ``''
   
 Milhouse, Lewis, Richard, Bart and Martin stop for breath after pulling
 some unseen prank.
   
   Who would have ever thought that pushing a boy into the girl's lavatory
   could be such a thrill!  The screams!  The humiliation!  The fact that
   it wasn't me!
   -- Martin joins Bart and friends, ``''
   
 Bart reminds Martin about the history test, but Martin is too busy
 having fun.  ``Life's too short for tests!''  Martin leads the other
 boys (except for Bart) to the arcade.

 In his room, Bart doodles in his textbook.  Marge pops in and reminds
 Bart that it's past his bedtime.  Bart reluctantly closes the book.
 ``This is hopeless.''
   
   Bart: [praying] Well, old timer, I guess this is the end of the road.  I know
         I haven't always been a good kid, but, if I have to go to school
         tomorrow, I'll fail the test and be held back.  I just need one more
         day to study, Lord.  I need Your help!
   Lisa: [watching] Prayer... the last refuge of a scoundrel.
   Bart: A teachers strike, a power failure, a blizzard... Anything that'll
         cancel school tomorrow.  I know it's asking a lot, but if anyone can do
         it, You can!  Thanking You in advance, Your pal, Bart Simpson.
   -- ``''
   
 Bart turns off the light.  Outside, snow begins to fall.  A chorus sings
 ``Hallelujah!''

 [End of Act Two.  Time: 15:00]

 Marge wakes Bart, who dreads the day.  But Marge shows him the snow outside,
 and Bart yells, ``Good morning, world!''  He takes the banister express
 downstairs and joins the rest of the family listening intently to the radio.
 Homer celebrates the closing of the nuclear power plant.  Next, the school
 closings.  And yes, Springfield County schools are closed.

 Kids rush out of their houses to enjoy the snow, followed futility by
 their respective mothers being motherly.
   
   Bart:  [running towards door with sled; goggles on head] Cowabunga!
   Marge: Remember to take a break if your arms go numb!
   Bart:  [rushes for the front door.  Lisa's ominous shadow blocks the way]  Hey!
   Lisa:  I heard you last night, Bart.  You prayed for this.  Now your
          prayers have been answered.  I'm no theologian; I don't know who or
          what God is exactly, all I know is He's a force more powerful than Mom
          and Dad put together, and you owe Him big.  [shuts the door]
   Bart:  You're right.  [removes goggles, hands them to Lisa]
          I asked for a miracle, and I got it.  I gotta study, man!
          [goes upstairs to his room]
          I'm not missing anything... frozen earlobes, trudging up that
          stupid sledhill over and over again... How good could it be?
          [looks out window...]
   -- ``''
   
 Outside, kids have a snowball fight.  Milhouse takes a ride on a sled.
 Kids build a snow fort.  Marge takes the girls out ice skating.
 Also on the ice are Ms. Krabappel and Principal Skinner, playing
 hockey.  Says Ms. K, ``I haven't had this much fun in years!''
 Monty Burns walks past in period clothes, and a stray snowball knocks
 off his top hat.  Homer chuckles from behind a wall.  Monty is a good
 sport about it.
   
   Burns:    I was never one to back away from a snowball fight!
             Smithers, you may fire at will!
   Smithers: Certainly, sir.
   -- Snow Day, ``''
   
 Smithers pegs Homer in the noggin.

 A band plays.  Diamond Joe Quimby speaks.
   
   I hereby declare this day to be Snow Day, the funnest day in the history of
   Springfield!
   -- Diamond Joe Quimby, ``''
   
 People hold hands and sing carols.

 Bart peels his face away from the window and goes into the basement.
 He reads about the First Continental Congress.  Bart envisions himself
 seated among the delegates.
   
   Th. Jefferson: We hold these truths to be self-evident...
   Bart: [to himself] We hold these truths to be self-evident...
         We hold these truths to be self-evident...
   Th. Jefferson: That all men are created equal.
   Bart: [to himself]  That all men are created equal...
   Th. Jefferson: And from that equal creation they derive rights inherent
          and inalienable...
   Delegate: [glances out the window, points]
          Hey, look, everybody!  It's snowing!
   Delegate: In the middle of July?
   Al. Hamilton:  It's a miracle!
   Ben Franklin: [comes in, shakes snow off his wig]
         Fellas, I've invented something fun!  The sled!
         [all the delegates (except Bart) rush outside to play]
   Delegate: [o.s.] Hey, look everybody!
         John Hancock's writing his name in the snow!
   -- Trying to study during a snow day, ``''
   
 Bart shuts the textbook in horror.  He stares at his chewed pencil.
   
   You wanna be held back a grade?  Concentrate, man!
   -- Bart, slapping himself, trying to study, ``''
   
 Through the cellar window, the rest of the family watch Bart slap himself.

 (*slap*)  Bart slaps himself in class after the exam is over.  Martin
 calmly turns in his test, dressed in a Hawaiian shirt and wearing shades.
 Bart answers the final few questions as Ms. Krabappel asks him to turn
 in his exam.  She pulls out `Old Red' and grades the exam as Bart watches
 sadly, cringing at every X-mark.  Bart got a 59, another F.  Bart can't
 believe it.  Neither can Ms. Krabappel.  ``Another year together.  Ugh,
 it's going to be hell.''  Bart stares at his exam and cries.  Ms. Krabappel
 doesn't understand, ``I figure you'd be used to failing by now.''  Bart
 explains that he really tried this time, but it was no use.  Ms. Krabappel
 tries to reassure him, ``Well, a 59 is a &lt;high&gt; F...''  Bart complains,
 ``Now I know how George Washington felt when he surrendered Fort Necessity
 to the French in 1754!''  Ms. Krabappel is shocked.  She looks up the
 reference and announces, ``My God, Bart, you're right!''  She rewards
 him with an extra point on his exam, bringing him up to a D-.
   
   Bart:  I... passed?
   Ms. K: Just barely!
   Bart:  Gasp!  I passed!  I got a D-!  I passed!  [crying tears of joy]
          All right!  [kisses Ms. Krabappel and dances out of the classroom]
          I passed, I passed, I passed, I passed!  I got a D-!  I passed!
          [showing off his exam to anyone and everyone]
          I got a D-!  I passed!  I got a D-!  I passed!
          I passed!  I... ... ... kissed the teacher!  Yuck!  Ptuu!  Ick!
   -- Bart rejoices when he passes his test, ``''
   
 Homer tapes Bart's test on the refrigerator.
   
   Homer: We're proud of you, boy!
   Bart:  Thanks Dad.  But part of this D minus belongs to God...

   Smithers: Our first issue, sir, is our low productivity and record high
             worker accident rate.
   Burns:    [expels breath]  Any suggestions?
   Advisor1: A round of layoffs might wake up the idiots.

 Homer's tartar sauce solution seems to have worked...

 When Homer becomes Burns' `favorite', Smithers gets mad and throws the
 handtowel to the floor.  (Upon which a man quickly dashes out, picks
 it up, and backs away, somewhat like a tennis ballboy.)  At night, Smithers
 sneaks into the files and finds Homer's phony medical insurance form.

 some of it for a rainy day.  ``Rainy day?  There's never going to be

 [Apparently, the Simpsons rainy day has come.]  Smithers informs Homer
 that he's been fired, but Karl takes the fall.  Homer is at a loss
 and watches Karl leave in the rain.  When Karl realizes Homer forgot
 his umbrella, he gives Homer his.  While Homer panics on the drive home,
 Bart dreams of having a beard and splashes the Dimoxinil on his face.

 EPISODE TITLE: Treehouse of Horror


EPISODE SUMMARY: 

   

 On a stage, Marge pops out from behind a curtain.
   
   Hello, everyone.  You know, Hallowe'en is a very strange holiday.  Personally,
   I don't understand it.  Mm mm...  Kids worshipping ghosts, pretending to be
   devils.  Oooh, things on TV that are &lt;completely&gt; inappropriate for younger
   viewers.  Things like the following half hour.  Nothing seems to bother &lt;my&gt;
   kids. But tonight's show, which I totally wash my hands of, is really scary.
   So if you have sensitive children, maybe you should tuck them into bed
   early tonight instead of writing us angry letters tomorrow.  Thanks for
   your attention.
   -- Marge's disclaimer, ``''
   
 ``The Simpsons Halloween Special''.  Thunderstorm.  Pan across Springfield
 Cemetery...  Push in on the Simpsons' home, panning upward to the treehouse,
 where Lisa's distinctive hairstyle can be seen in the window.  Down below,
 a sheeted ghost approaches.  It's Homer, carrying a bag of treats.
   
   Ooh, what a haul this year.  I &lt;love&gt; Hallowe'en!
   -- Homer returns from a night of trick-or-treating, ``''
   
 He spots the light on in the treehouse and investigates.

 Inside, Lisa holds a flashlight to her face and concludes telling her
 scary story to Bart and Maggie.  Bart is hardly impressed and says it
 wasn't scary.  After a brief ``Is not!''/``Is too!'' argument, Lisa
 hands Bart the flashlight and tells him to give it his best shot.
 ``Here's a story that's reeeeeeeeeeeeally scarifying.''  (``Oh, brother.'')

==============================================================================
 The mover finishes moving the Simpsons' stuff into their new mansion;
 Bart and Lisa set to unpacking.  Homer tips the moving man a dollar.
 He grumbles, ``I'm glad there's a curse on this place,'' on his way out.
 Marge wonder why they were able to buy the house for so little.
   
   Prime location, eighteen bedrooms, moat...
   -- Marge admires the family's new mansion,
      ``Bad Dream House'' in ``''
   
 Meanwhile, Bart unpacks.  He removes a book and sets it down, which
 mysteriously floats into the air and goes back into the box.  Bart removes
 the same book and sets it down, etc.  Another book propels itself across
 the room, hitting Lisa.  Lisa accuses Bart of throwing the book.
   
   House: Geeettt ooouuuttt...
   Marge: What on earth was that?
   Homer: Probably just the house settling.
   -- The Simpsons buy a haunted house,
      ``Bad Dream House'' in ``''
   
 Marge carries pots and pans into the kitchen, which is dripping with blood.
   
   Mm...  This kitchen &lt;certainly&gt; could use a woman's touch.
   -- Marge discovers a blood-covered kitchen in their new home,
      ``Bad Dream House'' in ``''
   
 She discovers a swirling hole in the wall and calls Homer in.
   
   Lisa:  It looks like a vortex.  A gateway into another dimension.
   Homer: Oooh, a vortex.  [takes an orange and tosses it in]  Catch!
          [the orange disappears with a pop]
          Heeeeey!  Pretty slick!
          [a crumpled-up piece of paper comes back]
   Lisa:  [reads the message]  ``Quit throwing your garbage into our dimension.''
   -- ``Bad Dream House'' in ``''
   
   Quit throwing your garbage into our dimension.
   -- A message from the beyond, ``Bad Dream House'' in ``''
   
 A cry for help is heard from the living room, where the family discover
 Bart and Maggie suspended in midair, assorted objects flying about.
 Homer pulls Bart down.  ``Okay, boy.  Let's see you talk your way out
 of &lt;this&gt; one!''  Lisa shivers with fear.
   
   Lisa:  I can feel an evil presence in this house.
   Marge: Evil!?
   Homer: Quiet, Lisa.  You're scaring your mother.
   -- First things first, ``Bad Dream House'' in ``''
   
 Marge tells the kids to get their coats; they're leaving right now.
 The kids' coats magically float into their arms.
   
   It's only natural there be &lt;some&gt; things wrong with an old house like this.
   It's a fixer-upper!
   -- Homer explains the family's new (haunted) house,
      ``Bad Dream House'' in ``''
   
 ``We get a bunch of priests in here...''  As Homer defends his position,
 he floats into the air.  Then falls twenty feet to the floor.  Marge
 reluctantly agrees to sleep on it.  (The idea, not the floor.)

 That evening...
   
   House: They are all against you, Bart... You must kill them all...
          They all must die...
   Bart:  Are you my conscience?
   House: I... [pause] ... Yes, I am.
   -- A conversation with the... ``Bad Dream House'' in ``''
   
 Meanwhile, the house tells Lisa, ``Lisa... The butcher knife, Lisa...''
 Lisa takes a butcher knife out of her drawer.  (``Weird kid,'' observes
 Chris Baird @{cjb}.)  She tests its sharpness and grins evilly.

 In his bedroom, Homer wields an axe.  ``They are all against me...  They
 all must die...''  In her crib, Maggie sits up, and her head spins around.
 In the kitchen, Marge reaches for a serrated bread knife...

 Homer wanders into the kitchen, followed by Bart (cleaver), Lisa (butcher
 knife), and Maggie (paring knife).  Maggie holds the knife between her
 teeth.  The four march in a circle, laughing maniacally.  In the kitchen,
 Marge lowers her knife...

 To spread mayonnaise on a sandwich.  She emerges into the living room
 and asks, ``What's going on out here!''  Everyone apologizes to each
 other.  (Maggie sucks apologetically.)
   
   This family's had its differences, and we've squabbled,
   but we never had knife fights before.
   -- Marge, after the infamous knife scene,
      ``Bad Dream House'' in ``''
   
 Lisa opens the door to the cellar and discovers...
   
   Lisa: It's an ancient Indian burial ground...
   Bart: Man, this place has got everything!
   -- ``Bad Dream House'' in ``''
   
 Homer angrily dials the phone.
   
   Mr. Bloot?  Homer Simpson here.  When you sold me this house, you forgot to
   mention one little thing:  YOU DIDN'T TELL ME IT WAS BUILT ON AN INDIAN BURIAL
   GROUND!  ...   NO YOU DIDN'T!  ...  Well, that's not &lt;my&gt; recollection. ...
   Yeah?  Well, all right, goodbye!  [angrily hangs up]  He said he mentioned
   it five or six times.
   -- Homer, ``Bad Dream House'' in ``''
   
 Marge is about to leave.
   
   You will diiiiieeeee.  You will die slowwwwwwwly.
   Your stomach will swelllllllll, your intestines will wriiiithe and booooil.
   Your eeeeeyes will buuuuurst.  And some horrible stuuuuuuuff, possibly
   your braiiiiin, will start coming out through your noooooooose.
   -- A house that knows how to get its point across,
      ``Bad Dream House'' in ``''
   
 Marge finally blows up and gives the house a good tongue-lashing.  She
 then catches herself.  ``My hands are shaking!''  Homer consoles her,
 ``Better than your eyes bursting.  Ugh.''
   
   Bart:  Do it again!
   House: What?
   Bart:  Make the walls bleed.
   House: No!
   Bart:  Hey, man, we own you.  Let's see some blood!
   House: I don't have to entertain &lt;you&gt;.
   Bart:  Come on, man, do it.  Do the blood thing.  Come on, do it.
          Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it!
   -- Bart talks to the ... ``Bad Dream House'' in ``''
   
 Meanwhile, Lisa takes a more sensitive approach.  The house whines,
 ``Leave me alone...''  Marge steps in, ``Don't talk to her like that.''
 The house rejoinds, ``Hey, listen, lady!''  Marge tells the house that
 that will have to learn to live together.  The house asks to think about
 it, and the family step outside.
   
   Hm... Life with the Simpsons.  What choice do I have?  [self-destructs]
   -- The House, ``Bad Dream House'' in ``''
   
 The house folds in on itself and explodes.
   
   Bitchin'!
   -- Bart watches the house self-destruct,
      ``Bad Dream House'' in ``''
   
   It chose to destroy itself rather than live with us.  One can't help but
   feel a little rejected.
   -- Lisa, ``Bad Dream House'' in ``''
   
 The family trudge down the street.

 [End of Act One]

 Lisa is unimpressed, so Bart decides to show her...  ``This severed finger!''
 He opens a matchbook, revealing a severed finger.  (Insert scary music.)
 Maggie removes her pacifier and sucks on the finger.  Bart quickly discards
 the matchbox.  (``Ewww!  Baby spit!'')

 ``That was just a warm-up for this mock-a-bree tale which I call...''

==============================================================================
 The Simpsons are having a barbecue on the back patio.  Homer turns on the bug
 zapper, then empties an entire can of lighter fluid into the grill.  ``That
 should just about do it.''  He tosses in a match.  FOOM!  A mushroom cloud
 forms over the Simpsons house.

 Lisa is the first to spot a flying saucer hovering over the backyard.  All
 investigate.  (Homer eats a hamburger.)  A shaft of orange light descends
 and lifts one by one the members of the family into the saucer.  (Though
 it has considerable difficulty lifting Homer.)

 A drooling, green, octopus-like alien introduces himself.
   
   Alien: Greetings.  I am Kang.  Do not be frightened.  We mean you no harm.
   Marge: You, you speak English.
   Alien: I am actually speaking Rigelian.  By an astonishing coincidence,
          both of our languages are exactly the same.
   -- The Simpsons are abducted by aliens,
      ``Hungry Are the Damned'' in ``''
   
 Kang explains, ``Kodos and I are taking you to Rigel IV, a world of
 infinite delights to tantalize your senses and challenge your intellectual
 limitations.''
   
   Look, I know that to you, we Simpsons are a lower order of life.
   We face that prejudice every day of our lives...
   -- Lisa pleads for mercy from the aliens,
      ``Hungry Are the Damned'' in ``''
   
 But her plea is interrupted by a buffet cart.  ``Take all you want, but
 eat all you take.''  For Lisa, fried shrimp.  For Bart, Sloppy Joe's.
 For Homer, pork chops.  And for Marge...
   
   Radish rosettes!  These are hard to make.  They're a very advanced race.
   -- Marge admires the aliens' food,
      ``Hungry Are the Damned'' in ``''
   
 Kang, drooling, invites them to ``grow large with food.''  Lisa suspects
 something isn't quite right, and Homer agrees.  He orders applesauce.
   
   Alien: [drooling] Your wife is quite a... dish.
   Homer: Oooh, thanks.
   -- ``Hungry Are the Damned'' in ``''
   
 The family are shown to the entertainment center.
   
   Alien: On this cable system, we receive over one million channels from the
          furthest reaches of the galaxy.
   Bart:  Do you get HBO?
   Alien: No, that would cost extra.
   -- Showing the flying saucer's entertainment center,
      ``Hungry Are the Damned'' in ``''
   
 Next, Kang shows the family video pong.  The family scoff.
   
   Alien 1: Anyone from a species that has mastered intergalactic travel
            raise your hand.  [raises his tentacle]
   Alien 2: [raises his tentacle]
   Bart:    [raises his hand]
   Homer:   [slaps Bart's hand]
   Alien 1: All right, then.
   Marge:   I'm sorry. Your game is very nice.
   -- After the Simpsons chuckle at the `Pong' video game on the UFO,
      ``Hungry Are the Damned'' in ``''
   
 Dinner is announced.  Lisa asks why the aliens never eat, and they explain
 that they are saving their appetite for a great feast that awaits them on
 Rigel IV.  Marge asks if they're invited.  Kang answers, ``You'll be at the
 feast.  I have a feeling you'll be the Guests of Honor...''  The aliens
 chuckle.  Homer asks for more details, but Kodos explains, ``When we arrive,
 there will be plenty of time to chew the fat...''  Lisa doesn't touch her
 food.

 While the aliens weigh Bart and Homer, Lisa explores.  She discovers the
 cook reaching for a spice rack.  ``This will give the humans the perfect
 flavor...''  He licks his lips and carries off the pot.  Lisa looks at the
 cookbook:  ``How to Cook Humans.''

 She rushes back to the dining room and shows the family her discovery.
   
   Nobody, but NOBODY eats the Simpsons!
   -- Homer, ``Hungry Are the Damned'' in ``''
   
 (Homer's face is smeared with barbecue sauce.)  Kodos takes the book and
 blows off the dust.  The real title is ``How to Cook &lt;for&gt; Humans.''
 Lisa blows off more dust:  ``How to Cook &lt;Forty&gt; Humans.''  Kodos blows
 off yet more dust.  The full title reads ``How to Cook &lt;for&gt; Forty Humans.''
 The aliens are shocked and hurt that the Simpsons thought they were going
 to eat them.  (``Frankly, you people made pigs of yourselves.'') Serak the
 Preparer cries.

 The flying saucer returns the Simpsons to their backyard.
   
   Alien: We offered you paradise.  You would have experienced emotions
          a hundred times greater than what you call love.  And a thousand
          times greater than what you call fun.  You would have been treated
          like gods and lived forever in beauty.  But, now, because of your
          distrustful nature, that can never be.
   Marge: [aside] Mmmm.  For a superior race, they really rub it in.
   -- ``Hungry Are the Damned'' in ``''
   
 Lisa poetically observes, ``There &lt;were&gt; monsters on that ship, and truly
 we were them.''
   
   Lisa, see what we mean when we say you're too smart for your own good?
   -- Marge, after Lisa ruins things yet again,
      ``Hungry Are the Damned'' in ``''
   
 Bart chimes in, ``Way to go, Lis.''  Homer adds, ``Yeah, thanks, Lisa.''

 [End of Act Two]

 In the treehouse, Lisa reads a book.  Bart chokes himself, trying to get
 her attention.  Lisa is reading ``a classic tale of terror by Edgar Allan
 Poe.''  Bart suspiciously observes that she's reading a school book.
 ``Don't worry, you won't learn anything.  It's called...''

 As Lisa reads, the scene changes to a scary mansion.

   
   Lisa:     Once upon a midnight dreary,[...]

 Homer sits, asleep, with a book titled ``Forgotten Lore Vol.~II'' on his
 lap.

 When the tapping occurs in the next stanza, Homer wakes up with a start and
 looks around nervously.
   
   Narrator: While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
             As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door --
   Homer:    "'Tis some visiter,"
   Narrator:                      I muttered,
   Homer:                                     "tapping at my chamber door --
                                                    Only this and nothing more."
   Bart:     Are we scared yet?
   -- Lines 3-6 of ``The Raven'' in ``''
   
 Homer returns to sleep.
   
   Narrator: Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;
             And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.
             Eagerly I wished the morrow; -- vainly I had sought to borrow
             From my books surcease of sorrow --
   -- Lines 7-10 of ``The Raven'' in ``''
   
 Homer wakes up and walks to a tall portrait of Lenore (Marge), her hair
 going up so far that it requires a second panel.
   
   Narrator:                                     sorrow for the lost Lenore --
   Homer:    [plaintively]  Oh, Lenore...
   Narrator: For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore --
                                                    Nameless here for evermore.
   -- Lines 10-12 of ``The Raven'' in ``''
   
 A rustle is heard outside.  Homer screams and hides behind the chair.
   
   Narrator: And the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain
             Thrilled me -- filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;
             So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating,
   -- Lines 13-15 of ``The Raven'' in ``''
   
 Homer hides under the chair.
   
   Homer:    "'Tis some visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door --
                                                    This it is and nothing more."
   -- Lines 16,18 (17 omitted) of ``The Raven'' in ``''
   
   Narrator: Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,
   Homer:    "Sir,"
   Narrator:        said I,
   Homer:                   "or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;
             But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,
             And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,
             That I scarce was sure I heard you "
   Narrator:                                      -- here I opened wide the door; ----
   Homer:    [throws open the door and covers his eyes]
   Bart:     [impatiently]  This better be good.
   Homer:    [peeks through his fingers]
   Narrator:                                        Darkness there and nothing more.
   Homer:    Huh?
   -- Lines 19-24 of ``The Raven'' in ``''
   
 Sitting outside the treehouse is Homer, clearly scared.  Bart complains,
 ``You know what would have been scarier than nothing?''  ``What?''
 ``ANYTHING!''
   
   Narrator: Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,
             Soon again I heard a tapping something&lt;1&gt; louder than before.
   Homer:    "Surely,"
   Narrator:           said I,
   Homer:                      "surely that is something at my window lattice;
             Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore -- ["]
   -- Lines 31-34 of ``The Raven'' in ``''

 Homer opens the window.
   
   Narrator: Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,
             In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore;
   -- Lines 37-38 of ``The Raven'' in ``''
   
 The raven bears a striking resemblance to Bart.
   
   Narrator: Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;
             But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door --
             Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door --
                                              Perched, and sat, and nothing more.
   -- Lines 39-42 of ``The Raven'' in ``''
   
 Homer chuckles.
   
   Homer:    "Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou," 
   Narrator:                                               I said,
   Homer:                                                      "art sure no craven,
             Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore --
             Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!"
   Narrator:                                        Quoth the Raven 
   Bart/Raven:                                                      Eat my shorts!
   -- lines 45-48 of ``The Raven'' in ``''
   
 Lisa tells Bart that the Raven says ``Nevermore'' and nothing else.
 Bart reluctantly gives in.

 An odor wanders past, and Homer catches a whiff of it.
   
   Narrator: Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed by some&lt;2&gt; unseen censer
   -- line 81 of ``The Raven'' in ``''
   
 The `unseen' censer whaps Homer upside the head.  (``D'oh!'')
   
   Narrator: Swung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.
   -- line 82 of ``The Raven'' in ``''
   
 The seraphim in question are an angelic Lisa and Maggie.
   
   Homer:    "Wretch,"
   Narrator:           I cried,
   Homer:                       "thy God hath lent thee -- by these angels he hath sent thee
             &lt;3&gt;respite and nepenthe, from thy memories of Lenore;["]
   -- lines 83-84 of ``The Raven'' in ``''
   

 Homer orates before the portrait of Lenore.
   
   Homer:  ["] Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!"
   Narrator:                                           Quoth the Raven
   Bart/Raven:                                                         "Nevermore."
   Homer:    D'oh!
   -- lines 85-86 of ``The Raven'' in ``''
   
 Homer is really angry now.
   
   Homer:    "Be that word our sign of&lt;4&gt; parting, bird or fiend!"
   Narrator:                                                             I shrieked, upstarting --
   Homer:    "Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore!
             Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul has&lt;5&gt; spoken!
             Leave my loneliness unbroken! -- quit the bust above my door!
             Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!"
   Narrator:                                           Quoth the Raven
   Bart/Raven:                                                         "Nevermore."
   Homer:    [trying to stay calm]
          ["]Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!"
   Narrator:                                           Quoth the Raven
   Bart/Raven:                                                         "Nevermore."
   Homer:    Why you little...!
   Bart/Raven: Uh-oh!
   -- lines 99-104 of ``The Raven'' in ``''
   
 Homer lunges for the Raven, who flits off.  Homer chases the bird across
 and around the room, but it remains barely out of reach.
   
   Homer:    Come back here, you little Raven!
   -- An incidental moment of ``The Raven'' in ``''
   
 Homer's chase makes a mess of his chamber.
   
   Homer:    D'ah, grf, son-of-a, d'oh!
   -- An incidental moment of ``The Raven'' in ``''
   
 Homer throws a potted plant at the Raven, who dodges the projectile.  In
 true cartoon fashion, the plant hits Homer on the head.  Tiny Ravens dance
 around Homer's head, chanting, ``Nevermore, Nevermore, Nevermore...''

 The chase continues.  The Raven plucks books from the shelf and drops them.

 The Raven has returned to its place atop the bust of Pallas.  Below lies
 the carnage it has wrought upon the room.
   
   Narrator: And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting
             On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;
             And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming,
             And the lamp-light o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;
             And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor
                                                     Shall be lifted -- nevermore!
   -- lines 105-110 of ``The Raven'' in ``''
   
 Notes:

 &lt;1&gt; Original says ``somewhat'', not ``something''.
 &lt;2&gt; Original says ``from an'' not ``by some''
 &lt;3&gt; Original has ``Respite -- '' at the beginning of the line
 &lt;4&gt; Original says ``in'' not ``of''
 &lt;5&gt; Original says ``hath'' not ``has''

 The Raven chuckles evilly.

 Fade back to the treehouse.
   
   Bart: Lisa, that wasn't scary.  Not even for a poem.
   Lisa: Well it was written in 1845.  Maybe people were easier to
         scare back then.
   Bart: Oh, yeah.  Like when you look at ``Friday the Thirteenth, Part 1''.
         Pretty tame by today's standards.
   -- Lisa reads ``The Raven'', ``''
   
 Marge calls the kids to bed, and Bart brags that he won't have any trouble
 falling asleep tonight.  As the kids descend, we see Homer sitting outside
 the treehouse, shivering.

 Maggie, Lisa, and Bart all sleep soundly in their respective rooms.  Homer
 begs Marge not to turn off the light, with no success.  Through the window,
 he sees the Bart/Raven, which chuckles before flying away.  ``Oh, I hate
 Hallowe'en.''

 EPISODE TITLE: Two Cars in Every Garage, Three Eyes on Every Fish


EPISODE SUMMARY: 

   

 A tranquil scene by the lake.  Lisa and Bart are fishing.  A car pulls up.
   
   Reporter: Ah.  So, kids, caught anything?
   Lisa:     Not yet, sir.
   Reporter: Uh huh.  Uh, what are you using for bait?
   Lisa:     My brother's using worms, but I, who feel the tranquility
             far outweighs the actual catching of fish, am using nothing.
   Reporter: I see.  And what's your name, son?
   Bart:     I'm Bart Simpson.  Who the hell are you?
   Reporter: Heh heh.  I'm Dave Shutton.  I'm an investigative reporter who's
             on the road a lot and, uh, I must say that in my day, we didn't
             talk that way to our elders.
   Bart:     Well, this is my day, and we do, sir.
             [catches something on the line, with appropriate `Hulp!' noises]
             All right!  We eat tonight!
   -- ``''
   
 But there is something strangely peculiar about the fish Bart catches.
 It has one, two, three eyes.  In the distance looms the twin cooling
 towers of the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant.

   Marge:  Well, leave it to good ol' Mary Bailey to finally step in
           and do something about that hideous genetic mutation.
   Homer:  [snort] Mary Bailey.  Well, if I was governor, I'd sure find
           better things to do with my time.
   Marge:  Like what?
   Homer:  Like getting Washington's Birthday and Lincoln's Birthday
           back as separate paid holidays.  `President's Day' [blows a
           raspberry] What a rip-off!  I bust my butt day in and day out...
   Marge:  You're late for work, Homer.
   Homer:  So?  Someone'll punch in for me.
   Lisa:   Try not to spill anything, Dad.
   Bart:   Keep those mutants comin', Homer!
   Homer:  [sotto voce] I'll mutant you...

 A drop of glowing green goo burns a hole through the
 inspector's clipboard.  ``Yeah, well, that's always been like that.''
   
   Homer:  [wakes with a start]  Aa!  [twiddling levers wildly]
           Uh, just resting my eyes!
   Burns:  Ah, well-done.  A rested employee is a vigilant employee.
   -- The nuclear power plant inspection,
      ``''
   
 The inspectors stand in knee-deep glowing green water.

 The chief inspector is taken to Burns' office.
   
   Inspector:  Mr. Burns, in twenty years, I have never seen such a shoddy,
               deplorable...
   Burns:      Oh, look!  Some ... careless person has left thousands and
               thousands of dollars just lying here on my ... coffee table.
               Uh, Smithers, why don't we leave the room, and hopefully, when 
               we return, the pile of money will be gone.
               [leaves, waits, then returns]
               Ooh.  Look Smithers, the money and a very stupid man are
               still here.
   Inspector:  Burns, if I didn't know better, I'd think you were trying
               to bribe me.
   Burns:      Is there some confusion about this?
               [thrusting the money into the inspector's pockets]
               Take it!  Take it!  Take it, you poor schmo!
   -- The nuclear power plant fails inspection,

 The inspector presents Burns with a list of 342 violations.
   
   Burns:    How much could it possibly cost to fix this place up?
   Smithers: Approximately fifty-six million dollars, sir.
   Burns:    Fifty-six million!
   Smithers: [cowering] Don't hit me, sir.
   -- The nuclear power plant fails inspection,
      ``''
   
 Burns sends Smithers out, then hits the bottle.  Time passes from 5:00 to
 9:30, and Burns is obviously drunk.  He sings ``Brother, Can You Spare
 a Dime'' as he trudges down the empty corridors.  Burns tosses the empty
 bottle aside with a clatter.

 The noise wakes Homer, asleep at his post.  Realizing the lateness of the
 hour, Homer phones home.  ``Sorry I didn't call, but it's been a madhouse
 here!''  In the parking lot, Homer hears Monty Burns' voice singing
 from his luxury car.  He peeks into the window, and the two are startled by
 each other.  Monty invites Homer in...
   
   Ooh!  Cushy!
   -- Homer sits in Monty Burns' car,
      ``''
   
 ... and explains his predicament.  Homer
 recalls how he was talking to Marge about how &lt;he&gt; would run things if
 he were governor...
   
   Burns: Do you realize how much it costs to run for office?
          More than any honest many could afford!
   Homer: I bet &lt;you&gt; could afford it, though.
   -- ``''
   
 Monty likes the idea.  He drives off.  ``Where are we going, sir?''
 ``To create a new and better world.''  ``If it's on the way, could you
 drop me off at my house?''

 [End of Act One.]
   
   Marge: Homer, we're a Mary Bailey family.
   Homer: Mary Bailey isn't going to fire me if I don't vote for her.
   -- ``''
   
   Ooh, a political discussion at our table.  I feel like a Kennedy!
   -- Lisa, ``''
   
 Marge can't see how a despicable man like Monty Burns has a chance
 against Mary Bailey, ``the most belov\'ed governor our great state has
 ever known.''

 Monty Burns has called a meeting.
   
   Now, here's the problem as I see it.
   While Governor Bailey is belov\'ed by all,
   ninety-eight percent of the voters rate you as despicable or worse.

   Burns:   Why are my teeth showing like that?
   Advisor: Because you're smiling!

 The advisor continues by introducing the other half of his team:  The
 people whose job it is to turn public sentiment against Mary Bailey.
 ``Ah, visual aids help so much.''  The first order of business is to
 neutralize the fish story.

 Grampa Simpson and friends watch television.
   
   Thank you for watching `Movie for a Dreary Afternoon'.

 Coming next is a paid political announcement.  Neither Abe nor Jasper
 is willing to get up to change the channel, so they suffer through it.
   
   An election!?  That's one of those deals where they close the bars, isn't
   it?
   -- Barney, ``''
   
   Marge:  I wonder if he's going to say anything about that horrible fish.
   Homer:  Oh, Marge.  What's the big deal?
           I bet before the papers blew this out of proportion,
           you didn't even know how many eyes a fish had.

 He shows a fishbowl containing a three-eyed fish, named Blinky,
 and assures the television audience that nothing is wrong.
   
   But don't take &lt;my&gt; word for it.

 Another absurd analogy later, Monty concludes...
   
   This fish is a miracle of nature.  With a taste that can't be beat.

              from some guy who dated her when she was 16.
   Burns:     Ah.  And?
   Advisor 2: He, uh, he felt her up.
   Burns:     Bah!  Not good enough!

 Monty Burns gives a fiery speech.
   
   Bart:   Is your boss governor yet?
   Homer:  Not yet, son, not yet.
   -- ``''
   
 The headlines read, ``Burns nukes Bailey in latest poll''.
   
   Advisor: The voters now see you as imperial and god-like.
   Burns:   Hot dog!
   Advisor: But there's a down-side to it.
            The latest polls indicate you're in danger of losing touch with
            the common man.
   Burns:   Oh, dear!  Heaven forfend!
   -- Burns runs for governor,
      ``''
   
 The night before the election, he should dine with one of his employees.
 The advisors survey the security monitors in search for ``somebody
 common enough.''  They see Homer eating a donut, scratching his butt,
 and belching.  Burns concedes, ``Well, I knew there would be sacrifices...''

 [End of Act Two.]
   
   Homer: Oh!  Great toast, Marge!
          Oh, by the way, the night before the election, Mr. Burns is
          coming over for dinner.
   Marge: What!?
   Homer: Oh, and some reporters and a camera crew, but you don't have to
          feed them.
   Bart:  Cool, man!  A media circus!
   Marge: Absolutely not!
   Homer: Come on, Marge!
   Marge: Mm mm.  I'm going to be ringing doorbells for Mary Bailey that night.
   Homer: D'oh!  Kids, pleases leave the room.  I don't want you to see this.
   Bart:  Uh-oh.  [Bart, Lisa, and Maggie zip away]
   Homer: [on his knees] Please please please please please please please
          please please please...

 The campaign crew plaster the Simpsons house with Burns posters.
 (Even taking down the family portrait to make room.)
   
   Advisor: Little girl, do you think you can memorize this by dinnertime
            tomorrow?
   Lisa:    ``Mr. Burns:  your campaign seems to have the momentum of a runaway
             freight train.  Why are you so popular?''
   Advisor: Very good.
   Lisa:    Mm.  Well, as long as I'm asking something, can I ask him to
            assuage my fears that he's contaminating the planet in a manner
            that may one day render it uninhabitable?
   Advisor: No, dear.  The card question'll be fine.
   Marge:   Well, I think the non-card question is a valid...
   Homer:   Marge! ... Don't worry.  My daughter's very bright, and I'm sure
            she'll be able to memorize your question by dinnertime tomorrow.

   Mr. Burns wants you to appear veeeery affectionate towards him.

 That evening in bed, Homer tries to snuggle up to Marge, who keeps
 sliding away, until she falls onto the floor.
   
   Homer: Marge, get back in bed.
   Marge: [on the floor] No, I'm just fine right here.
   Homer: What's wrong?  I just want to snuggle.
   Marge: I don't feel like snuggling.
   Homer: What's that got to do with it?
   -- Apparently, not much,
      ``''
   
 Marge explains that she doesn't want to snuggle with someone who doesn't
 let her express herself.  Homer explains that she &lt;does&gt; express herself,
 through her housework and cooking.  Marge takes to the idea, to Homer's
 bemusement.

 It's media circus time.  The latest polls show a dead heat.
 The guest of honor arrives, and is promptly bowled over by SLH.
   
   Bad dog!  Bad... neighbor dog!
   -- Homer, ``''
   
 He picks himself up, then is knocked down by Snowball II.

 The family and Burns are seated at the dinner table.  The advisor tells
 Monty that the way he handled the pet incident has put him over the top.
 Homer invites Bart to say Grace.
   
   Dear God:  We paid for all this stuff ourselves, so thanks for nothing.
   -- Bart says Grace, ``''
   
 Monty quickly covers.  The family dig into their green glop (presumably
 a salad) in a decidedly vulgar manner as Homer asks the prepared question.
 Monty pretends the question was unexpected, then answers it in dramatic
 fashion.  As Marge clears away the dishes, Lisa reluctantly asks her
 question, then leaves before Monty has finished answering it.  Lisa joins
 Marge in the kitchen to mope.
   
   Lisa, you're learning many valuable lessons tonight. and
   one of them is to always give your mother the benefit of the doubt.
   -- Marge, ``''
   
 Marge carries the entree to the table:  It's fish.  Three-eyed.
 Monty reluctantly hands over his plate, and Marge serves him the head.
 Burns reluctantly takes a forkful, chews, then spits it out.
 The piece of fish flies across the room.  Cameras flash furiously,
 and the media leave, all before the fish hits the floor.

 Within minutes, word is out, and Monty's campaign is ruined.
 His advisors throw in the towel.
   
   YOU CAN'T DO THIS TO ME!  I'M CHARLES MONTGOMERY BURNS!

   Burns:    [smashes some pictures]  [tries to overturn a table, but can't]

   Smithers: Yes, sir. [does so]
   -- A friend in need, ``''
   
 Homer tries to intervene, but Burns snaps back, `Shut up and wreck
 something!''  So Homer smashes a flowerpot.  Lisa asks what the destruction
 is going to accomplish, and Burns concedes the point.
   
   Burns: This anonymous clan of slack-jawed troglodytes has cost me the
          election, and yet if I were to have them killed, I would be the one
          to go to jail. That's democracy for you.
   Smithers: You are noble and poetic in defeat, sir.
   -- ``''
   
 ``Simpson, I shall make it the focus of my remaining years that your
 dreams will go unfulfilled.''
   
   Homer: Oh.  My dreams will go unfulfilled?  Oh, no!  I don't like
          the sound of that one bit.  That means I have nothing
          to hope for.  Marge, make it better please, can't
          you make it better, huh?
   Marge: Homer, when a man's biggest dreams include seconds on
          dessert, occasional snuggling and sleeping in til noon on
          weekends, no one man can destroy them.
   Homer: Hey, you did it! [big smooch] [snuggling occurs and credits go up]

 EPISODE TITLE: Dancin' Homer


EPISODE SUMMARY: 

   

 At Moe's Tavern, the gang beg Homer to tell his story...
   
   Homer:  There's only one thing worse than being a loser.  It's being one
           of those guys who sits in a bar telling a story of how he became
           a loser, and I never want that to happen to me.
   Barney: Please, Homer?
   Moe:    Yeah, come on, Homer.
   Homer:  Well, okay.
   -- Homer becomes one of those guys who sits in a bar telling a story of
      how he became a loser, ``''
   
 The story begins at `Nuclear Plant Employees, Spouses, and No More
 Than Three Children Night', at Springfield War Memorial Stadium to
 watch the local minor-league team, the Springfield Isotopes, known
 as the 'Topes to its fans...
   
   [police sirens wail in the distance]                                    \\
   Heh, I think we lost 'em.  Hey, and we're at the ballpark!  Awright!
   Two birds with one stone!
   -- Otto drives the bus to the ballpark, ``''
   
 pull back to see the huge set of skid marks leading up to the bus.
 Heading into the stadium...
   
   Homer: You know, boy, some of the players you see tonight may make it
          to the big leagues someday.
   Bart:  What?  Aren't we going to see any washed-up major-leaguers?
   Homer: Sure!  We get a nice mix here.
   -- At the ballpark to watch the local minor league team, ``''
   
 Lisa looks forward to seeing poetry in motion, but Homer looks forward
 to the 72-ounce tubs of beer.
   
   Marge: Last year you got a little rambunctious and mooned the poor umpire.
   Homer: Marge, this ticket doesn't just give me a seat, it also gives me the
          right, no, the duty! to make a complete ass of myself.
   Marge: Mph.
   -- At the ballpark to watch the local minor league team, ``''
   
 At the gate, Mr. Burns greets each family as it arrives.
   
   Burns: Ah, the Gammels.  Good to see you.
   Mr.G.: You're an inspiration to all of us in waste management, sir.
   Burns: Well, take your mind off contaminants for one night and have a hot dog!
          [laughs]
   -- Out of the frying pan... ``''
   
   Burns: Ah, well, if it isn't the Simps!
   Homer: Uh, it's Simp-son, sir.
   Burns: Eh?  [refers to the index card] Oh, yes.  Homer and Marge Simpson.
          Oh, and these must be Bart, Lisa, and uh, `expecting'.
   -- At Nuclear Plant Employees, Spouses, and No More Than Three Children Night
      ``''
   
 At the stadium, Flash Baylor doesn't sign a baseball for Bart, so
 Marge angrily takes the ball and approaches him.  She returns with the
 ball...
   
   Marge: Here you go, Bart.
   Bart:  [reads the inscription]  Springfield Kozy Kourt Motel, Room 26,
          How about it? -- Flash.
   Homer: Wow!  Flash Baylor came onto my wife!  You've still got the magic,
          Marge.
   -- Marge gets a baseball autographed, ``''
   
 Homer appears on `Jumbo-Vision', and is embarrassed to find that his
 zipper is undone.
   
   Announcer: Ladies and gentlemen, throwing out tonight's first ball,
              the man whose name is synonymous with our nation's safest
              and cleanest energy source, Mr. Montgomery Burns!
              [isolated smatterings of applause]
   Smithers:  Oh, they love you, sir.
   -- At the ballpark, ``''
   
 Burns only manages to throw the ball two feet and is taunted by Homer,
 Bart, and even Lisa.  The National Anthem is sung by Bleeding Gums
 Murphy...
   
   Oooooooooooooooooooooh say.                                             \\
   Can you,                                                                \\
   I'm asking you,                                                         \\
   can you seeeeeeeeee                                                     \\
   byyyyyyyyyy the dawwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww...                               \\

   Aaand the rocket's red glaaaaaaaaaaare,                                 \\
   The bombs bursting, suit it on, pop and wail up in the aiiiiiiiiir...   \\
   [time passes]                                                           \\

   ... hooooooooome of theeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
       braaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaave.                                             \\
       [huge sigh of relief from crowd]
   -- The Star Spangled Banner, spangled by a star, ``''
   
 ... and Lisa is the one one who manages to stay awake for all of
 it.  The game between the Springfield Isotopes and the pesky Shelbyville
 Shelby-Villians begins, the 'Topes hoping to snap a record 26-game
 losing streak.  Burns is shown to his seat...
   
   Ah, sitting with the employees.  I guess this proves I'm their friend.
   Tsk, get me something on an aisle, Smithers, I don't want to be
   &lt;surrounded&gt; by them...
   -- Monty Burns joins his employees at the ball game, ``''
   
 ... which is right next to Homer.  The two smile nervously at each other.
 Homer bemoans his fate.  Burns orders a tub of beer for himself and
 Homer.
   
   Wait a minute, we're not having a drug test tomorrow, are we?
   -- Homer suspects a trap when Burns buys him a beer at the ball game,
      ``''
   
 The cost of two 72-ounce tubs is $2.50.  The game continues,
 and Homer and Burns join in taunting the players, and doing `the wave'
 (which looks pretty stupid with only two people).  It's now the bottom
 of the ninth.  One out, the bases are loaded, and the 'Topes are down
 by three.  The batter strikes out (``of course'').
   
   Big Bill McCloskey coming up.  As soon as he pops out, we'll go right to the
   post-game show.
   -- Dan Horde calls the game between the 'Topes and Shelbyville,
      ``''
   
 To the music of `Baby Elephant Walk', Homer dances on the dugout and
 fires up the crowd, to the embarrassment of his family.  (Lisa covers
 Maggie's eyes, as well as her own.)
   
   And I got up in front of them.  I felt an intoxication that had nothing to
   do with alcohol.  It was the intoxication of being a public spectacle!
   -- Homer narrates his story, ``''
   
 And it works.  McCloskey belts a homer out of the park to win the game.
 But Homer's antics earn him a `banned for life' stamp on his index card.
 In the parking lot, a shadowy figure approaches Homer.  It's Antoine
 Tex O'Hara, the owner, who hires Homer as the team's mascot.

 [End of Act One.  Time: 9:22] [pretty long]

 Homer is decked out in his goofy `' outfit and drags the
 family away from dinner to go to the game.
   
   Our lives have taken an odd turn.
   -- Lisa comments on Homer's goofy costume as... ``''
   
   Homer:     Don't fill up on those vegetables, kids.  Save room for your nachos!
   Lisa+Bart: All right!
   Marge:     [disapprovingly] Mmm.
   -- Homer takes the kids to the ballpark dressed as... ``''
   
 At the park, Homer is a hit.
   
   For the first time in my life, people weren't laughing at me,
   they were laughing &lt;towards&gt; me!
   -- Homer narrates his story, ``''
   
 The 'Topes win a second game, and Homer eventually gets top billing on
 the signage.
   
   A Simpson on a T-shirt.  I never thought I'd see the day...
   -- Marge reacts disapprovingly to Homer's likeness on a T-shirt,
      ``''
   
 Homer tries to cast a spell on an opposing player, and gets threatened.
 He asks the organist to play `Baby Elephant Walk' with a reggae beat.
 And two long-haired Caribbean types express their approval.  It's the
 bottom of the ninth, the bases are loaded, and there are two outs...
   
   S! P! R! I! N! G! F! E! E! L! D!!  Springfield!!!!!
   -- Homer spells out the town name while dressed as... ``''
   
 But it doesn't help; the 'Topes lose.  Homer is called to Tex's office
 and is informed that he's going to be promoted to the big leagues, to
 fill in for the Capital City Goofball a couple innings a night.
   
   Tex:   Why don't you talk it over with your family?
   Homer: Because they might say no.
   -- Homer learns he's being promoted to work for the Capital City team,
      ``''
   
   This was the biggest decision the Simpsons ever faced.
   I should've listened to the kids instead of my big, dumb wife.
   Oh, I shouldn't have called her that.
   Bite my tongue.  Bite my tongue.  Mmph.  Ow!
   -- Homer narrates his story, ``''
   
 He tells the family...
   
   Lisa:  I can't leave Springfield!
          I was born here and I thought I would die here!
   Homer: It won't be so bad.  You'll die someplace else.
   -- On moving to Capital City, ``''
   
 Bart fears losing his friends, but Homer says he'll make new ones.
   
   We're simple people with simple values.  Capital City is too big and
   too complex.  Everyone in Springfield knows us and has forgiven us.
   -- Lisa lists some reasons not to move to Capital City, ``''
   
 But Marge tells Homer that this may be his calling in life and he should
 go for it.  The kids are won over.
   
   Whatever doesn't kill me can only make me stronger!
   -- Lisa (quoting Nietzsche) agrees to move to Capital City, ``''
   
 Even Maggie raises her arms in triumph.  Homer asks his supervisor for
 a leave of absence.
   
   Sure, what would you like?  Four years?  Five years.
   -- Homer's supervisor grants him a leave of absence, ``''
   
 The family holds a yard sale, and Ned has trouble finding the right words...
   
   Ned:   I don't know how to say this, but uh...
   Homer: Oh, knock it off, Flanders; don't start blubbering on me.
          I'll miss you too... [aside] not.
   -- Homer prepares to move to Capital City, ``''
   
 In the treehouse, Bart and Milhouse seal their bond as `spit brothers'.
 (``Ewwww...'')
   
   Lisa:    I can't help but feel that if we had gotten to know each other
            better, my leaving would actually have meant something.
   Friends: Yeah.
   -- Lisa bids farewell to her classmates, ``''
   
 Marge bids farewell to her sisters, and Homer gives a tearful farewell
 speech to his fans at Homer Appreciation Night.

 [End of Act Two.  Time: 14:42]

 The car is packed, and the family drive to Capital City.  They arrive
 at night and are awed at being in the city.  They admire the sights...
   
   Kids, look!  Street crime!
   -- Homer drives the family through Capital City, ``''
   
 then check into the Come Back motel for the night.  Homer practices his
 spelling, but Marge tells him to come to bed.  ``We would talk about it
 always.  For the first time in our lives, Marge fell asleep before I did.''

 At the stadium, Homer goes in the ``Players-Mascots Entrance'', while
 Marge and the kids get their tickets for the players' wives section.
   
   Bart was strangely quiet.  Later, he explained he was confused by feelings
   of respect for me.  It wouldn't last.
   -- Homer narrates his story, ``''
   
 Homer talks to the Capital City Goofball (``If there's anything I can do
 for you, just squeeze the wheeze'' [squeezes his nose, which honks]),
 and learns he's going to be doing the fifth inning.
   
   Goof:  What exactly do you have planned for us?
   Homer: Well, I get up and dance, and I spell out the name of the city,
          all to the tune of `Baby Elephant Walk'.
   Goof:  Ah, Mancini.  The mascot's best friend.
   -- Homer and the Capital City Goofball plan their strategy, ``''
   
 On his way out, Goof bumps into a hanging lamp.
   
   Well, hello again, everybody.  Dave Glass talking at ya.
   We've got great weather here tonight, under the dome...
   -- Calling the baseball game, ``''
   
 Marge and the kids get seats in the upper-upper-upper-mezzanine, and it's
 not the players' wives section; it's the players' ex-wives section.
   
   Homer:  [narrating] I was too tense to enjoy the game.  Every ounce of
           concentration I possessed was focused on the task at hand.
   Vendor: Red hots!  Getcher red hots here!
   Homer:  Ooh, red hots!
   -- ``''
   
 The spotlight shines on Homer, who quickly scarfs down his hot dog and beer,
 then launches into his act.  But he's a total flop.  He is called into
 the owner's office, who fires him.  (``And for God's sake, put some clothes
 on.'')  The family wait depressed outside the ``players-mascot'' entrance,
 but they put up a good front for Homer when he comes out.
   
   Oh, what a family.  My wife and kids stood by me.  On the way home, I
   realized how little that helped...
   -- Homer narrates his story, ``''
   
 And that's the story.  Homer is amazed that everyone was hanging on his
 every word.  The bar denizens beg Homer to tell it again, and he agrees.
 ``I wonder why stories of degradation and humiliation make you more
 popular.''  Moe responds, ``I dunno.  They just do.''

 [End of Act Three.  Time: 20:27]

 Over the closing credits, Tony Bennett sings the `Capital City' song.

 Media coverage


 Daily Press - Hampton Roads Newport News VA, Nov. 16, 1990


Profuse thanks to Ken Miller for locating this article, written by
Terry Armour. I certainly hope Mr. Armour and his paper take no offense to me
passing along this newsworthy article.                                  \ddt

    {\bf Local baseball teams give inspiration to Simpsons}

    Fans of The Simpsons may have noticed an eerie local flavor in last
    Thursday's episode on the Fox Network.

    For those who didn't see the episode, Homer, the gruff but lovable
    patriarch of the Simpsons' household, was the mascot for the local minor
    league team.  His name was `Dancing Homer'.

    `Dancing Homer' was so good at the local minor-league stadium, he made the
    jump to the Major Leagues.  The major league team was owned by Dave
    Rosenfield, as in the Tidewater Tides general manager.  There were also
    references to Dave Glass, the Tides' former radio man, and there was a
    player on the minor-league team named Flash Bailey as in Lash Bailey,
    former Peninsula Pilot. \Note1

    It turns out the episode was written by Ken Levine, who for two years has
    done some radio work for the Tidewater Tides.\Note2  Levine is a former
    writer for the Emmy-award winning Cheers. \Note3

    According to Rosenfield, Levine hinted he would use Rosenfield's name in
    an upcoming episode. Later, Rosenfield was told to watch Thursday's
    episode.  His wife taped it for him.

    ``I had a bunch of calls on it,'' Rosenfield said. ``People saw it and
    thought it was interesting.  Funny thing about it is people always say,
    `Ordinarily I don't watch the Simpsons but I just happened to watch it
    Thursday.' ''

    Rosenfield was somewhat a bad guy in the episode.  He fired Homer Simpson.

    ``I haven't fired a mascot in my whole life, primarily because I haven't
    hired one,'' Rosenfield said with a grin. ``I only fire assistant general
    managers.''

    Rosenfield admitted he's not a big fan of The Simpsons, having now watched
    it just twice. Frankly, he doesn't find it funny. Rosenfield said he smiled
    once during the Thursday's episode. ``I know it's a very successful show
    and an awful lot of people like it,'' Rosenfield said. ``I'm just not one
    of them. I don't like The Simpsons.''
\eQ
Mr. Miller concludes, ``Mr Rosenfields' opinions about The Simpsons are fine
with me.  I don't like the Tidewater Tides.  So if you can believe what you
read in the newspaper, this is the story behind the baseball episode of The
Simpsons.''

\Note1 Actually, the character's name was Flash Baylor.

\Note2 Ken Levine is now the announcer for the Seattle Mariners.

\Note3 Ken Levine and David Isaacs always work together as a team.
       They wrote 28 `Cheers' episodes together, and earned two Emmy
       nominations for their work.  (They didn't win, though.)

\Note4 Oh, and by the way, the Tidewater Tides are the farm team for
       the New York Mets, if you cared.

The song was also performed during the closing credits, but our local
affiliate decided that hyping `Beverly Hills 90210' was more important
than hearing Tony Bennett.  Anyone care to check if there were any
new verses?

 The location of Capital City


Theron Stanford @{tws} notes...
\Q
Capital City seems to be a synthesis of a number of large American
metropolitan areas.  The ``crosstown bridge'' is a parody of SF/East Bay,
as well as perhaps NY.  Also, Capital City has two restaurants named
``The Penny Loafer'' and ``The `Original' Frenchie's''.  In Los Angeles,
there used to be a restaurant called ``The Brown Derby'' which indeed
was in the shape of a hat.  And there still is a hamburger stand on
Beverly and Rampart called ``The Original Tommy's''.  They have a number
of affiliated stands, as well as a few copycats such as ``Tom's Number 5'',
hence the epithet ``original''.
\eQ

 In the locker room @{dh}

    * The `Playdude' pin-up in one of the lockers.  (cf. [7[FG]02])
    * Pan shot of locker room shows one of the players placing a cake on
      the seat of another player (playing poker), who is about to sit down.
      Another player is placing a sharp object (tack?) under the seat of the
      player who's placing the cake under the other player, while yet another
      player is testing the flexibility of a towel behind that player.  Off
      camera, you hear the sound of a crack and a yelp.

 What happens on the field as Homer waits for his big break @{jdc}


The right fielder catches a foul pop up and lands right next to Homer.
Everyone runs out on the field for a fight (one guy pops up in the air).
The Goof Ball rides by on a bicycle.

 Antoine Tex O'Hara


Eric Jablow @{ej} points out:  For many years, New York's WABC-TV evening
news had a popular weatherman, Tex Antoine.  Tex had been around for 20
years or so, but he self-destructed in a gruesome way.  In the mid-70s,
his spot came up just after a report of a rape case.  Tex thereupon said
about the last story, ``Confucius says, `If rape be inevitable, just lie
back and enjoy it.' ''  This so-called joke got him first suspended, and
then fired.  [The incident was a major news story at the time.  Whether
this is an intentional reference or just a coincidence is still
unresolved. --rjc]

 Production notes


Dave Hall @{dh} notes that at the end of the story, the mugs are still
full of beer.  The reason is that the decision was made late in the
production process to use Homer's narration as a frame around the
entire story.  By then, it was too late to produce new animation for
the framing bits.  That's why the lip sync is off for all the narration
scenes except for the one at the very beginning.

 Random comments


Since this episode was a flashback, there is no inconsistency with
Mr. Burns having an outdated index card on the Simpsons, though it does
conflict with their banishment from all company outings in ``There's No
Disgrace Like Home''.  Apparently, Homer was forgiven after his mascot
escapades.

Homer and Burns drank three 72oz tubs, which comes out to 18 beers each,
3/4 of a case!  Burns must have set a world's record for blood alcohol
level since he only weighs about fifty pounds. @{ptb}

 EPISODE TITLE: Dead Putting Society


EPISODE SUMMARY: 

   

 Homer grouses about mowing the lawn.  ``Supposed to be the boy's job.''
 Marge reminds him that Bart is doing a science experiment.
   
   One o'clock.  Still just a potato.
   -- Bart's science project, ``''
   
 Ned suggests Homer use some time-release granules to get rid of the
 crabgrass.  Homer denies that he has any.  Ned points out a few patches,
 ``There.  There.  And there's a big patch over there.''
   
   There's nothing wrong with crabgrass.  It just has a bad name, that's all.
   Everyone would love it if it had a cute name like, eh, `elfgrass'.
   -- Homer defending crabgrass against Flanders, ``''
   
   Homer: Marge, where's the Duff!?!
   Marge: Ohh, uh, we're all out, Homer.
   Homer: D'oh!
   Marge: Would you like some fruit juice?
   Homer: Don't toy with me, woman!!
   -- Homer needs refreshment while mowing the lawn, ``''
   
 Ned invites Homer into the Rumpus Room for some of his beer.  Homer
 accepts.  ``I deserve a little break.''  Pull back to reveal that Homer
 has mowed about twenty square feet.

 Homer is awed by the beauty of Ned's Rumpus Room.  Maude comes in with
 a tray of club sandwiches for the guys.  Ned draws a beer from his very
 own tap.
   
   Ned:   Here's a tasty little lager that came all the way from Holland.
   Homer: Well, buggers can't be choosy.
   -- ``''
   
 Homer downs the mug and burps.  Todd comes in and thanks Ned for his help
 with his science project.  Homer drinks another beer as he watches the
 two engage in some typically Flanders-like conversation.
   
   Homer: All right, knock it off!
   Ned:   Knock what off, Simpson?
   Homer: You've been rubbing my nose in it since I got here!
          Your family is better than my family, your beer comes from &lt;farther&gt;
          away, than my beer, you and your son like each other, and your wife's
          &lt;butt&gt;...
   Ned:   [gasp!]
   Homed: ... is higher than my wife's butt!  You make me sick!
   Ned:   Simpson, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.  I hope you
          understand.
   Homer: I wouldn't stay on a bet! [finishes his beer, then leaves]
          [returns]  One for the road. [takes a club sandwich and leaves]
   -- a friendly visit to the Flanders rumpus room, ``''
   
 Homer tosses in bed.
   
   Homer: Lousy bragging know-it-all showoff...
   Marge: What exactly did he say?
   Homer: Get this.  He said, uh, he said...
          Well, it wasn't so much what he said; it was how he said it.
   Marge: Well, how did he say it?
   Homer: Well, he...
   Marge: Was he angry?
   Homer: No.
   Marge: Was he rude?
   Homer: Okay, okay, it wasn't how he said it, either.
   -- It's the thought that counts, ``''
   
 ``But the message was loud and clear:  Our family stinks.''
 Marge notes that Ned's been nothing but a perfect neighbor, and Homer
 latches onto the word `perfect' and decides to take a walk to calm down.

 Meanwhile, Ned also has difficulty sleeping.
   
   I drag him over here, he has a few beers...  You can't blame him for erupting.
   -- Ned Flanders, ``''
   
 Maude suggests she isn't the person Ned should be talking to.  So Ned
 calls Rev. Lovejoy.
   
   Mrs. Lovejoy: Honey, wake up.  Honey, it sounds like Ned Flanders is
                 having some sort of crisis.
   Rev. Lovejoy: Oh.  Probably stepped on a worm...
   -- Flanders calls in the middle of the night, ``''
   
   Ned:   I feel like I violated Matthew 19:19.
   Rev.L: Huh?
   Ned:   Love thy neighbor.
   Rev.L: Oh, Matthew &lt;nineteen&gt; nineteen, yeah, right, right.
   -- ``''
   
 Rev. Lovejoy suggests, ``A gentle answer turneth away wrath,'' then
 immediately hangs up.  Ned sits down and writes a letter.

 Ned slips the letter under the Simpsons front door, and is startled by
 Homer, returning from his walk.  Ned apologetically gives Homer the
 letter and leaves.  Homer reads it... and laughs.

 At the breakfast table...
   
   Homer: [reading Ned's letter]  ``You are my brother.''
   Homer+Lisa+Bart: [giggle]
   Homer: ``I love you.''
   Homer+Lisa+Bart: [laugh]
   Homer: ``And yet, I feel a great sadness...'' [tries to stifle a giggle]
          ``... in my bosom.''
   Homer+Lisa+Bart: [finally lose it and laugh uproariously]
   -- Reading Ned's letter of apology, ``''
   
 Marge scolds them for laughing and excuses herself into the next room,
 where she giggles, then returns.
   
   Read the `bosom' part again, Dad!
   -- Lisa, ``''
   
 Marge tries to restore order.
   
   Bosom.
   -- Bart, ``''
   
 Marge wishes that her family was as close as the Flanderses.  So Homer
 offers to take the family miniature golfing, followed by frosty chocolate
 milkshakes.
   
   Mm.  I &lt;was&gt; going to wash my hair...
   -- Marge, after Homer suggests the family go miniature golfing,
      ``''
   
   Lisa:  And I'm studying for the math fair.
          If I win, I'll bring home a brand new protractor.
   Homer: Too bad we don't live on a farm.
   -- Homer suggests the family go miniature golfing, ``''
   
 Homer takes Bart and Maggie.

 Homer putts the ball into the center hole... which deposits the ball in
 the parking lot.  A passing car kicks the ball down the street.
   
   Play it where it lays, Homer.
   -- Bart after Homer botches a putt, ``''
   
 Maggie wanders off and takes a free ride on the windmill.  Meanwhile,
 Homer struggles with a mechanical ape obstacle.
   
   Give up homeboy, there's a six stroke limit.
   -- Bart after Homer botches a putt, ``''
   
 The ball goes up the ramp... bangs off the ape's opening-and-closing
 mouth... and returns to the tee.  Homer hops angrily.  Ned and Todd
 stop by.
   
   Todd: Hi Bart!
   Bart: Get bent.
   -- friendly greetings at the miniature golf course, ``''
   
   Ned:   Oh say, you look like you were having a little trouble there.
   Homer: That shot is impossible!  Jack Nicholson himself couldn't make it!
   -- at the miniature golf course, ``''
   
 Todd suggests playing more conservatively.  Go around, rather than through
 the obstacle, ``setting yourself up for an easy deuce.''  Todd does so,
 and manages to get a hole-in-one.

 They reach Ye End of Course.
   
   Bart:  Final score.  Bart, forty-one.  Homer... let's see...
          six plus six plus six plus six plus six plus...
   Homer: Never mind!
   -- leaving the miniature golf course, ``''
   
 They spot a sign for a miniature golf tournament.
   
   Todd:  Wow!  First prize fifty dollars!
   Bart:  Wow!  Free balloons for everyone who enters!
   -- A matter of perspective, ``''
   
   Ned:   So, my little Bartly, thinking of entering the tournament?
   Homer: Yeah, he's entering.
          And what's more, he's going to win, aren't you, boy?
   Bart:  I guess it's possible...
   Ned:   Hey hey, I like that confidence.
   -- ``''
   
 Ned notes that Todd is a rather good player.
   
   Oh yeah?  Well I think the fruit of my loins can beat the fruit of your loins
   any day of the week!  C'mon boy!
   -- Homer tells off Flanders, ``''
   
 At the soda fountain.
   
   Bart:   But Dad!  I've never won anything in my life!
   Homer:  Son, this is the only time I'm ever gonna say this.  It is &lt;not&gt;
           okay to lose!
   -- The ghost of Vince Lombardi? ``''
   
 [End of Act One.  Time: 8:59]
   
   Keep your head down, follow through. [Bart putts and misses]
   Okay, that didn't work.  This time, move your head and don't follow through.
   -- Homer giving putting advice, ``''
   
 Marge and Lisa watch disapprovingly from the house.

 Practice over, Bart returns to his room and tosses his putter carelessly
 aside.
   
   Homer: What are you doing!  That putter is to you what a bat is
          to a baseball player!  What a violin is... to the... the guy that...
          the violin guy!  Now c'mon!  Give your putter a name.
   Bart:  What?
   Homer: C'mon, give it a name.
   Bart:  Mister Putter.
   Homer: D'oh...  You wanna try a little harder son?  C'mon give it a girl's
          name.
   Bart:  Mom.
   Homer: Your putter's name is Charlene!
   Bart:  Why?
   Homer: It just is, that's why!  Now this, is a picture of your enemy,
          Todd Flanders.  Every day, I want you to spend fifteen minutes
          staring at it.  And concentrating on how much you hate him, and how
          glorious it will be when you and Charlene annihilate him!
   Bart:  Who's Charlene?
   Homer: [raises the putter, about to wallop Bart with it]
          I'll show you who Charlene is!  Now start hating!
   Bart:  Grrrrrrrr... rrrrrrrrrrrrr!!!!!!  [loses enthusiasm]
   -- a pep talk, ``''
   
 Todd says hello from his room.

 Homer raids the fridge.
   
   Marge: Homer, I couldn't help overhearing you warp Bart's mind.
   Homer: And?
   -- ``''
   
   Marge: I'm worried that you're making too big a deal of this silly little
          kiddie golf tournament.
   Homer: But Marge, but this is our big chance to show up the Flandereses. [sic]
   Marge: Well, I'm sure it is, but why do we want to do that?
   Homer: Because sometimes the only way you can feel good about yourself is by
          making someone else look bad.  And I'm tired of making other people feel
          good about themselves!
   -- Marge concerned over Homer's tactics, ``''
   
 Bart surveys his less-than-impressive awards shelf.
   
   Bart: Hey Lis, whaddya call those guys in chess that don't matter.
   Lisa: Well, a blockaded bishop is of little value, but I think you're
         referring to a pawn.
   Bart: Right.  I am a pawn.
   Lisa: Hmm... I know.  It's times like this that I'm thankful Dad has little
         to no interest in almost everything I do.
         Bart, I think I can help you.
   -- Lisa offers some sisterly advice, ``''
   
 ``Our journey begins here at the library.''  She greets everyone, then

   Bart: Lisa, we can't afford all these books!
   Lisa: Bart, we're just gonna borrow them.
   Bart: Oh... heh, heh... gotcha!  [wink]
   -- in the library, ``''
   
 As haunting music plays, Bart and Lisa sit in the lotus position
 alongside a lake.
   
   Lisa: I want you to shut off the logical part of your mind.
   Bart: Okay.
   Lisa: Embrace nothingness.
   Bart: You got it.
   Lisa: Become like an uncarved stone.
   Bart: Done.
   Lisa: Bart, you're just pretending to know what I'm talking about!
   Bart: True.
   Lisa: Well, it's very frustrating!
   Bart: I'll bet.
   -- ``''
   
 Lisa and Bart sit atop a mountain.
   
   Lisa: What is the sound of one hand clapping?
   Bart: Piece of cake.  [claps with one hand]
   Lisa: No, Bart, it's a 3000-year-old riddle with no anwer.
         It's supposed to clear your mind of conscious thought.
   Bart: No answer?  Lisa, listen up!  [claps with one hand]
   -- Solving unsolved problems, ``''
   
 Lisa tries again.
   
   Lisa: If a tree falls in the woods and no one's around, does it make a sound?
   Bart: Absolutely!  [makes the sound of a tree falling]
   Lisa: But Bart, how can sound exist if there's no one there to hear it.
   Bart: Wooooooo...
   Lisa: [hands Bart his putter] It is time.
   -- Bart finally gets it, ``''
   
 At the miniature golf course, Lisa takes out a measuring tape.
   
   Lisa: The basis of this game seems to be simple geometry.  All you have
         to do is hit the ball... here.
         [Tap] [Clunk-clunk] [Clunk-clunk] [Duh-dunk]
   Bart: I can't believe it.
         You've actually found a practical use for geometry!
   -- at the miniature golf course, ``''
   
 Bart sinks several more putts.  Lisa holds an umbrella over Bart as he
 putts.  The course rained out, they practice on a pool table.  Back at
 the course, Bart sinks a putt blindfolded and standing on one leg.
 Bart poses on the garbage can in the backyard.  Homer tells him to stop
 before the neighbors see, but too late.  Ned asks what's up, and Homer
 promises that Bart will mop the floor with Todd's butt.
   
   Ned:   May the best man win.
   Homer: ``May the best man win.''  The mating call of the loser!
   -- From one who should know, ``''
   
 Homer dares Ned to bet on the outcome, so Ned offers to wager one of Maude's
 wind chimes against a batch of Marge's blueberry muffins.  Homer asks Ned
 to make a ``real'' bet and makes chicken sounds for quite a long time.
   
   Simpson, you're starting to annoy me.
   -- Ned Flanders, ``''
   
 Yelling at the top of their lungs, the two agree to make the father of the
 loser mow the winner's lawn in his wife's Sunday dress.  Marge reluctantly
 draws up the terms of the agreement.  Ned suggests they phrase the bet as
 ``the father of the boy who doesn't win'' to avoid hurt feelings.  Marge
 writes up the bet and asks, ``I hope blood won't be necessary.''  Once
 Ned steps outside, he asks himself, ``Good gravy, what have I done?''

 Homer, Bart, and Lisa are at the miniature golf course yet again.
   
   Homer: Keep your left arm straight, Bart!  Rotate your shoulders!
   Lisa+Bart: Daaaad!
   Homer: Look son, all I'm asking is that you try.
   Bart:  Ok, I'll try.
   Homer: D'oh!  Anybody can try!  I want you to &lt;win&gt;!
   -- ``''
   
 Bart swats at the ball, which bounces off an obstacle and careens back
 towards Homer, who ducks out of the way.

 Homer fishes through the closet.  He holds up two of Marge's dresses.
 ``Give me your honest opinion.  This... or this?''

 [End of Act Two.  Time: 15:15]

 Homer stands vigil over Bart's bed.  Bart wakes up, sees Homer, and
 screams.  Homer gently reminds Bart that today is the day of the
 tournament, and less gently threatens Bart that he'd better win.
 Downstairs, Marge prepares a breakfast of steak and eggs.
 Homer reads the paper...
   
   Heh heh heh.  That crazy Marmaduke.
   -- Homer reads the morning paper, ``''
   
 ... while Lisa drills Bart one last time.
   
   Lisa: Eighth hole.
   Bart: Aim for the octopus, third tentacle.
   Lisa: Twelfth hole.
   Bart: Bank it off the pink tombstone.
   Lisa: Nirvanha.
   Bart: A state of bliss obtained through the extinction of the self.
   -- pre-game drills, ``''
   
 Lisa refuses to let Bart eat steak and eggs.  Bart is on a strict diet
 of complex carbohydrates; steak will make him logey.  Lisa suggests a
 breakfast of oatmeal.
   
   Lisa:  Oats are what a champion thoroughbred eats before he or she
          wins the Kentucky Derby.
   Homer: Newsflash, Lisa, Bart is not a horse!
   -- the breakfast table the day of the contest, ``''
   
 ``Eat your steak, boy.''

 Tournament preparations are complete.
   
   Good afternoon everybody, and welcome to the finale of what has already been
   a stirring afternoon of miniature golf.  The cream has risen.  The
   wheat has bid farewell to the chaff.  And now, we approach the
   championship match where but two warriors remain:  The heretofore
   unknown Bart Simpson and Todd Flanders, one of the most skilled
   ten-year-olds to ever take back the blade.
   -- K.B.B.L. announcer, ``''
   
   Lisa: Bart, having never received any words of encouragement myself,
         I'm not sure how they're supposed to sound.  But here goes.
         I believe in you.
   Bart: Thanks, man.
   -- pre-game pep talk, ``''
   
   Hey Flanders, it's no use praying.  I already did the same thing, and
   we can't &lt;both&gt; win.
   -- Homer, ``''
   
 Ned explains that they were merely praying that no one gets hurt.
 (At a golf tournament?)
   
   Homer: This time tomorrow, you'll be wearing high heels!
   Ned:   Nope, &lt;you&gt; will.
   Homer: 'Fraid not.
   Ned:   'Fraid so!
   Homer: 'Fraid not.
   Ned:   'Fraid so!
   Homer: 'Fraid not infinity!
   Ned:   'Fraid so infinity plus one!
   Homer: D'oh!
   -- ``''
   
 Todd tees of first and sinks a hole-in-one.  Bart says to himself, ``Tree
 falling in the woods...  Tree falling in the woods...  Tree falling in
 the...''  He putts without looking.  And sinks a hole-in-one.

 The battle continues to the final hole.
   
   If one looks up courage in the Oxford English Dictionary, one might very
   well come upon a photo of these two gladiators.  They approach the final
   hole in the shadow of the Great Emancipator, deadlocked at eight strokes
   on the happy side of par.  Soon, one man will emerge triumphant; he will
   drink naught but champagne, while his opponent tastes bitter defeat in
   this oft cruel game.
   -- ``''
   
 Todd's putt lands a few feet from the hole.  Next up is Bart.
   
   Homer: Remember what Vince Lombardi said:
          If you lose you're out of the family!
   Marge: Homer!  [slap]
   Homer: Ow.
   -- words of encouragement during the golf match, ``''
   
 The ball heads for the obstacle.  All gasp as it appears it won't make
 it through.  Then all breathe a sigh of relief when it does.  Bart's
 ball lands about the same distance from the hole as Todd's.
   
   Bart: This is pretty tense, isn't it, Todd.
   Todd: Yeah, my knees are shaking, I got butterflies in my stomach...
         But I guess this builds character.
   Bart: Who wants to build character?  Let's quit!
   Todd: Okay.
   -- ``''
   
 The two pick up their balls and announce that they wish to declare the
 match a draw.  After a brief consultation of the rule book, the judge
 agrees.
   
   This is the most stirring display of gallantry and sportsmanship since
   Mountbatten gave India back to the Punjabs.
   -- Tearful announcer, ``''
   
 Bart and Todd are each presented with a novelty check for $25.
 Ned is relieved that the bet is off, but Homer sticks to the letter
 of the bet:  Since Todd didn't win, Ned has to mow the lawn.  Ned
 reminds Homer that he must do the same, and Homer says it's a small
 price to pay.

 As a crowd of onlookers cheer and hoot, Ned and Homer mow each other's
 lawns wearing their respective wives' Sunday dress.  The other family
 members look on embarrassed.  (Except for Bart, who seems to be enjoying
 it.)
   
   Mm.  My best dress...
   -- Marge watches Homer mow the lawn in her Sunday dress,
      ``''
   
   Why do I get the feeling that someday I'll be describing this to a psychiatrist?
   -- Lisa watching Homer mow the lawn in Marge's dress, ``''
   
 Homer is profoundly humiliated, but Ned chuckles, the situation reminding
 him of the stunts from his college days.  Moans Homer, ``Oh my God, he's
 enjoying it!''

 EPISODE TITLE: Bart vs. Thanksgiving


EPISODE SUMMARY: 

   

 Humming `Greensleeves', Marge snaps on a pair of latex gloves and proceeds
 to unstuff the turkey.  Maggie descends from her high chair and pays a
 visit to the living room.
   
   Lisa:  Mmph. [as Bart muffles her with a cushion]
   Homer: Bart!  Stop fighting with your sister!
   Bart:  She took my glue!
   Lisa:  It's not yours, Bart.  This is family glue!
   Homer: Stop it, you two.  This is Thanksgiving, so glue friendly or I'll take
          your glue away and then &lt;no one&gt; will have any glue to glue with.
   -- ``''
   
   Lisa: Dad, this isn't about glue.  It's about territoriality.
         He only wants the glue because I'm using it.
   Bart: Oh yeah?  Prove it.
   Lisa: [hands him the glue]  Here.
   Bart: Hey man, I don't want your stupid glue.
   -- ``''
   
 Bart tosses the glue away, and it lands in front of Maggie.  She reaches
 toward it, but Lisa snatches it before Maggie can mistake it for a bottle
 of formula.  Lisa heads upstairs, and Maggie follows.
   
   Bill:  Uh oh, here comes our friend, Bullwinkle J. Moose.
   Homer: Heh heh heh, Bullwinkle's antler sprung a leak.
   Bill:  Uh oh, looks like ol' Bullwinkle's kinda gotten a taste of his
          own medicine.  Ha ha.
   Marty: He certainly does, Bill.
   Bill:  Ha ha.  Wait, what did...  Did what I say make sense?
   Marty: Well, no, not really Bill.
   Bill:  Boy, now I know how the pilgrims felt.
   Marty: What are you talking about, Bill?
   -- Watching the Thanksgiving Day parade, ``''
   
 Bart doesn't recognize Bullwinkle or Underdog and complains that they
 ought to use ``cartoons made in the last fifty years.''
   
   Son, this is a tradition.  If they start building a balloon for every
   flash-in-the-pan cartoon character, you'll turn the parade into a FARCE.
   [the Bart Simpson balloon floats past]
   -- Homer watches the Thanksgiving Day parade with Bart,
      ``''
      [a little meta-humor for your enjoyment]
   
 Maggie makes a dangerous trek up the stairs, dodging a skateboard, frayed
 electrical wires, and other roadblocks.  Lisa shows Maggie the centerpiece
 she's been working on, ``a tribute to the trailblazing women who made our
 country great,'' including Georgia O'Keefe, Susan B. Anthony, and Margery
 Stoneman Douglas (who worked to preserve the Everglades).  She invites
 Maggie to make a contribution.  Maggie scrawls on the centerpiece with a
 magic marker, and Lisa embraces her.  ``Oh, thank you.''

 In the kitchen, Marge asks Bart to stay out of her way, so he offers to
 help out.  Marge asks him to do the cranberry sauce.  Bart has trouble
 finding the can, then the can opener.  Then he is unable to get the can
 opener to work.
   
   It's broken, Mom.  ...  Mom, it's broken. ... [sings]  Mom-it's-brok-en,
   Mom-it's-brok-en, Mom-it's-brok-en, Mom-it's-brok-en....
   -- Bart `helps out' in the kitchen,  ``''
   
 Marge opens the can, and Bart slowly lets the sauce glop onto the plate,
 still in the cylindrical shape from the can.  ``Ah, cranberry sauce a la
 Bart.''  Marge asks Bart to put it in the fridge, but Bart has already
 left.  Before Marge gets to it, the sauce collapses into an amorphous glob.

 Maggie wanders into the living room, where Homer is watching TV.
   
   See Maggie, those silver-and-blue guys are the Dallas Cowboys.  They're
   Daddy's favorite team.  And he wants them to lose by less than five and
   a half points.  Understand?
   -- Homer, ``''
   
 The receiver takes a nasty hit.  He's flat on his back.
   
   Looks like they'll be feeding him Thanksgiving dinner through a tube.
   -- Sportscaster on the football player's injury, ``''
   
 Marge reminds Homer to pick up Grampa, and Homer defers it until halftime.
 Patty and Selma arrive, carrying pots of Swedish meatballs and trout
 almandine, respectively.  Marge is upset that they don't trust her
 cooking.  They explain that they merely brought backups in case some
 people found her turkey too dry.  Homer greets the twins and leaves to
 pick up Grampa.

 In the car, Homer angrily mimics Patty and Selma's grunting, then turns
 on the car radio.
   
   Announcer: And now, get set for our fabulous halftime show, featuring the
              well-groomed young go-getters of `Hooray for Everything!'
   Homer:     Oh, I love those kids.  They've got such a great attitude!
   Announcer: Ladies and gentlemen, `Hooray for Everything' invites you
              to join them in a salute to the greatest hemisphere on earth,
              the Western Hemisphere!  The dancingest hemisphere of all!
   -- Football halftime show, ``''
   
 Homer `dances' his fingers and shoulders and bobs his head to the music.
 He arrives at the retirement home, where their dinner is about to begin.
   
   Now, before we sit down to our delicious turkey puree, I have some, uh,
   happy news.  The following people have relatives who wished they could
   be here today...
   -- At the rest home, ``''
   
 He reads off a list of names, and a fax comes in.  ``Oh, and Mrs. Spencer,
 you too.''  ``Oh, I knew they wouldn't forget me.''  Homer comes in
 and drags Grampa away.

 A taxi pulls in front of the house, and Marge's mother comes out.
   
   I have laryngitis.  It hurts to talk.  So I'll just say one thing...
   You never do anything right.
   -- Mrs. Bouvier, ``''
   
 Maggie is watching the end of the halftime show as Marge brings food
 from the kitchen to the dining table.
   
   Thank you!   You're super!   Be good to each other!
   -- `Hoorary for Everything' entertains during the football halftime show,
      ``''
   
   In the Silverdome, now ablaze with flashbulbs, as `Hooray for Everything'
   leaves the field!  Of course, a stadium is much too big for flash pictures
   to work, but nobody seems to care!
   -- Announcer for the halftime show, ``''
   
 Homer tries to get a fire started in the fireplace with a set of bellows,
 but isn't making any progress.  Marge calls that dinner is ready (``The
 hell with this!'' yells Homer), and the guests are seated.  Lisa comes
 down with the centerpiece.
   
   Holy moley!  That's the biggest... one of those I ever saw!
   -- Homer appreciates Lisa's Thanksgiving dinner table centerpiece,
      ``''
   
 ``Definitely from our side of the family,'' notes Selma.  Lisa's
 description of the centerpiece is interrupted by Bart, who brings
 in the turkey.  He tells Lisa to move the centerpiece to free up
 ``valuable real estate'' for the turkey.  Bart and Lisa struggle
 for the centerpiece, which lands in the fireplace.  The fire roars
 to life.  (``Hey, that got 'er goin'!'' observes Grampa.)  Lisa
 attacks Bart, crying, ``You don't even care!'', then runs upstairs
 to her room in tears.
   
   Homer: All right Bart, that's it!  Go to your room!  Now!
   Bart:  Okay, I'll take some white meat and stuffing to go, and
          send up the pumpkin pie in about 20 minutes.
   -- ``''
   
 Marge scolds, ``I hope you're happy, Bart!  You've ruined Thanksgiving!''

 [End of Act One.  Time: 8:17]

 Bart grumbles in his room.  Downstairs...
   
   And Lord, we are especially thankful for nuclear power, the cleanest,
   safest energy source there is.  Except for solar, which is just a pipe dream.
   Anyway, we'd like to thank you for the occasional moments of peace and
   love our family has experienced.  Well, not today, but... You saw what
   happened!  Oh, Lord, be honest!  Are we the most pathetic family in the
   universe or what!
   -- Homer says grace at Thanksgiving dinner, ``''
   
 ``Amen'' says all.  ``Worst prayer yet,'' notes Selma.  Lisa's sax
 playing can be heard downstairs, and Marge goes up to talk to her.
   
   Lisa:  Mom, I poured my heart into that centerpiece!  [which Bart destroyed]
          Things like that &lt;always&gt; happen in this family.
   Marge: I noticed that, too.
   -- ``''
   
 Marge tells Bart he can come down to dinner if he apologizes to Lisa.
 Bart scoffs, ``They think they can starve an apology out of me?  Ha!''
 He climbs out the window and down a nearby tree, landing in a patch of
 daisies.  ``Uh oh.  ...  I mean, good!'' and starts stomping the flowers
 with renewed vigor.  Santa's Little Helper is thrown out of the house
 for swiping a drumstick.  Bart and SLH head off.  They find Monty Burns'
 mansion.  Inside, Burns congratulates Smithers on yet another excellent
 repast.  ``I couldn't eat another bite.  Dispose of all this.''  Burns
 indicates a huge banquet table still loaded with food.  Though he did
 save room for some pumpkin pie, which is cooling on the window sill.
 Bart climbs through the hedges, spots the pie, and reaches for it.  But
 his hand crosses laser beam detectors, and Burns' security are alerted.
 ``The intruder appears to be a young male, age 9 to 11.''  Burns responds,
 ``Release the hounds.''  Bart narrowly escapes with his life.

 Meanwhile, Lisa is in her room at her desk.
   
   I saw the best meals of my generation
   destroyed by the madness of my brother.
   My soul carved in slices
   by spikey-haired demons.
   -- `Howl of the Unappreciated' by Lisa Simpson, ``''
   
 Bart reassures SLH that they'll get food, ``even if we have to pay for it.''
 Bart crosses railroad tracks to the seedy part of town.
   
   Cool!  The wrong side of the tracks!
   -- Bart crosses the railroad tracks, ``''
   
 He spots a sign in the Springfield Plasma Center, offering to pay $12
 for a blood donation.
   
   Twelve bucks!  Hey, I can bleed!
   -- Bart observes he can make $12 by giving blood, ``''
   
   Nurse: Hey, you've gotta be eighteen to sell your blood.  Let's see some ID.
   Bart:  Here ya go, doll-face.
   Nurse: Okay, Homer, just relax.
   Bart:  Ow!
   -- Bart gives blood to make some money, ``''
   
 Back home...
   
   At the risk of losing my voice, let me just say one more thing:
   I'm sorry I came.
   -- Mrs. Bouvier makes a rare comment, ``''
   
 Selma wonders when Bart will apologize.  ``He sure is stubborn.''
   
   Grampa: Homer was never stubborn.  He always folded instantly over anything.
           It was as if he had no will of his own.  Isn't that true, Homer?
   Homer:  [sycophantically] Yes, Dad.
   -- ``''
   
 Bart staggers out of the Plasma Center, a cookie in his hand.
   
   Twelve bucks and a free cookie!  What a country!  [passes out]
   -- Bart gives blood, ``''
   
 SLH eats the cookie.

 [End of Act Two.  Time: 13:12]

 Two street bums find Bart and take him to a soup kitchen.
   
   All right!  Twelve big ones and free grub to boot.  Viva Skid Row!
   -- Bart learns about life on the wrong side of the tracks,
      ``''
   
 Kent Brockman from Channel 6 (KWZ) is making a live news report.
   
   Kent: Oh, we have lots of names for these people.  Bums, deadbeats, losers,
         scums of the earth.  We'd like to sweep these people into the gutter,
         or if they're already in the gutter, to some other out-of-the-way
         place.  Oh, we have our reasons.  They're depressing, they wear
         ragged clothes, they're [makes quotation sign with fingers] ``crazy'',
         they smell bad.
   Guy:  Hey, listen, man.
   Kent: [whispers]  Wait, I'm going somewhere with this.
   -- Kent Brockman's Emmy-winning news report from a soup kitchen,
      ``''
   
 The family are watching the report on TV.
   
   Marge:  Everyone, Lisa wants to read us a poem she's written.
   Grampa: Sounds interesting.
   Homer:  Oh, okay.
   Lisa:   Ahem.  `Howl of the Unappreciated'.  By Lisa Simpson.  Ahem.
           `I saw the best meals...' [Bart appears on television]
   Grampa: Gasp.  It's Bart!
   Homer:  What show is &lt;this&gt;?
   -- Bart manages to upstage Lisa from miles away, ``''
   
   Kent: And how long have you been on the streets?
   Bart: Going on five years, Kent.
   Kent: Ah.  Son, your family may be watching.  Is there anything you'd like
         to say to them?
   Bart: Yes there is, Kent.  Ha ha!  I didn't apologize!
   -- Bart is interviewed for a television documentary, ``''
   
   Operator, give me the number for nine-one-one!
   -- Homer, ``''
   
 Kent packs his things and leaves.  ``This reporter smells another local
 Emmy.''  One of the bums asks Bart if he's got a place to sleep.  Bart
 says, ``There's this family I kinda hang out with.''  The soup kitchen
 cook says, ``See you at Christmas,'' and closes the doors.  Bart finds
 the money in his pocket.  ``Uh, listen guys, I was thinking.  Unless
 you feel weird about taking money from a kid, I thought maybe...'' He
 gives them the money and rushes home.

 The two cops tell Homer that Bart isn't at the Rescue Mission any more
 and ask what prompted Bart to run away.

 The Thanksgiving dinner guests head for home.
   
   If I'm not back at the home by nine they declare me legally dead and
   collect my insurance!
   -- Grampa rushes back to the rest home, ``''
   
 In the living room...
   
   Marge: Homer, this is a terrible thing that's happened, but we can't
          blame ourselves.
   Homer: We can and will!
   Marge: Children need discipline.  You can ask any syndicated advice columnist.
   -- Worrying about Bart, ``''
   
 Bart reaches the front door and wonders if he should go inside...  He
 dreams of being greeted warmly by the family.  Marge asks, ``Isn't there
 something you'd like to say to your sister?'' Bart responds, ``Okay.
 I'm sorry, too.''  The lighting suddenly turns grim.  Marge scolds, ``No,
 no, no!  That won't do at all!''  Homer says, ``Yeah, boy.  Get down
 on your knees and BEG for forgiveness!''  Lisa evilly adds, ``Yeah.  Beg
 me Bart.  Beg me!''  Bart does so, but they just laugh in his face.
   
   Marge:  Now we can blame him for everything!
   Homer:  It's your fault I'm bald!
   Bart:   [meekly] I'm sorry.
   Grampa: It's your fault I'm old!
   Bart:   I'm sorry!
   Maggie: It's your fault I can't talk!
   Bart:   I'm sorry!
   Uncle Sam: It's your fault America has lost its way!
   Bart:   I'm sorry!
   All:    It's all your fault!  It's all your fault!  It's all your fault!
   -- Bart's dream, ``''
   
 Bart returns to reality.  ``I'm sorry all right.  Sorry I came back here.''
 He climbs a tree and hops onto the roof.
   
   Whoa!  My whiffle balls!  My frisbees!  My water rockets!
   I've hit the jackpot!
   -- Bart climbs to the roof, ``''
   
 Bart plays football on the roof.  Meanwhile, Lisa is at her desk.
   
   Dear Log:  My brother is still missing, and maybe it's my fault because
   I failed to take his abuse with good humor.  I miss him so much already
   that I don't... know... [sobs]
   -- Lisa writes in her diary, ``''
   
 Bart hears Lisa's sobbing through a ventilation pipe and invites her up.
 Lisa joins him on the roof.
   
   Lisa: Bart, what are you doing up here?  Everybody's worried!
   Bart: Really?  Did they cry?
   Lisa: Yes.
   Bart: Whoa!  Bulls-eye!
   -- Lisa joins Bart on the roof after his brief career as a runaway,
      ``''
   
 She asks why he burnt her centerpiece.  ``Was it because you hate me?
 Or because you're bad.''
   
   I don't know!  I don't know why I did it!  I don't know why I enjoyed it!
   And I don't know why I'll do it again!
   -- Bart doesn't apologize to Lisa, ``''
   
 Lisa tells him, ``The only reason to apologize is if you look deep down
 inside yourself, and you find a spot, something you wish wasn't there
 because you feel bad you hurt your sister's feeling.''  Bart gives in
 and closes his eyes.  ``This is so stupid.  I'm not going to find anything.
 Just because I wrecked something she worked really hard on, and I made
 her cr---... Uh oh. ... I'm sorry, Lisa.''  Lisa accepts the apology.
 Homer peeks out from the bathroom window.
   
   You know, Marge?  We're great parents!
   -- Homer watches Bart apologize to Lisa on the roof, ``''
   
 At 11pm, the family are gathered around the kitchen table...
   
   Homer: Oh Lord, on this blessed day, we thank Thee for giving our family
          one more crack at togetherness.
   All:   Amen.
   -- Homer says grace at the second Thanksgiving dinner,
      ``''
   
 They then dig into turkey sandwiches.

    ... the obvious proctological reference in the first scene?
    ... right on the word FARCE (which Homer bellows out in classic Homer
        style) the Bart balloon comes on screen?  Not coincidentally,

        door?  (Note the turkey decoration on the back door, or is it a door
        knocker?)

        T.V. dinner?
    ... when the family is watching T.V., Marge's mother appears to be wearing
        big thick shoes, or could they be `Army Boots'?
    ... when Bart's on the roof, you see the outdoor T.V. antenna?  Obviously
        not used.  (The position of the antenna sometime changes from scene
        to scene and episode to episode.)

 Freeze Frame Fun


 The wrong side of the tracks:


    * ``MASSAGE'' PARLOUR     [the quotation marks are on the sign]
    * LIQUOR
    * PAWN
    * WE HAVE ROT GUT!        [Silly sign: `rotgut' is one word.]

 Lisa's room

    * Poster:  End Apartheid Now.
    * Happy little Elf picture on the wall.
    * Books on her shelf:  Poe Poetry, Ginsberg, On the Road.
    * Lisa's chair is one of those cool kneel-sit chairs.

 Animation and continuity goofs


David Tamkin @{dwt} notes that, the opening fast pan of Springfield shows
Springfield Retirement Castle a short walk away from the Simpsons residence.
Yet in this episode, the Castle is a Home, and Homer has to drive there.

Bennett W. Cleveland and Dennis Ward point out that Homer is watching the
Dallas Cowboys, yet the announcer says they are in the Silverdome, home of
the Detroit Lions.  By tradition (since the 1940's), the Lions always play
Thanksgiving at home.  In the 1960's the Cowboys were also granted that
honor.  So they couldn't possibly be playing each other.

Patty's sundress turns blue when she says that Marge's turkey is dry.

 Comments and other observations


  Maggie falls

    * After climbing down from her high chair.
    * Twice following Lisa upstairs.
    * Twice coming into Lisa's room.
    * Returning to the living room where Homer is watching TV.
    * When Bart appears on TV.
    + For a total of seven falls.

 References to previous episodes

    * [7[FG]05] Jasper is doing a crossword puzzle from the newspaper.
    * [7[FG]07] Homer's hi-fi 8-track, football player named Wolodarsky.

 Music


 The Thanksgiving Day Parade


The music for the parade was Sousa's `Washington Post March', I think.

It changes to something else when Bullwinkle appears.

 Hooray for Everything


Chris Lipski recognizes the music used by `Hooray for Everything' as ``Get
Dancin' '' by Disco Tex and his Sex-o-lettes.  ``One of my fave disco cheezee
hits from the 70's'' he says.

 We Gather Together To Ask the Lord's Blessing


The ``hit Protestant prayer tune'' @{cep} appears thrice as incidental music.
\Q
    1. when Mrs. Bouvier comes out of the taxi.                         \\
    2. when Lisa brings down the centerpiece.                           \\
    3. when the family sit down for their second Thanksgiving dinner.
\eQ
Stephen W. Smoliar (smoliar\@hilbert.iss.nus.sg) consulted his hymnal:
\Q
        We gather together to ask the Lord's blessing,                  \\
        He chastens and hastens His will to make known;                 \\
        The wicked oppressing now cease from distressing.               \\
        Sing praises to His name--He forgets not His own.
\eQ
Roger Lustig (roger\@phoenix.princeton.edu) says it's an old hymn tune from
Colonial times, if not earlier.

 The soup kitchen


The music playing at the soup kitchen is the same music that was playing
at SNPP in `Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire' [7[FG]08].

 Lisa's Poem


Constance Stillinger (connie\@sushi.psych.nwu.edu) points out that
Lisa's poem derives from `Howl' by Allen Ginsberg:
\Q
    I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by
    madness, starving hysterical naked....
\eQ
Note the copy of Ginsberg works on Lisa's bookshelf.

This and other poems by Lisa are archived in `The Simpsons Uncensored Family
Album'.

 Mr. Burns's mansion


The Burns mansion is located at the corner of Croesus and Mammon.

Croesus was the last king of Lydia (560 - 546 BC) known for his great wealth.
By extension, it means any rich man.  There is an idiom, `Rich as Croesus'.

David Tamkin @{dwt} adds:

Mammon, derived from the classical Hebrew word for personal wealth,
came to be used as a name for a postulated god of greed (or personification
of greed) in medieval literature.  A typical usage was ``worshiping Mammon
instead of the Lord.''

Evidently Burns got to name those streets himself.  At least he gave his
guards on duty frozen dinners with turkey in them.

 Misc.


This episode gets my vote for best music.  ``We gather together to ask
the Lord's blessing...''

 EPISODE TITLE: Bart the Daredevil


EPISODE SUMMARY: 

   

 While Bart and his pals crowd around the TV set to watch pro wrestling,
 Lisa reads a book.
   
   Live, from the Springfield Center for the Performing Arts,
   the wrestling match of the century!
   -- Announcer, ``''
   
   Announcer: Rasputin, the friendly Russian!
   Lewis:     Didn't he use to be the Mad Russian?
   Lisa:      Yes, but I'm afraid the forces of history have changed
              wrestling, perhaps forever.
   -- ``''
   
   
   Bart:  [in the Simpsons' living room, watching a wrestling match]          \\
          If you ask me, this is going to be one helluva match.
   Lisa:  Oh, Bart, I hope you're not taking this seriously.
          Even a 5-year-old knows that this is as choreographed as any ballet!
   Homer: [in Moe's tavern]                                                   \\
          Eh, Rasputin's got the reach, but on the other hand,
          the Professor's got his patented coma lock.
          If you ask me, this is going to be one helluva match.
   -- Great minds think alike, ``''
   
 The match between Rasputin and Professor Werner von Brawn begins...
   
   Rasputin is spinning the professor like an autogyro.
   That's &lt;got&gt; to be disorienting...
   -- Announcer for wrestling match, ``''
   
 Bart asks Milhouse to turn up the volume, and steals his seat.
 Homer does the same to Barney.  Brawn wins the match by cheating.
 (What?  Pro wrestling has rules?)  Next comes a TV advert for
 the Monster Truck Rally...
   
   If you miss this, you'd better be dead... or in jail...
   And if you're in jail, break out!
   -- Announcer for ``Truck-o-Saurus'', ``''
   
 Homer rushes home as Bart rushes to the front door to greet him.
 They have the same thing on their mind:  Truck-o-Saurus!
 At the dinner table...
   
   Homer: I have an announcement to make.  As a family growth thing, Bart and
          I think we should all go to the monster truck rally this Saturday.
   Lisa:  Aren't you forgetting something?
   Homer: Uh... Monster truck rally... Growth thing.  No, I don't think so.
   -- at the dinner table, ``''
   
   I'll be playing my first solo!  If you miss it on Saturday,
   I'd advise you to start looking for a child therapist on Sunday.
   -- Lisa, ``''
   
   Oh cruel Fate!  Why do you mock me?
   -- Homer, ``''
   
 Marge points out that they can go to Lisa's recital first, then afterwards
 go to the Monster Truck Rally.  At the concert...
   
   Skinner:  Tonight, Sherberts, oops, heh heh, Schubert's Unfinished Symphony.
   Homer:    Oh good, unfinished.  This shouldn't take long.
   Marge:    Mmmmm.
   -- music recital, ``''
   
 Despite Mr. Largo's exhortation of ``Remember children, stay together!'',
 they fall out of step within the first two seconds.  (What'd you
 expect?  They're only eight years old!)  Lisa executes her solo, but
 Homer is anxious to leave.  Todd Flanders has a solo...
   
   Flanders: [weeping at his son's solo]  My son!  My son!
   Homer:    Come on Flanders, he's not &lt;that&gt; bad.
   -- music recital, ``''
   
 The concert concludes with the 1812 Overture, complete with cannons.
 Homer takes Lisa away almost before the last note is played.
 He drives recklessly through traffic to get to Springfield Speedway.
   
   I reached him!
   -- Lisa, on Homer humming the 1812 Overture while driving recklessly,
      ``''
   
 but all the parking spots are taken.  They accidentally drive into the
 arena itself, where they are attacked by Truck-o-Saurus, ``twenty tons
 and four stories of car-crunching fire-breathing prehistoric insanity''...

 [End of Act One.  Time: 6:12]

 The car is a total wreck, and the rescue team has trouble pulling
 Homer's girth out of the car.  The insurance adjuster writes Marge
 a check, which she squirrels away in her hair.  The family then take
 their seats...
   
   Let the destruction begin!
   -- Homer, at the Monster Truck Rally, ``''
   
 The last event of the evening is...
   
   The world's greatest daredevil, the man who's no stranger to danger,
   if he's not in action, he's in traction... Captain Lance Murdoch!
   -- Announcer at Monster Truck Rally, ``''
   
   Ladies and gentlemen, and especially little children.  I'm glad you're
   all here to witness what may very well be my grisly death.  Tonight, my
   most dangerous stunt.  I will death-defy both nature and gravity by
   leaping over this tank of water, filled with man-eating great white sharks,
   deadly electric eels, ravenous piranha, bone-crushing alligators, and
   perhaps most frightening of all, the king of the jungle, one ferocious lion!
   [a lion is added to the pool]
   Heh heh heh.  I almost forgot.  To add a real element of danger, one
   drop of human blood.
   [pricks his finger, one drop of blood falls in, the pool bubbles furiously]
   Now, in case I don't survive, let me just say, seat belts save lives, so
   buckle up!
   -- Captain Lance Murdoch, at the Monster Truck Rally, ``''
   
   This is &lt;so&gt; cool.
   -- Bart, ``''
   
 Aside from Bart, everybody in the arena is too scared to watch.  Bart
 yells, ``He made it!'' and all cheer.  Murdoch takes a curtain call
 and falls into the pool, where he is fished out and carted off.

 Homer drives what's left of the car home, as Bart daydreams in the
 back seat...
   
   Ladies and gentlemen, the ten-year old who's brave and bold,
   when he's not in class, he's risking his ass,
   the world's greatest daredevil, Bart Simpson!
   -- Announcer in Bart's dream, ``''
   
 To the chant of `Bart!', he jumps his skateboard over a pool.
 Homer wakes him up.
   
   Bart:  Dad, I want to be a daredevil.
   Homer: Heh heh heh.  Kids say such stupid things.
   -- ``''
   
 The next day, Bart tries to jump over a car on his skateboard, but
 fails.
   
   Lewis:    Oh no, he's hurt.
   Richard:  Bad.
   Milhouse: Let's get out of here!
   -- kids after Bart hurts himself doing a stunt, ``''
   
 The family pick up Bart at the hospital.
   
   Marge:  Are you all right?
   Bart:   Better than all right.  I got stitches!  [lifts the bandage]
   Homer+Lisa:  Ewwwww.
   -- in the hospital, ``''
   
 Dr. Hibbert has an idea of how they can discourage Bart from trying again.
   
   Bart, in this ward are the children who have been hurt by
   imitating stunts they saw on television, movies, and the legitimate stage.
   -- Dr. Hibbert, ``''
   
   Dr. H: This little boy broke his leg trying to fly like Superman.
          This boy's brother hit him in the head with a wrench, mimicking a
          recent TV wrestling match.
          I won't even subject you to the horrors of our Three Stooges ward.
   Marge: Gee, I never realized TV was such a dangerous influence.
   Dr. H: Well, as tragic as all this is, it's a small price to pay for countless
          hours of top-notch entertainment.
   Homer: Amen!
   -- Dr. Hibbert shows Bart the injury ward, ``''
   
 Bart returns to attempt his jump a second time, and he succeeds.
 He then jumps over the swimming pool.  He jumps over a
 string of animals.  He jumps over Homer.

 On the class trip, Bart mopes because he's run out of things to jump.
 Then he sees Springfield Gorge.
   
   Hey, this thing's pretty gnarly.
   I bet you could throw a dead body in there, and no one would eeeeever

   -- Otto, on Springfield Gorge, ``''
   
   Bart: Otto, I'm going to leap over Springfield Gorge on my skateboard.
   Otto: You know, Bart, as the only adult here, I feel I should say something?
   Bart: What?
   Otto: COOOOOOOOL!!!!!
   -- ``''
   
 [End of Act Two.  Time: 12:04]
   
   Otto: [humming into the bus microphone]
   Bart: Hey, Otto, can I use that microphone?
   Otto: Sorry, Bart-dude, it's for emergencies only.
   -- on the bus, ``''
   
 Bart takes the microphone to announce that he's going to jump Springfield
 Gorge on Saturday.  With Dr. Hibbert's help, Lisa takes Bart to see Captain
 Lance Murdoch in the hospital.
   
   Murdoch:     [tries to give a thumbs-up sign]  Doc, I heard a snap.
   Dr. Hibbert: Hm.  I'm afraid the bone is broken.  Well, that's all of them!
   -- in the hospital, ``''
   
 Since he can't use his hand, Murdoch writes a long dedication on an
 8 x 10 glossy to Bart by holding the pen in his teeth.  (When we eventually
 see it, it's an illegible scrawl.)  When he learns that Bart intends to
 jump Springfield Gorge...
   
   Now let me start by saying...  Good for you son!
   It's always good to see young people taking an interest in danger.
   Now a lot of people are going to be telling you you're crazy,
   and maybe they're right.  But the fact of the matter is:
   Bones heal.  Chicks dig scars.  And the United States of America
   has the best doctor-to-daredevil ratio in the world!
   -- Captain Lance Murdoch, upon hearing that Bart wants to do a dangerous stunt,
      ``''
   
 Lisa is shocked by this.  The kids leave as Murdoch asks Bart to tell
 the nurse he's ready for his sponge bath.  ``Another fringe benefit.''
 At the dinner table, Bart is mad that Lisa squealed about his plans
 to jump Springfield Gorge.
   
   I'm sorry Bart.  But if you got hurt or died, despite the extra
   attention I'd receive, I'd miss you.
   -- Lisa, ``''
   
 Homer forbids Bart from doing it, but Bart threatens, ``The minute your
 back is turned, I'm grabbing my skateboard and heading for that gorge.''
   
   Homer: He's done it, Marge; there's nothing we can do.
          He's as good as dead! [bawls]
   Marge: You're his father, you've got to try and reason with him.
   Homer: Oh, that never works.  He's a goner!
   -- Bart wants to jump Springfield Gorge on a skateboard, ``''
   
 Marge convinces Homer to have a heart-to-heart talk with Bart.
 Homer pays a visit to Bart's room.
   
   Homer:  Bart?  Bart?
           What are you doing?
   Bart:   [halfway out the window] Uh, nothing.
   -- ``''
   
   Homer: You were on your way to jump the gorge, weren't you!
   Bart:  Maybe.
   -- Bart and the 9th commandment? ``''
   
 He asks Bart to promise that he won't jump the gorge.
   
   Bart, this isn't one of those phony-baloney promises I don't expect
   you to keep!
   -- Homer, having a heart-to-heart with Bart, ``''
   
 Bart promises.  Homer returns to the dinner table, where we see Bart
 skateboard past.  Bart arrives at the gorge, where a crowd of kids has
 gathered to watch.  Homer heads upstairs...
   
   Why that little liar!  I should have...
   And I was going to play pickle with him.
   -- Homer, finding Bart's room empty, ``''
   
 (You need three people to play `pickle'.)

 Bart warms up the crowd, then prepares to make his big jump.  As he
 speeds down the ramp, Homer arrives and tackles him.  Homer takes
 the skateboard...
   
   I tried ordering you, I tried punishing you, and God help me, I even
   tried reasoning with you.
   -- Homer to Bart, ``''
   
 Homer says the only thing left is for him to jump the gorge himself.
 Bart begs him not to and promises not to jump anything any more.
   
   You know boy, I don't think I've ever felt as close to you as I do right...
   -- Homer, slipping away on a skateboard, ``''
   
 Homer speeds down the ramp, and across the gorge.  It looks like he's
 going to make it, but he doesn't.  As if tumbling down the gorge is bad
 enough, the skateboard lands on him.  A helicopter hauls him up, where he
 is placed into an ambulance.  The ambulance tries to speed away, but
 immediately crashes into a tree; the back doors open, and Homer falls out,
 back down the gorge.

 In the hospital, Homer gets the bed next to Captain Lance Murdoch.
   
   You think you've got guts.  Try raising my kids.
   -- Homer to Murdoch, ``''

 Didja notice...


    ... Lisa is reading a book through the entire wrestling match?
    ... the wresling match was sponsored by Duff Beer?
    ... the wrestling match arena was empty in real life, yet we saw
        a packed auditorium on TV?
    ... when Homer rushes home from Moe's, the oil spot is back in the
        driveway?
    ... the unidentifiable food glop they were eating?  (What &lt;was&gt; it?)
    ... the poor guy stuck behind Marge's hairdo at the recital?
    ... when Homer stands and applauds Lisa's solo, Maggie sort of claps,
        too? @{ajr}
        (And when Homer points at his watch, who does he think he's showing
        it to?  Lisa?  Mr. Largo?)
    ... nobody (except Maggie) was wearing seat belts when Truck-o-Saurus
        grabbed the car?  (Especially with respect to Captain Lance Murdock's
        exhortation, ``Seat belts save lives, so buckle up!'')
    ... at the arena, the slogan on the beer mug was ``I survived
        Truck-o-Saurus''?   (Truth in advertising strikes again.)
    ... the sign outside the Emergency Ward:  `Cash Only'?

        tells Bart not to jump Springfield Gorge?
    ... when Homer falls down the gorge the second time, Wendell

    ... when the kids are watching the wrestling, Maggie's walking trainer is
        in a corner?
    ... Homer drives home directly from Moe's Tavern?  (So much for the
        designated driver...)
    ... when Dr. Hibbert is showing the family around the children's
        ward, there looks to be an &lt;eagle&gt; in one of the beds (or maybe
        just a kid with a very large nose)?  Hibbert was pointing at it
        when he said 'the tragic always is'.
    ... when Lisa mentions to Lance Murdoch that Bart intends jumping over the
        Gorge on his skateboard, watch his eyes bulge...
    ... someone with `Lisa-hair' is in the audience when Bart shows off before
        he climbs the ramp?  (A reasonable guess would be to say that it
        was Lisa, since she's the only one I've [cjb] seen with that type of
        hair-style.)

 Animation and continuity goofs


At the gorge,  Nelson (the bully) says, ``Where is he?  I thought he said
noon!'' but notice that Milhouse's mouth also moves to the words.

(And, as a plot discontinuity, Bart never said he was going to jump at noon.
He said, ``May I have your attention, please?  This Saturday, I will be
jumping over Springfield Gorge on my skateboard.  There is a good possibility
I will plunge to my bloody death.  Hope to see you there!  Thank you.'')

As Homer and Bart walk to the house after coming home from Truck-o-Sarus,
as they walk from the driveway, they are shaded on their backs, as though
the light is coming from the left.  When they turn to go inside, walking away
from the viewer, the shading remains on their backs.

But this isn't an animation error.  There are two light sources in the
scene.  The first is the streetlamps, which provides the first shadow.
The second is the lights from the house, which provides the second shadow.

 Comments and other observations


 Bart's T-shirt


Tim P. McNerney @{tpm} observes that Bart's
skull-and-crossbones T-shirt he wears for the jump across the gorge
has a skull with ``Bart-spikes''.

But Jym Dyer @{jd} recalls that the
X-rays in ``Bart Gets Hit By A Car'' shows a
normal skull. (Normal for cartoon characters, that is.)  Bart's spiked skull
is clearly a matter of artistic license on his part.

 The concert


 General notes


Schubert's Unfinished Symphony and Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture are a
bit too highbrow (and difficult!)\ for a bunch of eight-year-olds.

Mr. Largo counts, ``five, six, seven, eight'' before giving the
downbeat.  Unfortunately, the Unfinished Symphony begins in 12/8 time.
(So he really should have counted either, ``7 8 9 10 11 12'' or just
``3 4''.)  And, of course, the tempo he sets is nothing like the tempo
the orchestra plays.  (And, the symphony doesn't even begin that way.
Mr. Largo skipped the introductory bars.)

There is no saxophone part in the Unfinished Symphony, a fortiori, no
saxophone solo.

The playing itself was down to school standards.  Despite Mr. Largo's
exhortation of ``Remember children, stay together,'' they fall out of
step at the moment the first note is played.  And the conclusion of
the 1812 Overture was the embodiment of school concerts.  Everybody
had long since fallen out of step with everybody else, and moved on to
bigger and better things like playing the wrong note.

When Homer says, ``How much longer was Sherbert planning on making
this junk!'', the symphony comes to an end, and all applaud.
Unfortunately, what was played was only the end of the first movement.
The piece was only halfway finished---to the extent that `halfway
finished' applies to an unfinished symphony.
Perfectly in keeping with
what always happens at school concerts.  (Parents applaud during
any break in the action.)

And as the Symphony started, you could hear Maggie sucking away.

Principal Skinner announced that it was the first in a series of Saturday
Evening Concerts.  This is way beyond the abilities of a student orchestra.
It typically takes grammar school orchestras 10 to 14 weeks to prepare for
a single concert.  (Unless they intend to have other performing groups
fill in, like Bart's fourth-grade dance demonstration.)

The only thing missing that I could think of was flashbulbs going off
intermittently as eager parents take pictures of their kids, unaware that
the flashes are immensely distracting.  (And useless beyond 15 feet.)

 Lisa's solo


Brian Heil @{bh3} makes
another interesting note about the concert and Lisa's sax solo:  ``I haven't
paid close enough attention in the past to say if Lisa is lefthanded, but I
assume she is, seeing the way she held the saxophone.  Of course lefthanded
sax players hold it the same way as righthanded players... in fact it is nearly
impossible to play a sax as it was pictured!''

 Todd's solo


Theron Stanford @{tws} identifies Todd's solo as `My Heart at Thy Sweet Voice'
from the opera ``Samson and Delilah'' by Camille Saint-Sa\"ens.

Alan J Rosenthal @{ajr} notes that Todd's bowing was very odd.  When he held
a note, he stopped the bow movement.  Of course, this would stop the sound.

 Butchered in America


Scenes were removed from the original US airing to make room for the ``Do
the Bart Man'' video on first airing, then again for a Gulf War Update
when the episode repeated.  Canadians received a full episode.

One cut scene involved the introduction of a female truck driver at the
monster truck rally.  Note Lisa, ``Another barrier broken.''

 EPISODE TITLE: Itchy and Scratchy and Marge


EPISODE SUMMARY: 

   

 Homer sees Marge making pork chops...
   
   Marge: [making pork chops]
          A dash of rosemary, a smidgen of thyme, a pinch of marjoram...
   Homer: You know, Marge, you make the best pork chops in the whole world.
   Marge: Oh, Homer, they're nothing special.  The extra ingredient is care.
          [continues her work]
          A sprinkle of chervil, a teaspoon of tumeric, and a whisper of MSG.
   -- How much care am I supposed to add?  ``''
   
 ... and offers to build her a spice rack.
   
   Homer: Marge, I'm going to build you a spice rack.
   Marge: Oh, you don't have to go to all that trouble just for me.
   Homer: It's no trouble!  I got a whole &lt;garage&gt; of tools I never use!
   -- ``''
   
 Meanwhile, the kids watch an Itchy and Scratchy cartoon on the Krusty
 the Klown show.  Downstairs, Homer sets to work...
   
   Ah, here it is.  The complete handyman's bookshelf.  Volume 1:  Spice racks.
   -- Homer sets to work to build a spice rack, ``''
   
 Homer produces a clump of wood and nails whose resemblance to a spice
 rack is tenuous at best.  Maggie appears and clonks Homer on the head
 with a mallet.  Upstairs, Homer's head is bandaged...
   
   Bart:  Hey Dad, can you move your head?
   Homer: No, I can't.  It's broken...
   -- Is it in a cast?  ``''
   
 Marge sees the I&amp;S cartoon and concludes that was the cause of Maggie's
 actions.
   
   Maggie: [picks up a pencil]  [wacko `Psycho' music plays]
   Homer:  Aaaaaaaaagh!
   Marge:  [picks up Maggie]  No, Maggie, bad baby!
   Homer:  Keep her away from me, Marge!
           She's got that crazy look in her eyes again!
   -- ``''
   
 She forbids the kids from watching the cartoons.
   
   Marge: You won't be watching these cartoons any more.  Ever.
   Lisa:  But Mom, if you take our cartoons away, we'll grow up without a sense
          of humor and be robots.
   Bart:  Really?  What kind of robots?
   -- ``''
   
 Milhouse invites Bart to watch I&amp;S at his house.  Meanwhile, Homer phones
 in sick...
   
   You heard me, I won't be in for the rest of the week. ...
   I told you!  My baby beat me up! ...
   No, it is not the worst excuse I ever thought up. ...
   [sotto voce] Wise guy.
   -- Homer phones in sick after, well, you know, ``''
   
 Marge wonders why Bart and Lisa are so late from school (because they're
 watching I&amp;S with Milhouse and Janie, respectively).  At the Simpsons
 residence, Marge watches I&amp;S and takes careful notes.
   
   Marge: What kind of warped human being would find that funny?
   Homer: [laughs]
   Marge: Mm...
   -- ``''
   
 Marge decides to write a letter.
   
   Dear purveyors of senseless violence:
   I know this may sound silly at first, but I believe that the cartoons you
   show to our children are influencing their behavior in a negative way.
   Please try to tone down the psychotic violence in your otherwise fine
   programming.  Yours truly, Marge Simpson.
   -- ``''
   
 Mr. Meyers sends back his reply...
   
   Meyers: Take a letter, Miss White.
          Dear valued viewer, thank you for taking an interest in the Itchy
          and Scratchy program.  Enclosed is a personally autographed photo of
          America's favorite cat and mouse team to add to your collection.
          In regards to your specific comments about the show, our research
          shows that one person cannot make a difference, no matter how big
          a screwball she is, so let me close by saying...
   Marge: [reading the letter] And the horse I rode in on?
          I'll show them what one screwball can do!
   -- A letter from the CEO, ``''
   
 [End of Act One.  Time 5:30]

 Marge and her family picket outside the Itchy and Scratchy International
 building.  She explains to Maude that she's founded S.N.U.H.,
 Springfieldians for Nonviolence, Understanding, and Helping.  Bart and Lisa
 excuse themselves to do wholesome childlike things.  [wink wink]  Marge's
 protest gains momentum...
   
   Marge: [through a megaphone]
          How many of you were hit on the heads with mallets last week?
          [crowd murmurs]
          [man with head bandaged raises his hand]
          [another man with head bandaged raises his hand]
          [and a whole bunch more]
   -- ``''
   
 Dinner is TV dinners, to Homer's annoyance...
   
   Homer: There's peas in my fruit cobbler!
   Lisa:  There's peas &lt;everywhere&gt;!
   -- The infamous TV dinners, ``''
   
 Marge apologizes for the dinners and forbids Bart from watching cartoons.
 Homer suggests making up for tonight's dinner by making pork chops tomorrow,
 but Marge realizes she's too busy running protests.
   
   D'oh!  Twenty million women in the world and I had to marry Jane Fonda.
   -- Homer, ``''
   
 The Krusty the Klown show is on the air...
   
   Krusty: Hi Kids! [laughs]  Guess what, Sideshow Mel!
   Mel:    [slide whistle three times]
   Krusty: It's time for Itchy and Scratchy!
   Kids:   [really, parents]  Boo!
   Krusty: Hey, hey, settle down boys and girls, or Krusty will
           have to bring out his old friend, Corporal Punishment, again.
   -- Krusty faces Kancellation, ``''
   
 Marge leads the parents in a chant...
   
   Marge: What do we want?
   Crowd: Less and less violence in children's programming!
   Marge: When do we want it?
   Crowd: Now!
   -- We're mad as hell, and we're not going to take it any more,
      ``''
   
 Krusty tries to contain the crowd, with no success.  Mr. Meyers
 reviews the videotape in his office, then holds a meeting.
   
   Meyers:  That screwball Marge Simpson, we've got to stop her.  But how?
   Man #1:  Drop an anvil on her?
   Man #2:  Hit her on the head with a piano.
   Woman:   Stuff her full of TNT, then throw a match down her throat and run?
   Meyers:  All your fancy degrees and that's the best you can do?
            You make me sick!
   All:     [agree meekly]
   -- ``''
   
 The crowd of protesters outside I&amp;S Intl gives a cartoonist an idea...
 Homer and Marge watch I&amp;S...
   
   You know, some of these stories are pretty good.
   I never knew mice lived such interesting lives.
   -- Homer watches Itchy and Scratchy, ``''
   
 ... and this cartoon features a squirrel with a distinctive hairdo who
 tells I&amp;S to stop fighting.  They whack her head off.  Homer fails to
 see the connection.  Marge is invited to appear on `Smartline'.
   
   Hello, I'm Kent Brockman, and welcome to another edition of `Smartline'.

   course not, what kind of stupid question is that?''

   world's greatest psychiatrist, to give us an insight into the human mind,
   Dr. Marvin Monroe.
   -- `Smartline', ``''
      [Does that make Freud or Monroe the world's greatest psychologist?]
   
 After a brief clip of I&amp;S, the debate begins...
   
   Meyers: I did a little research and I discovered a startling thing...
           There was violence in the past, long before cartoons were invented.
   Kent:   I see.  Fascinating.
   Meyers: Yeah, and know something, Karl?  The Crusades, for instance.
           Tremendous violence, many people killed, the darned thing went
           on for thirty years.
   Kent:   And this was before cartoons were invented?
   Meyers: That's right, Kent.
   -- `Smartline', ``''
   
 Dr. Marvin Monroe adds his two cents...
   
   Well, Kent, to me, the hijinks of a few comic characters absolutely pales
   in comparison to the crippling emotional problems a psychiatrist runs into
   every day.  I'm referring to women who love too much, fear of winning,
   sexaholism, stuff like that.
   -- Dr. Marvin Monroe on `Smartline', ``''
   
 Krusty is next...
   
   Kent:   For another opinion...

   Kent:   Krusty, please.  We're giving you the opportunity to participate in
           a serious discussion, here.
   Krusty: Oh, I'm sorry Kent.  Just that when the camera gets on me, I just...

 Marge get to make her concluding statement, in which she asks all concerned
 parents to write to I&amp;S and express their feelings.  In his office, Mr.
 Meyers goes through the tons of angry mail he's received...  ``The
 screwballs have spoken...''

 [End of Act Two.  Time: 13:00]

 While Marge makes her famous pork chops, she takes a phone call from Mr.
 Meyers who asks Marge for a nonviolent solution to their cartoon.
   
   Meyers: [explaining on the phone]
           Itchy just stole Scratchy's ice cream cone, and...
   Animator: Oh, make it a pie.  Pies are easier to draw.
   Meyers: [to animator] Okay, a pie!
           [to Marge]  Anyway, Scratchy is understandable upset.
   Marge:  Uh huh.
   Meyers: So we figured he could just, you know, grab Itchy and toss him into
           a bucket of acid.
   -- ``''
   
   Marge:  Couldn't Itchy share his pie with Scratchy?
           Then they would &lt;both&gt; have pie!

 so.  But something is subtly different...

   Marge: Well, I think it conveys a very nice message about sharing.
   Bart:  I think it sucks.
   -- A kinder, gentler cartoon, ``''
   
 Homer is startled by Maggie, but she was just handing him a glass of
 lemonade.  The kids give up.
   
   Marge: Aren't you going to watch the rest of your cute cartoons?
   Bart:  Naah.  Come on, Li.
   Lisa:  Maybe there's something else to do on this planet...

 The scene is repeated in TV rooms all across town, and (to the strains
 of the first 53 bars of Beethoven's 6th Symphony) the kids step outside,
 rub their eyes, and proceed to do wholesome childlike things.
 Krusty meanwhile, tapes his show.
   
   Krusty:  Hi, kids!  [laughs]

            Huh?  Is it Saturday?
   -- ``''
   
 At dinner, Marge asks the kids what they did.  Bart and the guys went
 fishing, and Lisa and Janie went bird-watching.  They excuse themselves
 to work on the soapbox racers.  Homer is amazed.  In Florence...
   
   Artist:   This will be the art event of the century.  The greatest
             masterpiece of the Italian renaissance, Michelangelo's David,
             on a coast-to-coast tour of United States.
   Reporter: Uh, sir, which cities will be included on your itinerary?
   Artist:   Eh, New York, Springfield, and if we have time, Chicago,
             Boston, Los Angeles.

 Marge answers the door early in the morning.  It's Maude and Helen,
 recruiting Marge to protest with them against David.
   
   Helen: You've got to lead our protest against this abomination!

 The UCLA visit

This episode was shown, followed by an hour of questions and answers.

his favorites.  David Silverman admitted to being the basis for the

 Left and right


Some concern has been raised for the tendency for episodes to begin by
promoting a liberal point of view, then turning around and going to
the opposite extreme at the end.

Amitava Biswas@{ab} tries to help out:
\Q
I recall hearing an interview of two of the writers (sorry, can't
rememeber the names, some Harvard guys) on Fresh Air with Terry Gross
(National Public Radio) in which they spoke about this very issue of
beginning with a left-wing thing and ending with a right-wing thing.

Their point was that they wanted to show how silly the extremes of
anything can be, left or right.  Concerning this episode (``Itchy and
Scratchy and Marge''), the wanton violence in the cartoons is
certainly uncalled for.  (It's a crazy thing, isn't it? &lt;If&gt; they
actually made cartoons that were violent and &lt;nothing else&gt;, they
probably wouldn't be very funny, but ``Itchy and Scratchy'' is funny
almost precisely &lt;because&gt; it's not funny...)  But censorship has its
down side too.

I do see the point, though, that if you always &lt;end&gt; on the right-wing
message, even if it's patently silly (like the one in ``Mr. Lisa Goes
to Washington''), it can give the implication that [they are
apologizing for their leftist leanings].  Perhaps they should try it
the other way around---starting with a right-wing message and winding
up apologizing for that.

Ultimately, though, it has no meaning.  It's just a bunch of stuff that
happened.

 EPISODE TITLE: Bart Gets Hit by a Car


EPISODE SUMMARY: 

   

 While skateboarding recklessly, Bart gets hit by Mr. Burns' car.
   
   Smithers:  I think the boy is hurt.
   Burns:     Oh for crying out loud, just give him a nickel and let's get going.
   -- after... ``''
   
 Bart's spirit rises from his body...
   
   Hey, cool, I'm dead.
   -- Bart realizes he's dead, ``''
   
 and he takes an escalator to the pearly gates, seeing Great Grampa Simpson
 and a tire-track-marked Snowball on the way.  A voice instructs...
   
   Please hold onto the handrail.  Do not spit over the side.
   [and repeated in Spanish]
   -- Heavenly voice, ``''
   
 Bart spits over the side, and Bart falls down, down, down... as the voice
 chides, `We told you to hold onto the handrail.  We asked you not to spit
 over the side'.  Bart finds himself in the Underworld.
   
   I'm Bart Simpson, who the hell are you?
   -- Bart introduces himself to Satan, ``''
   
 But there seems to have been a mistake...
   
   According to this, you're not due to arrive until the Yankees
   wins the pennant.  That's nearly a century from now.
   -- The Devil, on Bart's premature visit to Hell, ``''
   
   Boy is my face red.
   -- Satan after realizing Bart isn't due to arrive yet,
      ``''
   
   Bart:  Um, say, is there anything I can do to avoid coming back here?
   Satan: Oh, sure, yeah.  But, eh, you wouldn't like it.
   Bart:  Oh, okay!  See you later, then.
   -- Bart leaves Hell, ``''
   
   Satan:  Remember:  Lie, cheat, steal, and listen to heavy metal music!
   Bart:   Yes, sir!
   -- Some parting advice, ``''
   
 Bart ascends to the world of the living and wakes up in a hospital room.
 The family is joined by ...
   
   Hutz:  Hutz is the name, Mr. Simpson.  Lionel Hutz, attorney at law.
          Here's my card.  It turns into a sponge when you put it in water.
   Homer: Ooh, classy.
   -- ``''
   
   Homer: The doctor says it's just a bump on the head and a broken toe,
          nothing serious.
   Hutz:  Pfft.  Doctors.  Doctors are idiots!
   -- ``''
   
   Lisa: Excuse me, Mr. Hutz.  Are you a shyster?
   Hutz: How does a nice little girl like you know a big word like that?
   -- Lisa suspects Lionel Hutz isn't on the level, ``''
   
 Marge asks Hutz to leave, and he does...
   
   Lionel Hutz, attorney-at-law.  What's that, a broken neck?  Great!
   -- Chasing a gurney down the corridor, ``''
   
 Dr. Hibert comes in...
   
   Marge:  Is he well enough for me to start mothering him unbearably, doctor?
   Hibert: Mm, better let him rest up a while first.
   -- ``''
   
 Homer talks to his coworkers about what happened...
   
   Homer:    If I wasn't so spineless, I'd march into Mr. Burns' office
             right now and...
   Smithers: Simpson!
   Homer:    Aah!
   Smithers: Mr. Burns wants you to march into his office right now!
   -- ``''
   
   Ah, Simpson.  At last we meet.
   -- Mr. Burns, calling Homer in regarding Bart's accident,
      ``''
   
 when Burns offers him only $100, Homer notes that this hardly even covers
 the medical bills.  Burns accuses Homer of extortion and tosses him out.
   
   Burns: Throw him out, Smithers!
   Homer: You don't have to do that, Mr. Burns.  I can throw &lt;myself&gt; out.
   -- Burns tells Homer he isn't going to get a cent,
      ``''
   
 Homer wipes his brow with the Hutz sponge and decides to pay him a visit.
   
   The Supreme Court called again.  They need your help on some freedom thing.
   -- Della, Lionel Hutz' secretary, ``''
   
   Yes, Harvard, Yale, MIT, Oxford, The Sorbonne, the Louvre [pron. Loove-rah].
   -- Lionel Hutz, attorney at law, listing his degrees,
      ``''
   
   Mr. Simpson, the state bar forbids me from promising you a big cash settlement.
   But just between you and me, I promise you a big cash settlement.
   -- Lionel Hutz, ``''
   
   You'll be getting more than just a lawyer, Mr. Simpson.
   You'll also be getting this exquisite faux pearl necklace,
   a $99 value, as our gift to you.
   -- ``''
   
 When Hutz says he's looking at $1 million, Homer is pleased.  They go
 to see Nick Riviera, so-called doctor.
   
   Just look at the X-rays!  You see that dark spot there?  Whiplash.
   And this smudge here, that looks like my fingerprint?  No, that's trauma!
   -- `Doctor' Nick Riviera, ``''
   
 Marge raises her objections...
   
   With all due respect, Mrs. Simpson, you're not a doctor, the boy's
   not a doctor, the only person who even comes CLOSE is this man [Nick Riviera].
   -- Lionel Hutz responding to Marge's skepticism, ``''
   
   Hutz:    Doctor, are you sure there isn't a little soft tissue trauma
            in the facial area?
   Riviera: Oh yeah, tons of it! [wrapping Bart's head]  Just say when!
   -- Bart is in the care of trained professionals, ``''
   
 Burns wants to fire Homer, but Smithers fears the headlines...  Burns
 dreams of headlines like ``Burns fires ungrateful employee'', ``Another
 smart move by Burns'', and ``Hooray for Burns!''  Burns agrees to sit
 and wait until the media have forgotten about the incident.  Meanwhile,
 Hutz rehearses Bart's testimony, as Marge's and Lisa's objections are
 ignored.  In court...
   
   I should be able to run over as many kids as I want!
   -- In court, Mr. Burns justifies his actions, ``''
   
   Judge: Mr. Burns, I must warn you that if you continue to disrupt the court
          in this way, I will have to cite you for contempt.
   Burns: You wouldn't dare!
   Judge: Well, no, um, I guess I wouldn't.
   -- ``''
   
 Bart is wheeled to the witness stand.
   
   Judge: Hello, Bart.  Now, you do understand the difference between
          telling the truth and telling a lie, don't you son?
   Bart:  Maybe.
   Judge: Uh huh.  Well, you wouldn't lie to the United States, would you, Bart?
   Homer and Hutz: [prompting, whispering]  No!  No!
   Bart:  No.
   -- Bart takes the witness stand, ``''
   
 Bart tells what happened.  He was playing in his innocent childlike way,
 when...
   
   Defenseless child at three o'clock.
   -- Smithers spying a helpless Bart in the street, ``''
   
 ``Luckily, I was not killed that day.  Though sometimes [sob] I wish I
 had been. [sniff]''
   
   Marge and Lisa:  Mmm...
   -- Reactings to Bart's ``Believable testimony'', ``''
   
 Then Burns takes the stand.
   
   Oh, it was a beautiful day.  The sun was shining.
   I was driving to the orphanage to pass out toys...
   -- Mr. Burns' view of events, ``''
   
 But Bart evilly skateboards into his VW bug...
   
   NOOOOOOOO!!  TAKE ME!!  I'M OLD!!
   -- Mr. Burns' view of events, ``''
   
 The jury are not convinced.  During the recess...
   
   Hang your heads in shame, you overpriced, underbrained glorified notary
   publics!  Just get that big ape to my house tonight and we'll buy him off
   with a banana or two!
   -- Mr. Burns bawling out his attorneys, ``''
   
 David Tamkin notes: He must truly have been agitated.  Normally he would
 know that the plural of attorney is "overpriced, underbrained glorified
 notaries public."

 Marge and Homer are invited to the Burns mansion...
   
   Burns: And that ugly customer was the last Indonesian rhino on earth.
   Marge: Hm, I didn't know you liked animals.
   Burns: Oh, I don't like everything about them.  Just their heads.
   -- Invited to the Burns mansion, ``''
   
   Homer:  Mr. Burns, are you trying to get me drunk?
   Burns:  Yes.
   -- A brief moment of honesty from Monty Burns, ``''
   
 Burns offers a $500,000 settlement and leaves Homer and Marge alone
 to talk it over.  Burns and Smithers spy on them as Homer wants to
 hold out for the $1 million, but Marge fears what Homer has turned into,
 what with shifty lawyers and phony doctors...  Burns returns.
   
   Sorry, offer's expired, I guess we'll just have to let the jury decide,
   twelve good men and true, Smithers release the hounds.
   -- Mr. Burns realizes that Bart made up his story, ``''
   
 Homer and Marge run across the lawn, chased by dogs.  In court, Marge
 is called to the stand by Burns' lawyer.
   
   Bailiff: Do you promise to tell the truth the whole truth and nothing
            but the truth, so help you God?
   Marge:   Mmm... Yes, I do.
   Hutz:    She sounded like she was taking that awful seriously.
   -- ``''
   
 Marge's honest testimony destroys Hutz's case.
   
   Burns: I'm going to write a figure on this piece of paper.  It's not quite
          as large as the last one, but I think you'll find it fair.
          [draws a giant zero]
   Hutz:  I think we should take it.
   -- ``''
   
 At the Simpson dinner table...
   
   Homer: [thinks]  A million dollars.  My wife cost me a million dollars.
   Marge: Homer?  Would you like some more macaroni and cheese?
   Homer: [thinks]  Yeah, a million dollars' worth, you treacherous
          snake-woman! [out loud] No, thank you.
   Marge: Some string beans?
   Homer: [thinks] No, I don't want any string beans either, you two-timing
          back-stabbing... Uh oh, better answer. [out loud] No, thank you.
   Marge: Some celery with cream cheese on it?
   Homer: [thinks] Just mouth polite nothings. [out loud] No, thank you.
   -- ``''
   
 Bart talks about what they could've gotten with the $1 million, and Homer
 excuses himself to go over to Moe's.  Marge's women's intuition tells her
 something.  At Moe's...
   
   Moe:   Oh, you're better off.  Rich people aren't happy.  From the day they're
          born to the day they die, they &lt;think&gt; they're happy, but trust me.
          They ain't.
   Homer: [thinks]  Moe.  Wish he'd shut up.
   -- Homer drowns his sorrows in beer after losing a $1 million court case,
      ``''
   
 Marge arrives...
   
   Homer, I'd like you to forgive me for doing the right thing.
   -- Marge, ``''
   
   Homer: [thinks to himself]  She's been your wife for ten years, you've had
          three children together, it's time to be honest with her.
          [out loud]  I'm not sure I love you any more.
   Marge: Gasp!
   Homer: But, don't worry.  Uh, I'll never let on.  I'll still do all the
          bed stuff.  Maybe it won't be so bad.
   -- ``''
   
 Marge asks Homer to look her in the eyes and decide whether
 or not he loves her.  Homer starts with the feet...
   
   All right, all right.  Look at her if it'll shut her up.
   Start with the feet.  Still angry.  Good!  Good, Homer, good!
   -- Homer's love for Marge is shaken, ``''
   
   Ah, good ol' trustworthy beer.  My love for &lt;you&gt; will never die.
   -- Homer's love for Marge is shaken, ``''
   
 Homer looks her in the eye and says, ``Oh, who am I kidding?  I love you

Also, when Burns' attorney asked Marge for her opinion of Dr. Riviera,
notice that Lionel Hutz didn't raise any objection?  It seems he
didn't learn much about law at the Louvre Law School...

Some people note that Homer indignantly turns down Burns's offer of $500,000
even though that's what he would've gotten if he had won the lawsuit once he
paid Hutz's 50% fee.  But Hutz probably would have claimed 50% of the $500,000
settlement, leaving Homer with $250,000.

 Bart's visit to Hell


Several people have pointed out that the rendition of Hell is taken
Bosch's ``Garden of Earthly Delights''

As to what computer system the devil was using, my careful scrutiny
reveals it to be a Macintosh flavor.  Note the menu bar across the
top of the screen instead of at the top of each window.

Note also the devil was right-handed.  So much for `sinister'
intentions...

 Bart's return to the world of the living


+ Bart passes through earth with dinosaur fossils embedded in it.

+ The Flanderses were getting booster shots on the ground floor of the
  hospital; how typically responsible of them. [David Tamkin]

+ the sign on the door reads `State Booster Program'. [Joe Kincaid]

+ The syringe you see is not a real syringe, but rather is part of the
  inoculation poster. [Thomas C. Allard]

+ The sign on the door reads `Authorized Personnel Only'. [Jeffrey R Carden]

+ Jacques is seeing his proctologist, probably more out of need than
  Flanders-like prevention. [David Tamkin]

+ Bart passes by a room where a body with a toe tag lies in bed.

 Lionel Hutz, the Lawyer


[David Tamkin]

Hutz's sponge card (a degree from the Louvre?) tells us to dial KL 5-LAWW;
he's been clogging our courts since 1974.  [1976, actually. --rjc]

 `Doctor' Riviera


[David Tamkin]

The block from Hutz's office to Riviera's had ``(Something) Nook'' on the
corner, then ``[Your?] Law Offices of Lionel Hutz,'' then ``Gum for Less,''
[which Joe Kincaid points out is a new low in niche marketing] and
finally ``Dr. Nick Riviera, general specialist credit doctor.''  Signs in
Riviera's office windows read ``Yes, we're open'' and ``Yes, we use
anesthetic.''  How reassuring.

Riviera's degrees read ``Mayo Clinic Correspondence School,'' ``Club Med
School,'' ``Female Body Inspector,'' (how about ``Female Body Impersonator''?),
and ``I went to medical school for four years and all I got was this lousy
diploma.''  But as Hutz said, Riviera was the only person in the room who
even came close to being a doctor.

 Burns' story


From: jasmerb@prism.cs.orst.edu (Bryce Jasmer)

Burns driving in that pink VW Bug with purple flowers. I think it was the
music that really made it great.

[dattier@ddsw1.MCS.COM (David W. Tamkin) and jwk@Scripps.EDU (John Kupec)
confirm that the music was "Tijuana Taxi" by Herb Alpert &amp; the Tijuana Brass.]

 Lisa's role


Lisa has but five lines in the entire episode (sigh):

1) Excuse me, Mr. Hutz.  Are you a shyster?
2) Hello, Dr. Hibbert.
3) Dad, may I please make an observation?
4) I think this is all a charade to make Bart look
   more injured than he really is.
5) Mmm.

 EPISODE TITLE: One Fish, Two Fish, Blowfish, Blue Fish


EPISODE SUMMARY: 

 While Marge appears to be tossing a salad (though we see no greens),
 Homer watches the microwave.
   
   Homer: Is it done yet?  Is it done yet?
   Marge: Your meatloaf will be ready in eight seconds, Homer.
   Homer: D'oh!  Isn't there anything faster than a microwave?
   -- Homer watches dinner cook, ``''
   
   Four... three... two... one... Bing!  We have meatloaf!
   -- Homer watches dinner cook in the microwave,
      ``''
   
 ``Get it while it's unbelievable hot, kids!''  The kids come in and
 seat themselves for dinner.
   
   I've got a dried-out end piece with your name on it, Lisa!
   -- Homer serves dinner, ``''
   
   Hm.  Thursday.  Meatloaf night.  As it was, is now, and ever shall be.
   -- Lisa muses on drab dinner fare, ``''
   
   Homer: What are you getting at?
   Lisa:  Well, you're always trying to teach me to be open-minded, try new
          things, live life to the...
   Homer: What are you talking about?  Nobody's trying to teach you that!
   -- Lisa muses on drab dinner fare, ``''
   
 [Notice that the concept of living life to its fullest reappears.]

 Bart hands Homer the ketchup bottle.  Marge thinks Lisa might be right.
   
   Marge: Tomorrow night, it might be nice to go out for dinner.
   Homer: Tomorrow night?  Friday?  Pork chop night?  Marge!  We haven't missed
          pork chop night since the great pig scare in '87!
   -- Marge suggests a change of pace, ``''
   
   Hm.  Friday night.  Pork chops.  From cradle to grave, etched
   in stone and God's library somewhere in heaven...
   -- Lisa muses on drab dinner fare, ``''
   
   Homer: Okay, okay, where do &lt;you&gt; want to go?
   Lisa:  Anywhere but hamburgers, pizza, or fried chicken!
   Homer: Fine!  We'll go to Mars!
   -- Lisa muses on drab dinner fare, ``''
   
   Marge: Mm, there's that new sushi restaurant on Elm Street...
   Bart:  Sushi?  Hey, maybe this is just one of those things you hear on
          the playground, but isn't that raw fish?
   Lisa:  As usual, the playground has the facts right, but missed the point
          entirely.
   -- Marge suggests the family go to a Japanese restaurant,
      `''
   
 ``Sushi is considered quite a delicacy,'' adds Lisa.
   
   Marge: Please, Homer, can't we try it? [going to a sushi bar]
   Homer: No.
   Lisa:  Please, Dad, this argument humiliates us both.
   Homer: If I said `no' the first time, what makes you think I'm going to
          say `yes' the second time?
   Lisa:  Nothing, but you may say `yes' the ninety-ninth time.
   Homer: Oh?  Try me.
   Lisa:  Please, Dad.
   Homer: No.
   Lisa:  Please, Dad.
   Homer: No.
   Lisa:  Please, Dad.
   Homer: No.
   Lisa:  Please, Dad.
   Homer: No.
   Lisa:  Please, Dad.
   Homer: No.
   Lisa:  Please, Dad.
   Homer: Oh, okay, okay.
   -- If at first you don't succeed, ``''
   
 The family go to the Happy Sumo restaurant and are startled when the
 chefs yell at them in Japanese.  The hostess explains they were merely
 saying Hello.  So Homer yells ``HELLO!'' back at them.
   
   This is our karaoke bar.  Now it is empty, but soon it will be hopping
   with drunken Japanese businessmen.
   -- Restaurant hostess, ``''
   
 The family are seated and their waiter Akira takes their order.  Marge
 asks, ``What would you recommend for a family that's not sure they
 should be here?''  He suggests the `very nonthreatening' sushi samurai,
 and Marge and Lisa order it.
   
   Bart:  Akira, my good man, I'd like two sharks, an octopus and an eel.
   Akira: Very good.
   Bart:  Do you have any giant squid?  The kind that drags men to their deaths?
   Akira: Not today.
   -- At the Japanese restaurant, ``''
   
 Homer has trouble choosing.  ``All looks so terrible.''  He places his
 order.  The Master Chef demonstrates his technique and scolds his
 apprentice.  ``Hang your head in shame.''  The dishes are brought, and
 Homer loves it.

 In the karaoke bar, a gentleman introduces himself.  ``Hi, my name is
 Richie Sakai.  I'm an anaesthesiologist, and I'd like to dedicate this
 next song to my wife, Patti.''  He proceeds to sing.

 Homer eagerly places his next order.  Meanwhile, Bart and Lisa sing `Shaft'
 in the karaoke bar.  Homer looks for something he hasn't tried yet and
 orders fugu.  Akira tries to talk Homer out of it, to no avail.
   
   Come on, pal!  Fugu me!
   -- Homer snaps at Akira the waiter, ``''
   
 The kids continue their singing.  The Master Chef hears a car horn.  ``Ah,
 she's here.  Cover for me.''  After the Master Chef leaves, Akira places
 the fugu order, and the apprentice decides that the preparation of fugu
 should be left to the Master, since one wrong slice and the result is
 fatally poisonous.  The apprentice pays a visit to the parking lot.
   
   Apprentice:  But master, we need your skilled hands.
   Master chef: My skilled hands are busy!
   -- The master chef making the pretzel with Mrs. Krabappel,
      ``''
   
 The apprentice chef studies the chart and carefully prepares the fugu.
   
   Fan-fugu-tastic!
   -- Homer eats some fugu, ``''
   
 The Master Chef returns and finds the blowfish on the cutting table.
 Akira, the apprentice chef, and the Master Chef frantically yell in
 Japanese to Homer.  (``Beautiful language, isn't it Marge?'')
 The apprentice chef tells Homer he may have been poisoned.
   
   No need to panic.  There is a map to the hospital on the back of the menu.
   -- Apprentice chef at the Japanese restaurant,
      ``''
   
 At the hospital, Homer sits on an examining table in his underwear,
 and Dr. Hibbert and Marge come in.  Homer takes a look at Marge's
 sad demeanor and concludes, ``Ooh!  It's good news, isn't it!''  But
 it isn't.
   
   Dr. H: You have twenty-four hours to live.
   Homer: Twenty-four hours!
   Dr. H: Well, twenty-two.  I'm sorry I kept you waiting so long.
   -- Homer learns he's going to die, ``''
   
 Homer embraces Marge.
   
   Well, if there's one consolation, it's that you will feel no pain at all
   until some time tomorrow evening, when your heart suddenly explodes.
   -- Dr. Hibbert explains the consequences of eating tainted fugu,
      ``''
   
   Dr. H: Now, a little death anxiety is normal.  You can expect to go through
          five stages.  The first is denial.
   Homer: No way!  Because I'm not dying! [hugs Marge]
   Dr. H: The second is anger.
   Homer: Why you little! [steps towards Dr. H]
   Dr. H: After that comes fear.
   Homer: What's after fear?  What's after fear? [cringes]
   Dr. H: Bargaining.
   Homer: Doc, you gotta get me out of this!  I'll make it worth your while!
   Dr. H: Finally, acceptance.
   Homer: Well, we all gotta go sometime.
   Dr. H: Mr. Simpson, your progress astounds me.
   -- Homer learns he's going to die, ``''
   
 He leaves Homer a pamphlet, ``So You're Going to Die.''

 [End of Act One.  Time: 7:18]

 That evening in bed, Homer decides not to tell the kids and shows Marge
 the list of things he wants to do on his final day.  He asks Marge,
 ``What's that word you use for when you and I, you know...''  Marge asks,
 ``When we're intimate?''  Homer adds ``Be intamit [sic] with Marge'' to
 his list.  Marge suggests they also get up early and watch the sunrise.
 Homer kisses Marge good-night.

 At 6:00am, the alarm clock goes off, and Homer shuts it off.
 Homer finally wakes up at 11:30am.  He rushes downstairs.
   
   Homer: Marge!  Why did you let me sleep so late?
   Marge: You looked so peaceful lying there.
   Homer: There'll be plenty of time for that!
   -- Homer oversleeps to begin his final day on this earth,
      ``''
   
 He consults his list.  ``Have man-to-man with Bart.''  Homer comes into
 Bart's room.  ``Come here, boy.''  ``Oh, man,'' complains Bart, as he
 drops his pants for a spanking.  But that's not what Homer came in for.
 He tells Bart that (after Homer) he's the man of the house, and Bart
 whines, ``Lisa never lifts a finger, why don't you go yell at her!''
 Homer tells Bart, ``This is &lt;good&gt; stuff!''
   
   I want to share something with you:
   The three little sentences that will get you through life.
      Number 1:  [whispers] Cover for me.
      Number 2:  Oh, good idea, Boss!
      Number 3:  It was like that when I got here.
   -- Homer tells Bart the secret, ``''
   
 ``Hey, this &lt;is&gt; good stuff.''  Homer drags Bart into the bathroom
 to teach him to shave.  Bart's face is lathered as he watches Homer
 finish with ``the little spot under your nose.''
   
   Next, we take some toilet paper, tear off some teensy little squares,
   and stick one there... and there... and any place you're bleeding...
   there... and there... Don't worry, the blood will hold it right on
   your face.
   -- Homer teaches Bart how to shave, ``''
   
 Next comes the after-shave.  Homer slaps it on and screams in pain.
 ``Ooh, ahh, eeh, yaaargh!  Rrrrrr.  Ooh, yargh!  You son-of-a-ohhh!  Eee!''
 ``And that's how we shave.''  Bart accidentally knocks over the
 after shave.  ``Why you little!''  Bart quickly says, ``It was like
 that when I got here!''  Homer embraces him.  ``Oh, that's my boy!''

 Next on the list is listening to Lisa play her sax.  Homer comes into
 Lisa's room, and she offers to stop playing.  Homer asks her to continue.
 Though confused, she does so.  Homer cries at her melancholy music, but
 her tune changes to something more upbeat, and Homer sings and dances.
   
   Oh I want to be in that rumba
   When the saints go over there!
   -- Homer sings to Lisa's sax playing,
      ``''
   
 Next is, ``Make videotape for Maggie.''  Homer pays a visit to Ned Flanders.
   
   Ned:   Simpson, what a pleasant surprise.  We were just pulling taffy.
   Homer: Gee, the fun never stops at the Flanders house, does it.
   Ned:   Heh heh, no sirree-bob!
   -- Homer borrows Ned's camcorder, ``''
   
 Homer borrows Ned's camcorder, and Ned invites Homer's family over for
 a barbecue tomrrow.  Homer declines, then reconsiders...
   
   Homer: I'll even bring the thickest juciest T-bones you've ever seen.
   Ned:   Mm mm.  Sounds terrif!
   Homer: Heh, the joke's on him!  I'll be dead by then!
   -- Ned invites Homer over for a cookout,
      ``''
   
 At home, Homer sets up the camera and begins recording.
   
   Ahem.  This is a videotape for my daughter Maggie.  Hi, Maggie!  I'm
   speaking to you from beyond the grave.  Woooooooo!  Hee hee hee, hope
   that didn't scare you.  Well, Maggie, you're grown-up now, and unless
   you taped over this, you're probably wondering what kind of man
   your father was.  He was a simple man, a kind man, a gentle man who
   loved his children and... [phone rings]  D'oh!  [answers] Hello!
   Yeah, he's here, who is this? [scratches his butt] ... Bart's friend
   Milhouse?  Bart!  Get your butt down here!
   -- Homer tries to make a tape for Maggie,
      ``''
   
 The next item is ``Make peace with Dad''.  Homer pays a visit to Grampa
 at the Retirement Home.
   
   Homer:  Dad, we've never been too close, have we.
   Grampa: Not to my knowledge.
   Homer:  Never once went fishing or played catch or even hugged each other.
   Grampa: We never danced the hootchie-koo, either.  Whatcher point?
   -- Homer reconciles with his father,
      ``''
   
 Homer tells Grampa he loves him, and the two embrace.  Homer says he
 has to go, but Grampa insists they've got a lot of catching up to do.
 Grampa prevails on Homer to go fishing; later, they play catch and
 wrestle.  (While doing these things, Homer crosses things off his list
 he no longer has time to do.)  Homer finally pulls himself away as
 Grampa presses his face against the car window.  ``I love you, son!''
 Mumbles Homer, ``Gee, the old guy's a little love-starved.''
 Hoping to make up for lost time, Homer puts the pedal to the metal,
 but gets pulled over.  He tells the two cops to give him a ticket,
 but they don't take kindly to being ordered around and throw him
 into the slammer.

 [End of Act Two.  Time: 14:10]
   
   Homer: [spots his harmonica-playing cell-mate]
          That's sort of nice.  What are you in for?
   Man:   Atmosphere.
   -- Homer lands in jail, ``''
   
 Homer can't bear to use his one phone call to call Marge, so he calls
 Barney.  But he gets an answering machine.  Homer leaves an angry
 message, and we see that Barney is home, clipping his toenails.  Barney
 quickly picks up.
   
   Homer:  [on the phone] You gotta help me, Barney, I'm in jail.
   Barney: You are?  Hey, Homer, go to the window.
           [waves across the street to Homer]
           Hiya neighbor!  I can see you!
   -- Homer lands in jail, ``''
   
 Homer tells Barney to bring $50 for bail.  (``Whadja do, kill a judge?'')
 Barney hunts around his room to scrounge up $50.  He also finds a slice
 of pizza.  Meanwhile, at home, Marge stares out the front window.
   
   Bart:  Why are we all dressed up?
   Marge: [staring out the window waiting for Homer]
          Because sometimes it's fun to dress up for dinner.
   Lisa:  Why are we using the good china?
   Marge: Because sometimes it's fun to use the good china.
   Bart:  What's with the candles?
   Marge: Sometimes it's fun to use candles.
   Lisa:  Why are we waiting for Dad?
   Marge: Because we love your father and enjoy his company.
   Bart:  Why are we &lt;really&gt; waiting for Dad?
   -- Homer is late for the last dinner of his life,
      ``''
   
 Chief Wiggum counts up the bail money.  (``We don't usually take rusty
 money.'')  Barney drives Homer home and is crushed that Homer isn't
 going to have one last drink with his buddies.  Homer tries to explain
 that there simply wasn't time.  He then spots Burns.
   
   Burns:    [peering through binoculars]
             Smithers!  Check out the luscious pair on that redhead.
             [staring at her red pumps]
             That's it baby, work those ankles!
   Smithers: Ring-a-ding-ding, sir.
   -- ``''
   
   Homer:    Hey Burns!  Eat! my! shorts!
   Burns:    Who the Sam Hill was that?
   Smithers: Why it's Homer Simpson, sir.  One of the schmos from sector 7-G.
   Burns:    Simpson, eh?
   -- ``''
   
 (`Sam Hill' is an old euphemism for `hell'.)  Burns demands to have
 Simpson report to his office at 9 o'clock Monday morning.  Barney
 cajoles Homer into stopping by Moe's.  Homer goes to a pay phone
 to call Marge.  Meanwhile, the bar phone rings.
   
   Moe:  Hello, Moe's Tavern.  Birthplace of the Rob Roy.
   Bart: Is Seymour there?  Last name Butz.
   Moe:  Just a sec.  Hey, is there a Butz here?  A Seymour Butz?
         Hey, everybody, I wanna Seymour Butz! [realizes] Wait a minute...
         Listen, you little scum-sucking pus-bucket!  When I get my
         hands on you, I'm gonna pull out your eyeballs with a corkscrew!
   -- Yet another phone prank, ``''
   
 Homer found that the line was busy.
   
   Moe, another last beer, please.
   -- Homer, ``''
   
 Homer tries to talk, but can't find the words.  He kisses the bar denizens.
   
   Moe:    Please, not in public.
   Man:    You &lt;better&gt; be dying!
   Barney: Whoa!  How European! [belch]
   -- responses from the bar folk to Homer's good-bye kisses,
      ``''
   
 Homer tells Barney to drive him home.  Barney changes a flat tire, and
 Homer can't wait any longer, so he gets out of the car and runs home.
 He arrives home and bangs on the front window.  ``Maaaarge!  Maaaarge!''
 Marge lets him in, and he quickly kisses the kids and dashes upstairs.

 Marge is naked in bed as Homer gargles in the bathroom.  She reads him
 a poem she wrote.
   
   Marge: I wrote a poem for you this afternoon, Homer.  It's called,
          `To a Husband'.
   Homer: Okay, okay.
   Marge: (Ahem.)  The blackened clouds are forming.
   Homer: Oh, give me a break, Marge.
   Marge: Soon the rain will fall.
          My dear one is departing.
          But first, please heed this call.
          That always will I love you,
          My one, my love, my all.
   -- ``''
   
 Homer is touched.

 In the middle of the night, Homer wakes up and tucks in the kids.
   
   Goodbye, Maggie.  Stay as sweet as you are.
   Goodbye, Lisa.  I know you'll make me proud.
   Goodbye, Bart.  ... I like your sheets.
   -- Homer tucks in his children one last time,
      ``''
   
 He goes downstairs and finds a Bible-on-cassette.
   
   Hi, I'm Larry King.
   In the beginning, God created the heaven and the earth...
   -- Bible-on-cassette, ``''
   
 Homer fast-forwards over all the `begets'.
   
   ... lest I come and smite the earth with a curse.
   Well, that's it.  Old Fred [?] is standing by, we'll get some coffee,
   we'll get some matzo-ball soup.  I love the San Antonio Spurs,
   by the way, if you're betting on the NBA this year, I think they'll
   win it all.  So I guess there's nothing more to say but... [closing music]
   -- Bible-on-cassette, ``''
   
 Homer's body goes limp.  A bell tolls.

 Marge wakes up the next morning to find Homer missing from bed.  She
 wanders downstairs and finds Homer's limp body slumped in his chair.  She
 finds drool on his lip, still warm.  She wakes up Homer.  ``You're alive!''
 Grumbles Homer, ``What are you talking about?''  Then he realizes... He's
 alive!
   
   I'm alive!  From this day forward, I vow to live life to its fullest!
   -- Homer realizes he's not dead after all,
      ``''
   
 Homer is planted on the couch, munching on pork rinds, and watching
 bowling on TV.  The credits go up silently over Homer's TV-watching.

 in the living room.
   
   Homer:  You said you'd go the prom with me.
   Marge:  I also said I hated you, and we haven't even talked since then.
   Homer:  I was afraid you'd cancel our date, so I stayed away from
           you completely, even though it meant skipping school
           for three weeks and graduating this summer.  I hope.

 Artie arrives, and Homer leaves dejectedly.  But he insists on going

   you have elected me, your intellectual superior, as your king.  Good for you.

 While Artie and Marge dance, Homer leaves and cries in the hallway.
 Marge asks him why he's putting himself through this, and he explains
 that he thought that they were destined to be together.  Afterwards...
   
   Driver: Well, where to now, Romeo?
   Homer:  Inspiration point.
   Driver: Okay, but I'm only paid to drive.

 At Inspiration Point, Artie starts pawing Marge, and she slaps him when
 he tears her dress.  Marge asks to be driven home.  Homer walks home.
 Marge sees Homer walking along the road as she is driven home.
   
   Artie:  Marge, I would appreciate it
           if you didn't tell anyone about my busy hands.
           Not so much for myself,
           but I am so respected,

 Homer explains, ``I've got a problem.  Once you stop this car, I'm going
 to hug you, and kiss you, and then I'll never be able to let you go.''
 Back to the present, Homer concludes, ``And I never have.''  Lisa is
 touched, but Bart is ready to puke.

   -- Flanders is upset at the cable TV hook-up man,
      ``''
   
 Homer learns the man offered to hook him up to free cable for only $50.
 Homer stops the truck and invites the man in.  When Homer questions the
 properness of his decision, the man gives him a pamphlet.
   
   So you've decided to steal cable.
   Myth: Cable piracy is wrong.
   Fact: Cable companies are big faceless corporations,
         which makes it okay.

   Homer: Nothing a month?  Yeah, I think we can swing that.
   -- The Simpsons have cable!  ``''
   
 When Marge expresses her concern over the legality of stealing cable,
 Homer gives her the pamphlet.
   
   Myth: It's only fair to pay for quality first-run movies.
   Fact: Most movies shown on cable get two stars or less
         and are repeated ad nauseum.
   Hmm I don't know.
   -- Marge reads the `So you've decided to steal cable' pamphlet,
      ``''
   
   TV:    Hear Me Roar, the Network for Women.

          bill in half by making your own band-aids.

          retroactive subsidy appropriations override bill,

 Marge reminds Homer to get ready for church.
   
   Rev. Lovejoy: Now, today's Christian doesn't think he needs God.  He thinks
          he's got it made.  He's got his hi-fi.  His boob tube.  And his
          instant pizza-pie.

         if you actually saw hell, you'd be so frightened, you would die.
   Bart: [raises his hand] Oh, Miss Allbright.
   M.A.: Yes, Bart.
   Bart: Wouldn't you eventually get used to it, like in a hot tub?
   M.A.: No.
   Bart: [raises his hand]

   Bart: Are there pirates in hell?
   M.A.: Yes.  Thousands of them.
   Bart: [rubs hands] Hoo hoo, baby!
   -- Sunday School, ``''
   
 Miss Allbright goes on to say that to avoid eternal damnation, you must
 obey the Ten Commandments.  Lisa is particular frightened by number 8:
 `Thou shalt not steal.'  In the car on the ride home...
   
   Marge:  So, what did you children learn about today?
   Bart:   Hell.
   Homer:  Bart!
   Bart:   But that's what we learned about.
           I sure as HELL can't tell you we learned about HELL

   Bart:   Hell, yes!
   Marge:  Bart!
   Bart:   [singing] Hell, Hell, Hell, Hell, ...
   Marge:  Bart, you're no longer in Sunday School.  Don't swear.
   -- Coming home from church, ``''
   
 Upon returning home, the family settle down to watch more television,
 though Lisa isn't so sure it's right.
   
   Troy:  Hello, I'm Troy McClure.  You may remember me from such movies as
          `Cry, Yuma' and `Here Comes the Coast Guard'!  But today I'd like
          to tell you about a pleasant-tasting candy that actually cleans
          and straightens your teeth!
   Homer: Oh, goodie!  A program-length advertisement!
   Woman: [methodically] Wait a minute, Troy.  I'm a little confused.
          Did you say, cleans &lt;and&gt; straightens?

   Lisa:  So even if a man takes bread to feed his starving family,
          that would be stealing?
   Rev.:  No.  Well, it is if he puts anything on it.  Jelly, for example.
   Lisa:  I see.
   -- A clarification from Reverend Lovejoy,
      ``''
   
 Rev. Lovejoy suggests that she set an example by refusing to watch the
 offending technology.  Meanwhile, Bart learns about the other channels
 available on cable...
   
   TV:    You're watching `Top Hat Entertainment'.  Adult programming
          all day, every day.  (Except in Florida and Utah.)
          Coming up next, `Stardust Mammaries'...
   Bart:  Aye, Carumba!
   Homer: Bart!
   Bart:  Dad!   [He didn't yell `Homer!']
   -- ``''
   
   Son, you shouldn't watch that other channel.  It's only for
   mommies and daddies who love each other very much.
   -- Homer catches Bart watching an adult cable channel,
      ``''
   
 Homer makes Bart promise never to watch that channel again.  Lisa comes home.
   
   Lisa:  Hi, Dad.
          I think stealing cable is wrong,
          so I am choosing not to watch it
          in the hopes that others will follow my example.
          That's the last you'll hear from me on the matter.
          Thank you for your time.
   Homer: Hey, Lisa... `Racing From Belmont'?  Horsies!
   Lisa:  Sorry, I'd rather go to heaven.
   -- Lisa takes the high ground, ``''
   
 That evening in bed...
   
   There's something wrong with that kid.  She's so moral.
   Why can't she be more like ... well, not like Bart...
   -- Homer muses on Lisa's moral posturing,
      ``''
   
 Marge suggests that perhaps they should unhook the cable, but Homer
 refuses to part with it.  So Marge suggests they pay for it, and Homer
 explains, `Look, Marge, I can't afford it.  when I can afford to pay for
 it, I will, but I can't, so I'm not going to.'  (Ah, the song of a pirate.)
   
   The cable stays!  The foot has spoken!
   -- Homer puts his foot down, ``''
   
 [End of Act Two.  Time: 13:36]

 The next day, the cable man comes into the living room as Homer flips
 through the channels...
   
   Homer: Hey, how'd you get in here?
   Man:   Oh, your door wasn't locked in any serious way.
   -- Homer finds a man in his living room,
      ``''
   
 He offers to sell Homer a stolen car stereo, and Homer tosses him out.
 The man offers to see Flanders.  Homer says, ``He's not home.''  The
 man responds, ``Even better...''
   
   Marge, we can't be too careful.  There are thieves everywhere.
   And I'm not talking about the small forgiveable stuff.
   -- Homer installs bars on the windows,
      ``''
   
 Bart invites his schoolmates to watch cable...
   
   Bart:     Come one, come all!  Top Hat Theater is on the air!
             The most beautiful women in the world!
             Just fifty cents!
             I am your host, Bart Simpson!
             (Must be at least eight years old to enter.)
   TV:       And now, the `Top Hat' channel is honored to present...
             `Broadcast Nudes'.
   Gang:     Oooooohh...
   Milhouse: Gross!
   Martin:   Yet strangely compelling...
   -- ``''
   
 Homer catches them.
   
   Man, I wish I was an adult so I could break the rules.
   -- Bart is caught watching a cable porn channel, [Burger King alert!]
      ``''
   
 That evening, people arrive to watch the fight.
   
   Here, I brought some imported generic beer.
   -- Barney brings a gift, ``''
   
   Apu:   Oh, hello, Mrs. Homer.  I brought an assortment of jerkys.
   Homer: Oh, did you swipe those from work?
   Apu:   Certainly not.  What has been implied here?
   -- Apu arrives to watch the fight on Homer's stolen cable TV,
      ``''
   
 The TV pre-fight hype replays an incident from earlier in the day.
 Lisa quietly announces...
   
   I just want to call attention to the fact that I'm not watching
   this fight as my form of nonviolent protest.
   -- Lisa refuses to watch stolen cable,
      ``''
   
 When Moe arrives, Homer frantically hides the mugs he swiped from
 Moe's Tavern...
   
   Hey, go protest outside, will ya?  Now!
   -- Homer yells at Lisa who simply stares at him,
      ``''
   
 ... before opening the door.  Moe's gift is a mug from the tavern.
 Homer then sees Burns and Smithers coming up the walk.
   
   Homer: Quick, Bart!  Hide the stuff I borrowed from work!
   Bart:  Borrowed?
   Homer: All, right, that stuff I stole from work.
   -- Panicking when Mr. Burns arrives, ``''
   
   Will you quit staring at me like that!?
   -- Homer to Lisa who is staring innocently at Homer from outside,
      ``''
   
 Burns arrives and gives Homer `some munchies', a tiny bag of Cheetos.
 Burns' appearance scares some of Homer's guests.  The next visitors are
 the two cops.
   
   Cop:   Word on the street is that you have an illegal cable hookup.
   Homer: No!  No, I... It wasn't me.  It was my wife.  My wife's idea.
          Yeah, yeah, ...
   -- ``''
   
 ... but they just want to watch the fight, too.  Outside, Marge brings
 Lisa some lemonade and moral support.
   
   When you love somebody, you have to have faith that in the end,
   they will do the right thing.
   -- Marge to Lisa, ``''
   
 The pre-fight hype profiles Dreaderick Tatum...
   
   Announcer: The challenger learned how to fight in the notorious province[?]
              of Capital City, and honed his skills while serving time for
              aggravated assault and manslaughter in Springfield Prison.
   Barney:    Awright!  A local boy!
   Tatum:     For five years, I was incarcerated, away from my family, and
              the mothers [sic] of my children...
   -- Watching the pre-fight hype, ``''
   
 Hearing the list of charges against Tatum gives Homer the willies, and
 he envisions himself in jail, isolated from his family.  (He calls,
 ``Marge!  Lisa!  Maggie!''  Bart is conspicuously missing.)  As the
 fight begins, he drags Bart outside.
   
   I hate to interrupt your judging me, but I wanted you to know that
   I've made a couple of really important decisions.
   Number 1: I'm cutting the cable as soon as the fight's over, and
   Number 2: I'm not very fond of any of you.
   -- Homer, ``''
   
   Lisa:  Dad, we may have saved your soul.
   Announcer: [from the TV inside] Tatum is reeling from the champ's
              exquisite hailing...
   Homer: Yeah, at the worst possible time!
   -- Cutting the cable hook-up, ``''
   
 Tatum wins the fight by knockout, and the guests file out.
   
   Apu:   What a donnybrook, eh, Mr. Burns?
   Burns: Oh, hogwash!  Why, I once watched Gentleman Jim Corbett
          fight an Eskimo fellow bare-knuckled for a hundred and thirteen
          rounds!  Back then, of course, if the fight lasted less than
          fifty rounds, we demanded our nickel back!
   -- After watching the big fight, ``''
   
 Later that evening, Homer takes the cable clippers and prepares to
 climb the utility pole.
   
   Dad, I beg you to reconsider.
   Tractor pulls.  Atlanta Braves baseball.  Joe Franklin!
   -- Bart begs Homer not to cut the cable hook-up,
      ``''
   
 Homer reaches the top, and cuts a wire.  Half the lights in Springfield
 go out.  He cuts another wire, and the other half of the lights go out.
 ``Third time's a charm.''  Snip.  Cut to static.

 EPISODE TITLE: Principal Charming


EPISODE SUMMARY: 

 Barney phones Homer early in the morning to tell him about Greasy Joe's
 Bottomless Barbecue Pit.  Homer comes into the living room, where Marge
 is exercising with the television.
   
   Homer: Marge honey, I've got five words to say to you!
          [one word per finger] Greasy Joe's Bottomless Barbecue...
          [realizes he needs his left hand] Pit.
   Marge: Oh, Homey, remember you told me you'd try to limit pork to six
          servings a week?
   Homer: Marge!  I'm only human!
   -- ``''
   
 Homer suggests they dump the kids on Patty and Selma and go to dinner there
 Saturday night.  Marge calls her sisters (at work at the department of motor
 vehicles), who say they have to attend Stanley Peterson's wedding.  But they
 say they'll sneak out early.  A driver fails the eye test.  At the wedding...
   
   Friends, relatives, work-related acquaintances...
   -- Rev. Lovejoy greets the wedding guests, ``''
   
 Selma flashes back to how Stanley had sat down next to her in the cafeteria,
 then Patty arrived and told him to scram.  That evening, Selma sings Lisa
 a sad bedtime song...
   
   Lisa:  Aunt Selma?
   Selma: [grunt]
   Lisa:  Do you think you'll ever married?
   Selma: [sadly] Oh, I don't know.  [perks up]  Why?  You know somebody?
   Lisa:  No.
   Selma: [grunt]
   Lisa:  Since I'm sure you'd only resent the pity of an eight-year-old niece,
          I'll simply hope that you're one of the statistically insignificant
          number of forty-year-old single women who ever find their fair prince.
   -- ``''
   
 Marge and Homer return home, and Homer pops his belt, and more.  He sits
 down on the couch to call Barney, and finds Patty snoring.  Not that it
 bothers him much.  Meanwhile, Selma begs Marge to help her find a husband
 before it's too late.  In bed, Marge cashes in a favor Homer owes her from
 their last family vacation.
   
   Marge: You owe me a favor.
   Homer: [whining] Oh...
   Marge: To be called up whenever and for whatever reason I desire.
   Homer: But that was just an idle promise!
   -- Marge cashes in a favor, ``''
   
 She tell Homer to find Selma a husband.
   
   Homer: Which one's Selma, again?
   Marge: She's the one who likes Police Academy movies and Hummel figurines,
          and walking through the park on clear autumn days.
   Homer: Oh, yeah yeah yeah.  But I thought she was the one that didn't like
          to be ... you know ... touched.
   Marge: It's Patty who chose a life of celibacy.  Selma simply had celibacy
          thrust upon her.
   -- ``''
   
   Marge: You will find her [Selma] a man!
   Homer: [conceding] All right.
   Marge: And not just any man.
   Homer: [annoyed] Okay!
   Marge: He should be honest, and, and caring.  And well-off.  And handsome.
   Homer: Hey!  Why should she have a better husband than you do!?
   -- ``''
   
 Meanwhile, at school, Mrs. Krabappel introduces the class to sodium
 tetrasulfate.
   
   Mrs. K: Sodium tetrasulfate is highly toxic, and can remove your skin.
           [pours into a beaker] Say when... [chuckles]
   Martin: That will do. [Mrs. K stops pouring, and spills quite a bit]
   Bart:   What's this stuff for?
   Martin: It's chiefly used in the manufacture of rayons, film, and
           as a preservative in fast foods.
   -- Chemistry class, ``''
   
 Bart learns that it is also a herbicide.  Meanwhile, Homer wanders through
 the nuclear plant muttering robotically, `Must find man...'
   
   Karl...      Too handsome.
   Smithers...  Jerk.
   Ms. Finch... Not a man.
   -- Homer weighs the pros and cons of potential suitors for his sister-in-law,
      ``''
   
   Boy, a good man really &lt;is&gt; hard to find.
   -- Homer searches for a husband for Selma, ``''
   
 Meanwhile, Principal Skinner scolds Bart and his friends for conspiring
 to all drop their pencils at precisely 2:15pm.  Bart offers to show his
 buddies the work of a true vandal, and pulls out a bag of sodium
 tetrasulfate.   Meanwhile...
   
   One seafood burrito, Apu.
   -- Homer makes a purchase from the Kwik-E-Mart, ``''
   
   Apu...  Pro: Discounted snack treats.   Con:  Dangerous profession.
   -- Homer weighs the pros and cons of potential suitors for his sister-in-law,
      ``''
   
   I am loathe to interrupt your meditation, sir, but the time has come for
   money to change hands.
   -- Apu snaps Homer out of his daze at the Kwik-E-Mart register,
      ``''
   
 The Homer analysis sightings continue...
   
   ?...  Pro:  Nice stride.   Con:  Complete stranger.
   -- Homer weighs the pros and cons of potential suitors for his sister-in-law,
      ``''
   
   Pro:  Smoker.   Con:  Just a sign.
   -- Homer weighs the pros and cons of potential suitors for his sister-in-law,
      ``''
   
 Principal Skinner is eating his lunch...
   
   Say what they will about our cafeteria, I still think they're the best
   tater tots money can buy.
   -- Principal Skinner eats his lunch at school, ``''
   
 He recognizes the smell of ``sodium tetrasulfate bonding with chlorophyll''
 and looks out the window to see the word `BART' written in the grass.  He
 calls Bart into his office.
   
   Principal Skinner: Bart, I'm flabbergasted.  Surely you knew that you were
         writing your own name in forty-foot-high letters on the field, and that
         you would be caught.
   Bart: Maybe it was one of the other Barts, sir.
   Principal Skinner: There are no other Barts!
   Bart: Uh oh.
   -- Another visit to the principal's office, ``''
   
 Skinner contemplates bringing the `Board of Education' out of retirement,
 and tells Bart to call his father.  Bart calls Moe.
   
   Bart: Hello, is Homer there?
   Moe:  Homer who?
   Bart: Homer... Sexual.
   Moe:  Wait one second, let me check. [calls]  Uh, Homer Sexual?  Hey, come on,
         come on, one of you guys has got to be Homer Sexual!  [guffaws from the
         gang]  You rotten liver pot!  If I ever get a hold of you, I'll sink my
         teeth into your cheek and rip your face off!
   -- ``''
   
 Skinner calls Homer into his office and tells him that he's going to
 punish Bart by making him re-sod the field.  Homer's eyes do that funny
 squint...
   
   Principal Skinner...
   Pros:   *  Uses big words.
           *  Dislikes the boy.
           *  [something]
   Cons:   *  Possible Homer Sexual.
   -- Homer weighs the pros and cons of potential suitors for his sister-in-law,
      ``''
   
 Homer learns that Skinner is unmarried and interested in women, so he
 invites him to dinner to pay him back for all the crummy things Bart has
 done to the school.  He accepts.  In the background, Bart slaps his
 forehead.  Homer says, ``Excellent...'' and does that funny thing
 with his fingers.

 [End of Act 1.  Time: 9:15]

 Principal Skinner arrives at the Simpson residence, and the Bouvier twins
 watch nervously from the kitchen.  Skinner tells Homer that he hopes the
 dinner isn't a scheme to introduce him to a woman, but he never finishes
 his sentence.  He sees Patty.
   
   Homer:   Principal Skinner, allow me to introduce you to my wife's lovely
            (and available) sister, Selma.
   Patty:   You bozo, I'm Patty!
   Homer:   What!?
   Skinner: [dreamily] Patty...
   Homer:   D'oh!!  Wrong one!
   -- Homer introduces Principal Skinner to the wrong woman,
      ``''
   
 At dinner, Skinner talks to Patty, who is uninterested, as Selma can only
 watch helplessly.  Skinner invites Patty to a movie.  In the car on the
 way home, Selma tells Patty she is &lt;not&gt; going to cancel the date, seeing
 as it's her first in 25 years.
   
   I tried to repel him, I really did!
   -- Patty to Selma, on Principal Skinner, ``''
   
   Patty: I'll have a Lady Laramie 100's please.
   Selma: We both know it could have easily been me.  Very easily.
          [to Apu] Laramie Hi-Tars, hard pack, and I don't have all day.
   Apu:   Ooh, all right, here you go.  Smoke them in good health.
   -- ``''
   
 The next day, Bart suffers through re-sodding the field, one seed at a time.
 Skinner learns from Bart what sort of candy Patty likes, and tells Bart
 he's free to go.  Marge helps Patty prepare for her date.  Principal
 Skinner arrives, and Patty leaves with him.  ``Let's get this over with.''
   
   I suggest we start with the Springfield Revolving Restaurant.
   You know, food tastes better when you're revolving.
   -- Principal Skinner takes Patty out for a date, ``''
   
 At the restaurant, Skinner recognizes the busboy as a former student.
 Meanwhile, Selma bemoans her fate.  At the movie, Skinner tries a
 schoolboy ploy to put his arm around Patty, with no success.
   
   Principal Skinner: That was the worst movie I've ever seen.
   Patty: Not as bad as the service at the revolving restaurant.
   Principal Skinner: Ho ho ho.  Isn't it nice we hate the same things?
   -- The end of a first date, ``''
   
   Principal Skinner: So, see me again tomorrow?
   Patty:  [grunt] I'm afraid that's my microwave cookery class.
   Principal Skinner: Then the day after that.
   Patty:  Oh, gee.  Tae kwon do.
   Principal Skinner: The day after that, then.
   Patty:  Seymour, you're touching me.
   Principal Skinner: Kiss me, Patty.  I don't have cooties.
   Patty:  Hai-ya!  [gives him a healthy karate (or whatever) chop]
   -- The end of a first date, ``''
   
 Bart learns to take advantage of Principal Skinner's being enamored of Patty.
 After Principal Skinner returns Patty home after another date, she allows
 him one kiss, as Selma watches sadly through the door peephole.

 [End of Act Two.  Time: 15:41]

 At the schoolyard, Bart brags to the gang how Skinner is eating out of the
 palm of his hand.  Skinner catches Bart spraypainting the wall...
   
   Principal Skinner: I'm going to ask for your Aunt Patty's hand in marriage.
   Bart:              It's your funeral, Seymour.
   -- ``''
   
 Homer tells Moe about his current predicament, and Barney offers to date
 Selma.
   
   Wheel her in, Homer.  I'm not a picky man. [belch]
   -- Barney comes to the rescue when Homer needs to find a husband for Selma?
      ``''
   
 Skinner takes Bart to the jewelry store.
   
   Clerk:             A good rule of thumb is two years' salary, sir.  Try this.
   Principal Skinner: I can't afford that, I'm an educator!
   Bart:              Seymour...
   Principal Skinner: I'll take it.
   -- Buying an engagement ring for Patty, ``''
   
 Marge tells Homer she is &lt;not&gt; letting Selma go out with Barney.  Selma
 asks Bart what he learned today, and Bart says what he knows.  Selma
 realizes she can't be picky and decides to take whatever she can get.
 Selma is prettied up for her date, and Barney arrives (complete with
 hovering horsefly and bottle of schnapps).  Meanwhile, Skinner carries
 Patty to the top of the bell tower and removes her blindfold.  Etched
 in the field with sodium tetrasulfate is the phrase, `Marry me, Patty.'
 Patty is flattered, but declines.  (Using logic that still eludes me,
 but then again, since when did logic rule the day in such matters?)
 They bid each other farewell.  Skinner cries, then sees the graffiti
 on the `Springfield Elementary' sign: ``Bart Simpson, Owner and
 Propriator [sic]'.
   
   Oh, Springfield Elementary!  I will have you back again.  After all,
   tomorrow is another school day!
   -- Principal Skinner, ``''
   
 Meanwhile, Barney has taken Selma to Moe's Tavern.
   
   And then when I got out of the service, eh, uh...  Well, the next few years
   are a blur.
   -- Barney, ``''
   
 Patty comes in and tells Selma what happened.  The two leave.
   
   Barney: She broke my heart, Moe. [sobs]
   Moe:    Don't worry, Barney.  Time heals all wounds.
   Barney: [perks up]  Well, whaddya know!  You're right!
           And look, a whole pitcher to myself!
   -- Every cloud has a silver lining?  ``''
   
 The next day, Bart is back, planting grass.

 EPISODE TITLE: Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?


EPISODE SUMMARY: 

 We watch the conclusion of a McBain movie, and Grampa and Jasper boo and
 hiss when it ends.
   
   Grampa:  The screen was too small.
   Jasper:  The floor was sticky.
   Grampa:  The romantic subplot felt tacked-on.
   Jasper:  In short, we demand a refund.
   -- Complaining at the movie theater, ``?''
   
 The clerk tells Grampa, ``Don't have a heart attack, old dude.''
 And Grampa does.  Meanwhile, it is dinnertime at the Simpson residence.
   
   ... and thank you most of all for nuclear power,
   which has yet to cause a single proven fatality.
   At least in this country.  Amen.
   -- Homer, saying grace, ``?''
   
 When Bart sneaks a bite of a green bean during the blessing, he and Lisa
 get into an argument...
   
   Quiet you kids.  If I hear one more word, Bart doesn't get to watch cartoons,
   and Lisa doesn't get to go to college.
   -- Homer, threatening his kids, ``?''
   
 So Bart and Lisa resort to `pantomomime' to communicate.  The dinner is
 interrupted by a phone call from the hospital.  Grampa had a mild heart
 attack.
   
   Grampa: Pull your chair closer, my son.
   Homer:  What is it, Dad?
   Grampa: Peeyoo!  Not that close!  Sheesh.
           Homer, that heart attack made me realize that I'm going to die
           someday.
   Homer:  Oh, Dad, you and your imagination.
   -- hospital visit, ``?''
   
 Grampa tells Homer something he ought to know:  He has a half-brother.
 While he was courting Granma, Grampa went to the carnival to check out
 the skirts...
   
   Hey handsome, wanna `dunk' the `clown'?
   -- Carnival girl/prostitute, ``?''
   
   She did things your mother would never do.  Like have sex for money.
   -- Grampa, remembering an affair, ``?''
   
 When the carnival returned to town a year later, the carnival girl had
 a surprise for him... a baby boy.  The baby was left at the Shelbyville
 orphanage.  When Granma gave birth to Homer...
   
   Granma: Abe, I want Homer to grow up respecting his father.
           He must never know about that, that carnival incident.
   Grampa: Okay.
   Granma: Promise you won't tell him.
   Grampa: I promise.
           [end of flashback]
   Grampa: Oops!  Forget what I just told you.
   -- hospital visit, ``?''
   
   Homer:  This makes me special, Dad.  Since I'm the one you kept, that
           must mean you really loved me.
   Grampa: Mm.  Interesting theory.
   -- hospital visit, ``?''
   
 In the car on the way home...
   
   Lisa:   A long-lost half-brother.  How Dickensian!
   Bart:   So, any idea where this bastard lives?
   Homer:  Bart!
   Bart:   His parents aren't married are they?
           It's the correct word, isn't it?
   Homer:  I guess he's got us there.
   Marge:  Mmm...
   Bart:   [singing]
           Bastard, bastard, bastard, bastard, bastard, bastard, bastard bastard!
   Marge:                         Bart!
   Homer:                                   Bart!             Baart!
   -- car ride, ``?''
   
 Homer pays a visit to the Shelbyville Orphanage, to find that it is now
 a gas station...
   
   Homer:     !
   Attendant: Take it easy, buddy, they moved across the street.
   Homer:     Oh, hee hee.  Sorry.
   -- looking for the orphanage, ``?''
   
 Inside...
   
   Director:  I know how you feel, Mr. Simpson.
              I myself have spent years searching for &lt;my&gt; long-lost twin brother.
   Homer:     Yeah yeah yeah.  Well, I wish I could help you, but we're looking
              for &lt;my&gt; brother today.

   Director:  Your brother could be anywhere.  Even ... Detroit.
   Homer:     I know he could be &lt;anywhere&gt;,
              that's why I want you to narrow it down!  Please!
   Director:  You know, Mr. Simpson, if you ask me, the city of &lt;brotherly&gt; love
              isn't Philadelphia, it's ... Detroit.
   Homer:     Well, if you asked me, changing the subject makes you the
              most worthless, heartless excuse for a human being I ever...
   Director:  Read between the lines, Mr. Simpson!
   Homer:     Oh, I get it!  Okay.  Here's twenty bucks.  Now will you
              tell me where my brother lives?
   -- visit to the orphanage, ``?''
   
 Homer finally learns his brother's name is Herbert Powell, and that he lives
 in Detroit.  Homer goes through a Detroit phone book...
   
   Let's see.  Powell, Powell, Powell...
   Pomerantz, Poole, Popkins, Potter, Quigley, Quimby, Randal, oops, too far.
   -- Homer, looking through the phone book, ``?''
   
 Homer calls all three `Powell, Herbert's in the phone book, with no luck.
 Marge suggests trying to call `H Powell', and he hits the jackpot.
   
   Homer:   Hello?  Hello?  Stupid phone!  [bangs the phone]
   Herbert: Hey, knock it off.  I'm here!
            I'm just silent because of the emotion involved.
   Homer:   Oh.  Sorry.
   -- first contact with his brother, ``?''
   
 Herbert invites Homer to pay a visit...
   
   Bart+Lisa:  Are we there yet?
   Homer:      Just a little further!
   Bart+Lisa:  Are we there yet?
   Homer:      Just a little fur...
   Bart+Lisa:  Are we there yet?
   Homer:      Just a little further!!
   Marge:      Bart!  Lisa!  If you don't behave, we'll turn this car
               right around and go home.
   Homer:      But Marge, I want to see my brother!
   Marge:      Oh, for God sakes, Homer, it's an empty threat.
   -- car ride, ``?''
   
 Homer gets pulled over for speeding, but the trooper apologizes.  ``Sorry
 sir, I didn't know it was you.''  Homer goes to a rest room, and a fellow
 says, ``Wow!  What are &lt;you&gt; doing here?''  The car hits a pothole, and Homer
 spills his drink (D'oh!).  Meanwhile, at Powell Motors...
   
   Herbert:  Every day we're losing ground to the Japanese and I want to know why.
   Advisor:  Oh, unfair trade practices?
   Advisor:  Mushy-headed one-worlders in Washington?
   Advisor:  Some sort of gypsy curse?
   -- board meeting, ``?''
   
   People don't want cars named after hungry old Greek broads!
   -- Herbert Powell, board meeting, ``?''
   
   Herbert: You, what are your roots?
   Advisor: Well, I guess you could say they extend to when the Angles met
            the Saxons... [all except Herbert chuckle]
   Herbert: Or in other words, when white met bread.
   -- board meeting, ``?''
   
 Homer arrives at the Powell mansion, and Herbert steps out of his limo.
 They greet each other emotionally.
   
   Holy moly, the bastard's rich!
   -- Homer, seeing his brother's mansion, ``?''
   
 Homer introduces his family...
   
   Homer:    And our three children:  Bart, Lisa ...
   Maggie:   [falls down]  [thud]
   Homer:    ... and Maggie.
   Bart:     Hello, sir.
   Lisa:     Hello, Mr. Powell.
   Herbert:  All born in wedlock?
   Homer:    [whispers] Yeah, though the boy was a close call.
   -- introducing his family, ``?''
   
 Bart identifies himself as `the little hell-raiser', and Homer tosses
 Maggie into Herbert's arms.  (Maggie instinctively grabs Herbert's tie.)
   
   Herbert:  While you're here, I want you to make yourselves right at home.
             Any time you're hungry, any time day or night,
             Cook will make you anything you want.
   Homer:    Even pork chops?
   Herbert:  Absolutely.  We have a tennis court, a swimming pool,
             a screening room...
   Homer:    If I want pork chops any time in the middle of the night,
             your guy will fry them up?
   Herbert:  Sure, that's what he's paid for.
             Now, if you need towels, laundry, maids...
   Homer:    Wait, wait, wait.  Lemme see if I got this straight.
             It's Christmas Day, 4am, there's a rumble in my stomach...
   Marge:    Homer, please.
   -- touring the estate, ``?''
   
 In the pool, Lisa and Bart play `Marco Polo'...
   
   Herbert: So, Marge, a little about yourself.
   Marge:   Well, I met Homer in high school.  We got married and had three
            beautiful children.
   Herbert: Wow.  We have so much catching up to do.
   Marge:   Mm.  Actually, I just told you pretty much everything.
   -- poolside, ``?''
   
   Bart:   Watch me dive!
   Lisa:   Watch me dive!
   Homer:  OKAY, we're watching!
   Marge:  I hope we're not spoiling them...
           [they dive]
   Bart:   Man, you weren't watching, I did a double gainer with a half...
   Lisa:   Hey, you didn't see what I did, you didn't watch me dive...
   -- poolside, ``?''
   
 Homer calls Grampa ...
   
   A millionaire!?  Ooh, I kept the wrong one.
   -- Grampa learns of his long-lost son, ``?''
   
 Grampa begs Homer, `Please, don't do anything stupid!'  Herbert takes
 Bart and Homer on a balloon ride.
   
   Bart:    Unkie Herb, can I spit over the side?
   Herbert: Heh heh heh.  I love this kid.  Hock your brains out!
            [Bart spits, as does Herbert]
   Bart:    Ho!  Got him!
   -- in a balloon, ``?''
   
 That evening, Homer makes a phone call from bed...
   
   Hello, cook?
   Sorry to bother you so late, but I got a hankering for some...
   That's right.  Don't forget the applesauce!
   -- Homer, on the phone late at night, ``?''
   
 Herbert takes Homer to his garage and offers him any car he wants.  But
 none of the cars is to Homer's liking.  When he confronts his engineers,
 they explain, ``Because Americans don't want'' cars like that.  Herbert
 hires Homer to design a car.
   
   Herbert:  And I want to pay you $200,000 a year!
   Homer:    And I want to let you!
   -- hiring Homer as a consultant, ``?''
   
 Homer is introduced to his team of engineers.  Meanwhile, Lisa wants to
 go on a pony ride, but Bart wants to go on a boat ride, so Herbert decides
 to compromise:  They go for a pony ride on a boat.  At the plant,
 the engineers shoo Homer away.  Homer returns home...
   
   Herbert:  Hey Homer, how's your car coming?
   Homer:    Oh, fine.  They were putting in an onboard something-or-other
             and rack-and-peanut steering.
   -- first day on the job, ``?''
   
   Herbert:  Do you understand?
   Homer:    Sort of.
   Herbert:  Homer?
   Homer:    What.
   Herbert:  Answer me again with self-confidence!
   Homer:    SORT OF!
   -- pep talk, ``?''
   
 Homer goes back to his team of engineers and tells them what he wants.
 Like a place to put his drink.  Not a little cup, but one of those
 super-slurpers at the Kwik-E-Mart.  And all sorts of other amazingly
 tacky things...
   
   Some things are so snazzy they never go out of style!
   Like tail fins... And bubble domes... And shag carpeting...
   -- Homer, designing a car, ``?''
   
 While Lisa and Bart are playing croquet, Herbert gets a call from his
 lead engineer.
   
   Hang up, call me back, and say the exact opposite of everything you just said.
   -- Herbert, to his advisor, ``?''
   
 He then calls Lisa and Bart over and lets them listen to the engineer's
 `modified' report.  Homer continues to throw his weight around the lab...
   
   I want a horn here, here, and here.
   You can never find a horn when you're mad.
   And they should all play `La Cucaracha'.
   -- Homer, designing a car, ``?''
   
   Advisor: What about a separate soundproof bubble-dome for the kids
            with optional restraints and muzzles?
   Homer:   Bullseye!
   -- designing a car, ``?''
   
 And Lisa and Bart introduce Herbert to the wonders of animated cartoons...
   
   Lisa: The mouse is named Itchy and the cat is named Scratchy.
   Bart: They hate each other.
   Lisa: And they're not shy about expressing it.
   -- ``?''
   
   To think I wasted my life in boardrooms, and stockholders meetings,
   when I could've been watching cartoons!
   -- Herbert Powell, watching `Itchy and Scratchy'
      ``?''
   
 At the lab, Homer is hooked up with electrodes and is sent through
 a wind tunnel.  Meanwhile, Marge is concerned that Herbert is spoiling
 the children.
   
   Hello there.  Do you miss the Antarctic?
   -- Lisa, talking to a penguin at the zoo, ``?''
   
 When Homer is shown the plans for his car, he tears it up and draws
 his own.  The moment has come for the grand unveiling...
   
   Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed stockholders,
   members of the press, Your Holiness...
   -- Herbert Powell, ``?''
   
   All my life, I have searched for a car that feels a certain way.
   Powerful like a gorilla, yet soft and yielding like a Nerf ball.
   Now, at last, I have found it.
   -- Homer, describing his car, ``?''
   
 When Herbert learns the monstrosity costs $82,000, Herbert realizes he's
 doomed.  Homer gives the horn a honk, and it plays `La Cucaracha'.
 Herbert's bags are packed as a crane replaces the `Powell Motors' sign
 with `Kumatsu Motors'.
   
   Homer:   Gee Herb, because of me you lost your business, your home, and all
            your possessions.  I can't help but think that maybe you'd have been
            better off if I'd never come into your life.
   Herbert: Maybe I would have been better off?
            MAYBE!
            Why you sponge-head.  Of COURSE I'd have been better off.
            As far as I'm concerned, I have no brother!
   Marge:   Mm.  Maybe he just said that to make conversation.
   -- Herbert leaving forever, ``?''
   
   His life was an unbridled success until he found out... he was a Simpson.
   -- Lisa, ``?''
   
 Grampa arrives, then says, ``D'oh! I knew you'd blow it!''  On the ride
 home, as the car leaves Michigan, Marge and the girls have dozed off...
   
   Bart:  Dad?
   Homer: What is it, boy?
   Bart:  I thought your car was really cool.
   Homer: Thanks boy!  I was waiting for someone to say that.

 EPISODE TITLE: Bart's Dog Gets an F


EPISODE SUMMARY: 

 Homer retrieves his morning paper, which Santa's Little Helper (SLH)
 playfully shreds with his teeth.  Meanwhile, Marge wakes Lisa for school...
   
   Marge:  Mmm, Lisa, you don't look well.
   Lisa:   I'll make it Mom.  Just tape my lunchbox to my hand.
   -- Lisa wakes up ill, ``''
   
 Homer gets up from the breakfast to table to yell at Marge...
   
   Homer:  Maaarge, the dog is hungry.
   Marge:  Well, then, feed him.
   Homer:  Yeees, Master.
   -- Do I have to do everything around here?  ``''
   
 ...but when he returns SLH is gorging himself on `Homer-food'.  Homer locks
 SLH up to a tree outside, and SLH digs up a Krusty doll.  Inside, Marge
 phones Dr. Hibert about Lisa's illness.  Lisa won't go to school today.
   
   Bart:  No way, she's faking!  If Lisa[?] stays home, &lt;I&gt; stay home.
   Lisa:  If Bart stays home, I'm going to school.
   Bart:  Fine, then...  Wait a minute...
          [eyes dart madly as an indication of frantic neural activity]
          If Lisa goes to school, then I go to school, but then Lisa
          stays home, so I stay home, so Lisa goes to school...
   Marge: Lisa, don't confuse your brother like that.
   -- There, I've run rings around you logically.
      ``''
   
   Lisa, you wasted chicken pox.  Don't waste the mumps!
   -- Bart telling Lisa how to enjoy being ill,
      ``''
   
 SLH breaks free from his confines and begins an odyssey through the town
 of Springfield.  He encounters Otto, a hapless ladybug, Apu...
   
   You!  Wandering mongrel!  Get out of my Mom and Pop operation.
   -- Apu shooing Santa's Little Helper away, ``''
   
 ... and a flock of geese.  Sylvia Whitfield phones Homer to complain about
 SLH jumping in her pool.  On the way back from retrieving the dog, Homer
 encounters Flanders, who is wearing ASSASSINS (tm).
   
   You know, they've got the velcro straps, a water pump in the tongue,
   built-in odometer, reflective sidewalls, and little vanity licence plates!
   -- Ned Flanders showing off his `Assassins' sneakers,
      ``''
   
 Dr. Hibert diagnoses Lisa with the mumps.
   
   Dr. Hibert: I guess you'll be missing a week of school, young lady.
   Lisa:       Oh no.  I don't want to fall behind my class.
   Dr. Hibert: Ho ho ho.  Oh, such responsibility for such a little girl.
   -- Lisa is diagnosed with the mumps, ``''
   
 Dr. Hibert, in an attempt at polite conversation, asks Lisa what her
 favorite subject is.  She likes arithmetic.
   
   Take a rest, have yourself a wowwipop.
   -- Dr. Hibert's prescription for the mumps, ``''
   
 Lisa phones Homer (at work) and asks him to pick up some magazines...
   
   Yello?  ...  Hi, Lisa, what's wrong? ... The mumps?  Ooh, the kissing disease.
   -- Homer learns on the phone that Lisa has the mumps,
      ``''
   
 Homer asks Len, ``Cover for me.''  Marge reveals to Lisa the existence of
 a family quilt.  (``It even smells historic.'')
   
   The memory of a million drop stitches flows in your veins.
   -- Marge telling Lisa she is genetically programmed to know how to sew.
      ``''
   
 She threads a needle in a most impressive manner, but Lisa only manages
 to prick her finger when she tries.
   
   You just need to develop a callous.  [pricks her finger and lights a lighter
   under it]  You see?  Now &lt;that's&gt; a sewing finger, honey.
   -- Marge showing Lisa how to sew, ``''
   
 Homer purchases Lisa's magazines (``They're for my daughter.'') but drops
 them when he sees an ASSASSINS (tm) display...
   
   Homer:    Oh, 125 bucks...
             [Flanders appears in a `thought' balloon over Homer's head]
   Flanders: Sometimes, you got to spoil yourself... spoil yourself...
             spoil yourself...
   Homer:    But I can't afford to...
   Flanders: Simpson!  I order you to buy those shoes!
   Homer:    Okay, Flanders, you're the boss!  Heh heh heh.
   -- Homer and his conscience? ``''
   
 Marge and Lisa contemplate a psychedelic patch on the quilt as Bart gets
 home from school.
   
   Bart: Here's your stupid homework.
   Lisa: Ooh.  Phonics, functions, vocabulary, ... remedial reading?
         Oh, do your own homework, Bart!
   Bart: D'oh!
   -- Bart delivers Lisa's homework, ``''
   
 Homer arrives, and Bart is awestruck by his new shoes...
   
   Marge: Those are very elaborate sneakers.
   Bart:  They better be, for 125 big ones!
   Homer:     D'oh!
   Marge:        125 dollars?!?
   Homer:           Bart! [strangles Bart]
   Bart:              Wauuugh!
   Marge:                 Homer!
   Homer:                    D'oh!
   -- Caught in the crossfire, ``''
   
   Marge: I thought we agreed to consult each other before any major purchases.
   Homer: Well, you bought all those smoke alarms, and we haven't had
          a single fire.
   Marge: Mmm...
   -- Homer buys expensive sneakers, ``''
   
 SLH toys with the TV remote control...
   
   As an actor, my eyeballs need to look their whitest!
   -- pitchman Troy McClure on `I Can't Believe They Invented It!'

 ... but gets bored, and seeks new adventure.  He discovers the
 ASSASSINS (tm), and stalks them menacingly.  Homer comes into the room
 and discovers the remains of his sneakers.  Tonight the suburbs of
 Springfield are filled with the sound of a hundred lonely dogs, and one
 bereaved power-plant worker.

 [End of Act One.  Time: 9:06]

 As Homer padlocks SLH to the tree, Marge opens the Yellow Pages...
   
   Marge: Oh, Homer, there seems to be a lot of good obedience schools here.
   Bart:  Oh, school, right, yeah, that's your answer to everything...
   -- finding a school for Santa's Little Helper,
      ``''
   
 Marge chooses a school run by Miss Winthrop.  On the first day of class, she
 demonstrates use of the choke chain.
   
   Martin:         How can we tell if we're doing this maneuver effectively?
   Miss Winthrop:  The dog's eyes will cross, and his tongue will protrude and
                   change color, ever so slightly.
   Bart:           Is my dog dead, Ma'am?
   Miss Winthrop:  Ah ha ha, you don't know how often I'm asked that.
                   `Choke chain' is a misnomer.
                   Trust me.  They are always breathing.
   -- demonstrating the use of the choke chain, ``''
   
 Marge and Lisa watch a (steamy) soap ...
   
   Lisa:  Gee, is it always this good?
   Marge: Mmm.  I don't know.  I just dip in and out.
          I'm only watching today because Randi is coming out of a coma,
          and she knows the phony prince's body is hidden in the boat house.

 ... and discuss the future of SLH as he causes more minor havoc.
 Back in school, Bart tries to get SLH to sit, while a dog walks by with
 a book balanced on its head, and another walks on its hind legs.  The dogs
 are lined up, and they roll over in perfect synchronicity, except for SLH,
 who wets on the rug.  Bart cleans up the mess, accompanied by an appropriate
 tongue-lashing from Miss Winthrop.  Meanwhile, Homer fails to get a refund
 on the ASSASSINS (tm)...
   
   I'm sorry, sir, our warranty doesn't cover fire, theft, or acts of dog.
   -- shoe store clerk, ``''
   
 ... but succeeds in discovering a cookie sale.
   
   Girl:  Aloha!  Would you like a free sample?
   Homer: The price is right!  [stuffs them furiously into his mouth]
          Mmm..  Ooh.. Macamadamia nuts.
   Girl:  If you'd like to buy some, they're only a dollar each.
   Homer: Oh, so &lt;that's&gt; your little plan.  Get us addicted, then jack
          up the price!  [as he talks, cookie crumbs splatter out of his
          mouth, dirtying up his shirt] ... [meekly] Well, you win.
   -- at the Cookie Collossus store, ``''
   
 Homer brings the cookie home, but no sooner has he left it in the kitchen
 than SLH begins to stalk it.  Lisa makes her contribution to the quilt.
   
   Look Mom, I've finished my patch.
   It depicts the two greatest musical influences in my life.
   [cough cough]
   On the left is Mr. Largo, my music teacher at school?
   He taught me that even the noblest concerto can be drained of
   its beauty and soul.
   And on the right is Bleeding Gums Murphy.
   He taught me that music is a fire in your belly that comes out
   of your mouth, so you better stick an instrument in front of it.
   -- Lisa describes her contribution to the Bouvier Memory Quilt.
      ``''
   
 After a good drink from the commode, SLH wanders through the house and
 stalks the quilt.  Marge and Lisa bring Homer upstairs to see the quilt.
   
   Marge: [weeping]  My quilt! Six generations, ruined!
   Homer: Now Marge, honey honey honey.  Come on, come on, don't get upset.
          It's not the end of the world.  We all love that quilt,
          but we can't get too attached to...  OHH!!!  MY COOKIE!!!
   -- Homer tries to console Marge after Santa's Little Helper

   Lisa:  I'm sure Mom agrees with me.
   Marge: Mmm.  No, I'm afraid I agree with your father.
   Homer: You do?  [taunting and dancing]  Ha ha ha ha ha.
   -- what to do about Santa's Little Helper? ``Bart's Dog Gets a F''
   
   Lisa:  This is our pet.  We can question his integrity and disposition,
          but we can't question his heart.  Are you trying to teach us that the
          way to solve a problem with something we love is to throw it away?

          I want you in my corner, honey.

 Marge says the pet can stay if and only if he passes Obedience School.
 At school, SLH refuses to roll over.  Anticipating that the dog will flunk,
 Homer composes a sale ad for SLH.

   See?  He does exactly what I tell him.

 Homer hardsells SLH to a guy on the phone.  Back at school, SLH is unable
 to restrain himself from consuming a Beef Wellington.  A potential customer
 comes by to inspect SLH.  Bart fails to talk Miss Winthrop into letting
 SLH pass, and balks at using the choke chain with the level of force that
 Miss Winthrop prescribes.  Lisa begins a new family quilt, its first panel
 depicting the destruction of the old one.  Bart despairs of training SLH,
 and Lisa suggests they spend their last few hours together in play.  In a
 Lassie-style miracle, this bonding experience breaks down the
 communication barrier between Bart and SLH.  Bart successfully trains SLH.

 Bea Simmons, and the two hit it off.  They eat their pills seductively...
   
   Well, I was wondering if you and I you know, might go to the same place
   at the same time and... Jeez!  You'd think this would get easier with time!
   -- Grampa asks Bea Simmons out, ``''
   
 Grampa preens himself for his date, and they go dancing, and lots of other
 stuff.  Grampa goes to Herman to buy Bea a birthday gift, and Herman points
 him at Grandma's World...
   
   Yo, active wear?  Need a price check on a wool shoal.
   -- Clerk at `Grandma's World', ``''
   
 Homer pays Grampa a visit on the third Sunday of the month, and when Grampa
 says it's his girlfriend Bea's birthday, Homer greets an empty chair
 (thinking Grampa's friend is imaginary) and drags Grampa out.  They take
 him to Discount Lion Safari...
   
   Do not feed the animals.  Do not allow animals inside the car.
   Do not make eye contact with animals.
   -- Lisa reads the instruction pamphlet for Discount Lion Safari, ``''
   
 They wander off the official route, get stuck in the mud, and are attacked
 by lions.  The next morning, the lions are scared off by a gunshot...
   
   Mr. Simpson, I presume.
   -- Very British `Discount Lion Safari' guide, ``''
   
 Grampa returns home to see the paramedics taking Bea's body away.
   
   You know, Jasper, they may say she died of a burst ventricle, but I know
   she died of a broken heart.
   -- Grampa mourns Bea's passing, ``''
   
 At the funeral...
   
   You can tell she really cared for me.  She didn't make me a pallbearer.
   -- Grampa watches the pallbearers struggle with the casket, ``''
   
   Homer:  I can't tell you how sorry I am, Dad.
   Grampa: Is someone talking to me?  I didn't hear anything.
   Homer:  Oh no!  Dad's lost his hearing!
   -- Grampa disowns Homer, ``''
   
 In his room, Grampa is greeted by Lionel Hutz, the executor of Bea's estate,
 and learns she left everything to him.
   
   Hutz:   There is one catch...  You must spend one night in... a haunted house!
   Grampa: [gasp!]
   Hutz:   Just kidding.
   -- Grampa inherits $106,000, ``''
   
   Why don't I just give you this pen with my phone number on it.  It looks
   just like a cigar.  Isn't that something!
   -- Lionel Hutz leaves a calling card, ``''
   
 Grampa phones Homer to tell him he isn't getting one thin dime.  The
 home director makes a play for the money, and Grampa throws him out.
   
   Grampa:   Has it ever occurred to you that old folks deserve to be treated
             like human beings! whether they have money or not?
   Director: Yes, but it passes.
   -- The retirement home director tries to get his hands on... ``''
   
 Grampa returns to Herman's and buys a fez, allegedly once worn by Napoleon.
 He goes to various `exciting' places and yawns at each.  While at
 Dis-nee-land ...
   
   Oh, Abraham, calm down.  I'm not here to scare you.  They've got me haunting
   a family in Texas.
   -- Bea's ghost appears, ``''
   
 She suggests that, since he isn't enjoying the money, he give it to a worthy
 cause.  Meanwhile, Marge suggests that Homer talk to somebody about his
 depression...
   
   Hiya.  You have reached Doctor Marvin Monroe's anxiety line.
   If you have a sullen teenager, press `1'.. NOW!
   If you are estranged from your spouse, press `2'... NOW!
   If you have trouble maintaining an...
   -- ``''
   
 Grampa pays a surprise visit, and the two reconcile.  Over dinner, Grampa
 announces that he's going to interview for worthy causes for Bea's money.
 Outside the retirement home, Kent Brockman does his news report.  Inside
 Grampa listens to pitches from Otto, Mr. Burns, Moe, Dr. Marvin Monroe...
   
   Monroe: It's a special isolation chamber.  The subject pulls levers to receive
           food and water.  The floor can become electrified, and showers of
           icy water randomly fall on the subject.  I call it... The Monroe Box!
   Grampa: Uh huh.  Sounds interesting.  How much will it cost to build?
   Monroe: Oh, that's the beauty part!  It's already built!  I need the money
           to buy a baby to raise in the box until the age of thirty.
   Grampa: What are you trying to prove?
   Monroe: Well, my theory is that the subject will be socially maladjusted and
           will harbor a deep resentment towards me.
   Grampa: Mm.  Interesting.
   -- Everybody wants to get their hands on... ``''
   
 from Bart, a crazy inventor with a death ray...
   
   Man:    With proper funding, I'm confident this little baby could destroy
           an area the size of New York City.
   Grampa: But I want to help people, not kill them!
   Man:    Oh.  Well, to be honest, the ray only has &lt;evil&gt; applications...
   -- Everybody wants to get their hands on... ``''
   
 and even Lisa...
   
   Lisa:   The people who deserve it are on the streets, and they're in the slums.
           They're little children who need more library books, and they're
           families who can't make ends meet.  Of course, if you really wanted
           to, you could buy me a pony.
   Grampa: You're right!
   Lisa:   I'll name her Princess, and I'll ride her every day!
   -- Lisa suggests how Grampa could spend his... ``''
   
 Grampa realizes Lisa is right and takes a walk through the run-down part
 of town.  He returns to the retirement home and realizes that $100,000
 isn't enough.  Jasper suggests going to the casino.  While Otto drives
 the bus of old elderly folk, Homer chases after it.  As Grampa changes
 his money into chips, Homer pulls into a Krusty Burger...
   
   Homer: A double cheeseburger, onion rings, large strawberry shake, and
          for God's sakes, hurry!
   Voice: [unintelligible, thanks to the poor-quality microphone]
   -- The drive-through window of a Krusty Burger, ``''
   
 Homer arrives at the casino and finds that Grampa is actually winning.
   
   Grampa: I think Rudyard Kipling said it best:  If you can make one heap
           of all your winnings and risk it all on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
           and lose, and start again at your beginnings, and never breathe
           a word about your loss, yours is the earth is everything that is
           in it, and, which is more, you'll be a man, my son.
   Homer:	You'll be a bonehead!
   -- Trying to stop Grampa from risking it all at the casino, ``''
   
   Grampa: Put it all on 41.  [nudges Homer] I've got a feeling about that number.
   Roulette man:  The wheel only goes to 36.
   Grampa: Okay, put it all on 36.
           [nudges Homer] I've got a feeling about that number.
   -- Grampa at the casino, ``''
   
 Homer successfully stops Grampa from risking (and losing) everything.
 Grampa sees his friends piling onto the bus for the ride home and decides
 where his money should go:  He spends it on sprucing up the Springfield
 Retirement Castle and creating the Beatrice Simmons Dining Room.

   -- The persistence of memory? ``''
   
 Homer has trouble fitting into his swimsuit (which doesn't leave much to
 the imagination), nor does he find it easy to get into the car without
 his spare tire hitting the horn.  When they arrive...
   
   Everybody stick together.  We don't want to get separ...

 Bart is pleased that there is no line, but he's mistaken.
   
   Bart: Okay, Lis.  Turn on the water works, babe.

   -- How to get to the front of the line for a ride at Mt. Splashmore,

 Lisa, then Bart go down.  Marge watches Maggie in the kiddie pool.
 Homer gets to the front of the H2WHOA line by claiming to be the
 line inspector, and when he goes down, he gets stuck.  One technician
 notes, ``It's too big to be human'' and tells the spotter to send
 down some kids to dislodge it.  They don't, and the section of pipe
 has to be removed to get Homer out.  The family watch the TV news.
   
   Eyewitnesses estimate the man's weight at somewhere between four and
   five hundred pounds.
   -- Newscaster on Homer's getting stuck in the water slide,
      ``''
   
   Krusty: [surrounded by reporters]
           No, this slide is perfectly safe.  This was an isolated incident.
   Kent Brockman:  I understand that Krusty... [lost in the reporters' yelling]
           Krusty!  Was that exactly what you said just before the recall of
           tainted `Krusty Brand Mayonnaise'?
   Krusty: Now kids, you know that question is out of bounds.
           This interview is over.

   Homer:  All right, family.  I want the truth.  Don't pull any punches.

           [angrily] Well, am I?
   Lisa:   Forgive us, Dad, but it takes time to properly sugar-coat a response.
   -- Ooh, and a split infinitive, too, ``''
   
 Homer weighs himself.
   
   Oh!  Four hundred and thirty-seven...  Fifty pounds?
   Oh my God!  Three hundred and...  A hundred and fifty?
   OH! Ooh. OH! Ooh.
   Oh my God!  It's two hundred and sixty pounds!
   I'm a big fat pig!
   -- The ups and downs of dieting with a shaky scale, ``''
   
   Marge: You do have big bones.
   Homer: Marge, no one gains thirty pounds of bones!

   I am going on a diet.
   From this day forward, I pledge there will be no pork chop too succulent!
   No donut too tasty!

   As God as my witness, I'll always be hungry again!!

 then his stomach growls. [End of Act 1.  Time: 5:38]

 Homer takes Bart up to the attic, where Bart scares Homer with the lights.
   
   Bart:  Hey, Homer, I found your weights.
   Homer: [admiring] Oh, the Glutemus Maximizer...
   -- Up in the attic, ``''
   
 Bart stumbles across a large cache of paintings of Ringo Starr, signed
 by `Marge B.', one of which depicts Ringo and Marge getting married.
 Homer confronts Marge.
   
   Marge: Oh Homer, don't be jealous.  I was a schoolgirl.
          The Beatles were very popular, and I had a crush on him.
   Homer: A likely story...
   -- Marge explains her collection of Ringo Starr paintings,
      ``''
   
 At dinner...
   
   Oh, why did I have to start my diet on pork chop night?

 Marge gives Homer steamed vegetables and rice cakes.
   
   Hey, I've been setting my drinks on these things!
   -- Homer admires a rice cake, ``''
   
   Hello!  Hello!  Hello, taste?  Where are you?
   -- Homer bites into a rice cake, ``''
   
 Marge suggests Homer could put something on it for flavor.
   
   Hey Mom, these paintings are good.
   While I know first-hand how fragile young talent is,
   I'd love to hear the particulars of how &lt;your&gt; gift was squashed.
   -- Lisa asking Marge to explain her schoolgirl painting talent,
      ``''
   
 Marge tells her story of how Mr. Schindler scolded her for drawing Ringo,
 and how she sent Ringo a picture of him for an honest opinion.  But she
 never got any response and never painted again.
   
   Lisa:  Maybe you could take a class at Springfield Community College.
   Marge: I think it's a very nice idea.  Don't you, Homer?
   Homer: Do I have to do anything?
   Marge: No.
   Homer: Great!  Fine!  Go nuts!

 Homer takes his rice cake out of the microwave, loaded with goodies.

 With Lisa's moral support, Marge shows Prof. Lombardo her portfolio
 and he lets her enrol in the painting class.
   
   Marvelous!
   -- Prof. Lombardo sees a handyman paint the handrail, ``''
   
 Homer is wearing weights on his wrists and ankles, and he can't move.
 Bart takes advantage of the situation and takes Homer's wallet.  Back
 at SCC...
   
   Now, using the Lombardo method, you learn to see everyday objects
   as a simple grrouping of geometrical shapes.  Heah, we see how two
   concentric circles, various trapezoids, ellipses, and yes! even a rrhombus!
   can create an adorable little bunny-rabbit.  It's just that easy!
   -- Professor Lombardo's art lecture, ``''
   
 Homer tries to lift weights, he skips rope with Bart and Lisa (as Marge
 `visualizes' him geometrically), and he tries a second time to lift
 weights, and suceeds after all the weights fall off and he raises just the
 bar.  At SCC...
   
   Bravo!  Walk away from it.  Now it belongs to the ages.
   [to next student]
   You!  Not another stroke!  Oh well, maybe one more, that's it!  Perfect!

 Prof. Lombardo is very impressed with Marge's work and enters her `Bald
 Adonis' in the Springfield Art Exhibition.

   Oh!  Another triumph!

 At the art show, Marge wins first prize.  At the power plant, Burns
 bawls out yet another artist hired to paint his portrait for the
 opening of the Burns Wing of the museum.  Smithers discards the painting
 into a room filled with other failed paintings.
   
   Damnation, Smithers.  This idea of yours to immortalize me in a portrait
   was as half-baked as your idea about me having children!
   -- Burns chews out Smithers, ``''
   
 Smithers notes that Burns has alienated every artist in town.  Then suggests
   
   Smithers: Mrs. Homer Simpson.
   Burns:    Who?
   Smithers: She won first prize in the Springfield Art Fair,
             and she's the wife of an employee, she'll be easily
             intimidated.
   Burns:    Excellent.

 Homer weighs himself again (again with a shake scale), and he weighs 249.
 He comes down and announces it to the family.
   
   Marge:  That's wonderful, isn't it kids?
   Lisa:   [to Bart] Pass the moo juice.
   Marge:  Kids, remember what I told you about showing a little support?
   Lisa:   Way to go, Dad!

 At the plant...
   
   Donut man:  Hey, what gives?  These donuts are piling up.
   Worker:     Heh.  Yeah, Homer Simpson went on a diet.
   Donut man:  Oh my God.  And I just bought a boat! [slaps forehead]
   -- Homer's diet depresses the local economy, ``''
   
 Burns struggles to rap the knocker on the Simpsons' door, and Smithers
 bangs on the door until Marge answers.  They invite themselves in.
   
   Smithers:  Have you ever painted the rich and powerful?
   Marge:     Well, no.  Just Ringo Starr.
   Burns:     Ring-Go?
   Smithers:  He was the drummer for a rock-and-roll combo called
              the Beatles, sir.
   Burns:     Beatles, eh?  Oh, yes.  I seem to remember their off-key
              caterwauling on the old Sullivan show.  What &lt;was&gt; Ed thinking?

 Burns requires that Marge make him look beautiful, and she agrees.
 Posing for the portrait...

   Burns:    [trying to get him to shut up]  Yes, yes, yes.
   -- Preparing for a portrait, ``''
   
 Homer arrives home and panics when he sees Burns.  He takes Marge into
 the kitchen and begs her to make him look handsome.  Marge assures Homer
 that all she needs to do is find his inner beauty.  She returns to work.
   
   Marge:  What were you like as a boy, Mr. Burns?
           Did you have a dog that you loved?
   Burns:  Well...  Daah!  There's something on my leg.  [waves his leg]
           Get it off!  Get it off!  [Maggie is clutching his leg]  Ugh!

 While collecting laundry, Marge accidentally bursts in on Burns

 In the kitchen...
   
   Burns:    [off camera]  Smithers!  I want my tea!
   Marge:    Doesn't it bother you that he orders you around like that?
   Smithers: Oh ho ho.  Actually, I value every second we're together.
             From the moment I squeeze his orange juice in the morning,
             til I tuck him in at night.
             He's not just my boss.  He's my best friend, too.

 Meanwhile, somewhere in England...  Ringo is surrounded by bags of
 mail with the word `mail' on them, in various languages.

 Homer steps onto the scale, and he weighs 239 pounds.

 Marge sends Burns away, then stops Homer from spraying whipped cream
 directly into his mouth.  Marge has lost faith in her painting
 ability.  A letter comes in for Marge...
   
   Dear Marge.  Thanks for the fab painting of Yours Truly.  I hung
   it on me wall.  You're quite an artist.  In answer to your question,
   yes, we do have hamburgers and fries in England.  But we call French
   fries `chips'.  Love, Ringo.  PS: Forgive the lateness of my reply.

 Homer tells Marge she can do it, and she sets to work.  Marge paints

 At 9:15am, while Lisa reads a book, her classmates are throwing things
 around the classroom.
   
   1: Did you hear about Miss Hoover?
      She drank a bottle of drain cleaner by mistake.
   2: Oh, I heard she fell down a well.
      [Principal Skinner comes in with Miss Hoover, who is crying]
   Lisa:  My God, she's been dumped again...
   -- ``''
   
   Miss Hoover: [shakily] Children, I won't be staying long.
                I just came from the doctor, and I have lyme disease.
                Principal Skinner will run the class until a substitute arrives.
   Ralph:       What's lyme disease?
   Pr. Skinner: I'll field that one.  [goes to blackboard]  Lyme disease
                is spread by small parasites called `ticks'.  [writes `TICKS'
                on blackboard]  When a diseased tick attaches itself to
                you, it begins sucking your blood...
   Miss Hoover: [not calmed] Oh...
   Pr. Skinner: Malignant spirochetes infect your bloodstream, eventually
                spreading to your spinal fluid and on into the brain.
   Miss Hoover: The brain!?  Oh, dear God...
   Class:       Wow!
   -- ``''
   
 Until the substitute teacher arrives, Principal Skinner teaches the class.
   
      [a scream is heard from the room above]
   Skinner:  Bart Simpson!  I know it's you!
   -- Principal Skinner fills in for Miss Hoover, ``''
   
 For Show-and-Tell, Bart shows a videotape, titled, `How kittens are born:
 The UGLY story'.
   
   Oh look, this is really cool.  When I hit reverse, I can make them go back in!
   -- Bart shows a videotape of kittens being born, ``''
   
 Back downstairs, Principal Skinner teaches the class about the schwa.
   
   Bergstrom: [enters the classroom, guns ablazin']
   Skinner:   Are you the substitute?
   Bergstrom: Yessir, yes I aim.
   Skinner:   Are you insane?
   -- Principal Skinner doesn't quite get Bergstrom's unorthodox teaching
      technique, ``''
   
 Mr. Bergstrom takes over and asks the class to find three things wrong
 with his costume.  Lisa raises her hand and lists them.  Her third point
 was that Mr. Bergstrom appears Jewish, but there were no Jewish cowboys.
 Mr. Bergstrom rewards her with his hat, though he intended the third
 point to be that he is wearing a digital watch.
   
   And, for the record, there were a few Jewish cowboys, ladies and gentlemen.
   Big guys who were great shots and spent money freely.
   -- Mr. Bergstrom's lesson on the American West, ``''
   
 Mr. Bergstrom introduces himself and suggests ways the class could make
 fun of his name.  Ms. Krabappel begins the process of electing a class
 president, and she endorses Martin, who gives his nomination speech.
   
   Martin: As your president, I would demand a science-fiction library,
           featuring an ABC of the over[something] genre.  Asimov,
           Bester, Clarke!
   Student: What abouy Ray Bradbury?
   Martin: [dismissing]  I'm aware of his work...
           [orating] Thank you, and... Keep watching the skies...
   -- Martin's campaign speech for class president, ``''
   
 During the cookie break, Mr. Bergstrom sings `Home on the Range'
 (with editorial commentary) to the class, and the kids pass to Lisa a
 picture of `the singing dork'.  Mr. Bergstrom catches Lisa with it.  She
 insists she didn't draw it, though that doesn't seem to bother him.  The
 kids then pass to her a picture of `the singing dorkette'.

 Sherri and Terri nominate Bart to run against Martin, and Ms. Krabappel
 sends Bart out of the room.  Bart does the blowfish on the door window.
 Downstairs, Mr. Bergstrom finishes reading &lt;Charlotte's Web&gt; to the class.
 Later, he asks the students in turn to demonstrate their special talent.
 When it's Lisa's turn, he asks about her saxophone, but she refuses to
 play it.  After school, Lisa eavesdrops on a conversation and sees
 Mr. Bergstrom spurn Ms. Krabappel's advances.  Lisa sighs admiringly.
 Outside on the playground, Lisa plays her sax for Mr. Bergstrom,
 who watches from the classroom window.

 [End of Act One.  Time: 6:52]

 While helping Marge fold the laundry, Lisa gushes about her crush on
 Mr. Bergstrom and has trouble believing that Marge feels the same way
 about Homer.  Homer and Bart make fun of the fact that Mr. Bergstrom
 cried when he read the end of &lt;Charlotte's Web&gt;.

 At school, Lisa's class is dismissed for lunch, and Mr. Bergstrom calls
 Lisa aside.
   
   Mr. Bergstrom: Lisa, your homework is always so neat.
         How can I put this?  Does your father help you with it.
   Lisa: No.  Homework's not my father's specialty.
   -- ``''
   
 Lisa is not very flattering in her description of Homer.  Meanwhile,
 the campaign for class president continues.
   
   Martin: [campaign speech]  In a sample taken in this very classroom,
           a state inspector found 1.74 parts per million of asbestos!
   Bart:   That's not enough!  We demand MORE asbestos!
           [leads the class in a chant of `MORE ASBESTOS']
   -- Martin and Bart run for class president, ``''
   
 The campaign confrontation makes the front page of `The Daily Fourth Grader',
 headlined, ``Bart to Martin:  Eat my shorts!''
   
   Homer: Wow!  You made the front page!
   Bart:  Aw, Dad, it's just a popularity contest?
   Homer: JUST a popularity contest?
          Excuse me.  What's more important than popularity?
   -- Bart runs for class president, ``''
   
   I always knew you had personality.
   The doctor said it was hyperactivity, but I knew better.
   -- Homer is pleased that Bart's running for class president,
      ``''
   
 Homer inspires Bart to ``Go get 'im!''  The campaign continues...
   
   He says there aren't any easy answers.
   I say, he's not looking hard enough!
   -- Bart's campaign speech against Martin, ``''
   
   Martin's Poster:  A Vote for Bart is a Vote for Anarchy!
     Bart's Poster:  A Vote for Bart is a Vote for Anarchy! [scrawled]
   -- The campaign for class president, ``''
   
 Homer helps Bart make a campaign poster:  ``Sex!  Now that I've got your
 attention, vote for Bart!''  And on the playground, Bart hold up one
 of Martin's campaign flyers and wipes the seat of his pants with it.
 Lisa and Mr. Bergstrom watch from the classroom window.
   
   You'll never go broke appealing to the lowest common denominator.
   -- Lisa comments on Bart's campaign antics, ``''
   
 Mr. Bergstrom tells Lisa that she'll miss her brother when she goes on to
 better things.  Lisa says she believes everything he says.

 The class write get-well letters to Miss Hoover, and when class is
 dismissed, Mr. Bergstrom mentions that the Springfield Museum of Natural
 History is closing due to lack of interest, and urges that they go see it
 while they can.  At home...
   
   Marge: Lisa needs to go to the museum tomorrow,
          and I think you should take her.
   Homer: Museum?  Tomorrow?  Oh, oh, Marge, I'd love to, but I was planning
          on... [thinks to himself] Sleeping?  Eating a big sandwich?  Watching
          TV?  Spending time with the boy! [speaks up]  Spending time with the
          boy!  The boy needs attention, Marge.
   Marge: Homer, I've been talking to Lisa, and I'm concerned about your
          relationship with her.
   Bart:  Me too, Mom.  I think you're drifting apart.
   Homer: Shut up, boy.
   Marge: Homer, please.
   Homer: Marge, you don't understand.  I can't do it because...
          [thinking to himself] You're trapped.  If you were smarter, you
          might think of something.  But you're not, so you just might as
          well... [speaks up]  All right, all right, I'll take her.
          [sotto voce]  Lousy brain.
   -- ``''
   
 Homer takes Lisa to the museum and sees the sign,
 `Suggested donation: $4.50'.
   
   Homer: Eh, what do you mean by `suggested donation'?
   Clerk: Pay any amount you wish, sir.
   Homer: And uh, what if I wish to pay ... zero?
   Clerk: That is up to you.
   Homer: Ooh, so it's up to me, is it?
   Clerk: Yes.
   Homer: I see.  And you think that people are going to pay
          you $4.50 even though they don't have to?
          Just out of the goodness of their... [laughs]
          Well, anything you say!  Good luck, lady, you're gonna need it!
   -- Homer sees the sign `Suggested donation: $4.50' at the museum entrance,
      ``''
   
 Mr. Bergstrom coincidentally arrives, and he joins Homer and Lisa.
 Mr. Bergstrom lectures on dinosaurs and mummification...
   
   Ooh, pretty creepy.  Still, I'd rather have him chasing me than the Wolf Man.
   -- Homer admires the mummy at the museum, ``''
   
 While Homer admires, Lisa leaves with Mr. Bergstrom.

 At the museum snack bar, while Lisa entertains herself with a static
 electricity demonstration, Mr. Bergstrom tells Homer that Lisa needs
 a strong male role model.
   
   She looks around and sees everybody else's dad with a good education,
   youthful looks, and a clean credit record, and thinks, ``Why me?  What
   did I do to deserve this fat old piece of...'' [cries]
   -- Homer talks to Mr. Bergstrom on Lisa's need for a strong male role model,
      ``''
   
   Mr. B: There is a wonderful girl's future at stake.
   Homer: Well, if she's so wonderful, give her an A!
   Mr. B: I &lt;am&gt; giving her an A.
   Homer: Great, but don't tell her it was a favor to me.  Tell her she earned it.
   Mr. B: Mr. Simpson, she &lt;did&gt; earn it.
   Homer: You are smooth, I'll give you that.
   -- On Lisa's education, ``''
   
 Homer joins Lisa at the static electricity exhibit.

 At home, Lisa tells Marge that Homer ruined her one chance to get to
 know Mr. Bergstrom outside of school.
   
   Marge: Why don't we invite Mr. Bergstrom to dinner?
   Lisa:  Oh, Mom!  That's wonderful!
          Can I find out his favorite dish and help you make it?
   Marge: Sure.
   Lisa:  Can I wear your jewelry?
   Marge: Sure.
   Lisa:  Can I get my ears pierced?
   Marge: No.
   Lisa:  Can I dye my shoes pink?
   Marge: Yes.
   Lisa:  Can I paint my nails?
   Marge: No.
   Lisa:  Can we have wine?
   Marge: Yes.
   Lisa:  Can I have wine?
   Marge: No.
   Lisa:  Does Bart have to be there?
   Marge: Yes.
   Lisa:  Can we do it this week?
   -- Setting the ground rules, ``''
   
 Outside the classroom door, Lisa rehearses inviting Mr. Bergstrom to dinner.
 But when she comes in, she sees Miss Hoover erasing Mr. Bergstrom's name
 from the blackboard...  ``Good morning, Lisa.  I'm back.''

 [End of Act Two.  Time: 13:22]
   
   Miss Hoover: You see, class, my lyme disease turned out to be
                [spells it on the board] psychosomatic.
   Ralph:       Does that mean you're crazy?
   Student 2:   No, that means she was faking it.
   Miss Hoover: No, actually, it was a little of both.
   -- Miss Hoover returns to teaching, ``''
   
 Miss Hoover is miffed that Mr. Bergstrom didn't touch her lesson plan
 and asks what he taught the class.  Lisa says, ``That life is worth
 living,'' and rushes out of the classroom in tears.  Ms. Krabappel
 announces that the polls will be open until the end of recess.  The
 candidates are invited to make their final statements.  Martin is too
 shaky to say much of anything.  Bart announces, ``Victory party under
 the slide!''

 Lisa arrives at Mr. Bergstrom's apartment, but he moved out, having
 gotten an assignment in Capital City.

 At recess, Bart hands out cupcakes, but learns that nobody actually
 voted.  Not even Milhouse or Lewis.  When the bell rings, Bart realizes
 that &lt;he&gt; forgot to vote.

 In the classroom, Martin and Wendell jump for joy.
   
   Bart:  I demand a recount!
   Ms. K: [counts the votes] One for Martin.  Two for Martin.
          Would you like another recount?
   Bart:  [realizing he's beat] No.
   Ms. K: [enjoying it]  Well, I just want to make sure.
          One for Martin.  Two for Martin.  [chuckles]
   -- The Apathy Party loses again, ``''
   
 At the train station, Lisa catches Mr. Bergstrom as he's about to board
 the train to Capital City.  Lisa begs him not to leave.
   
   That's the problem with being middle-class.
   Anybody who really cares will abandon you for those who need it more.
   -- Mr. Bergstrom's parting remarks, ``''
   
 Lisa tearfully understands.  He tells her, ``Whenever you feel that you're
 alone and there's nobody you can rely on, this is all you need to know,''
 and hands her a note.  Lisa chases the train as it pulls away, then looks
 at the note.  It reads, ``You are Lisa Simpson.''

 At the dinner table ...
   
   Bart didn't get one vote?
   Oh, this is the worst thing that could ever happen to us!
   -- Homer, on Bart failing to be elected class president, ``''
   
 Lisa is upset about Mr. Bergstrom's leaving.
   
   Hey, just because I don't care doesn't mean I don't understand!
   -- Homer tries to understand Lisa, ``''
   
 Lisa finally snaps...
   
   Lisa:  You, sir, are a baboon!
   Homer: [gasp] Me?
   Lisa:  Yes, you!  Baboon!  Baboon!  Baboon!  Baboon!
   Homer: I don't think you realize what you're saying...
   Lisa:  BABOON! [leaves in tears]
   Bart:  Whoa.  Somebody was bound to say it someday, I just can't believe
          it was her.
   -- ``''
   
 Marge tells Homer to talk to Lisa.  Ignoring the `Go Away' sign on her door,
 Homer tries to cheer Lisa up, with no success.  He makes a `monkey' joke and
 dances around the room like a gorilla.  This works.  Homer goes to Bart,
 who is upset at having lost the election.  But Homer points out that the
 class president has to do extra work and doesn't get to do anything neat.
 This works.  He then goes to Maggie's room and giver her her pacifier.
 He comes downstairs to the kitchen, and stops Marge from talking.
 ``Let's just go to bed.  I'm on the biggest roll of my life.''

 EPISODE TITLE: War of the Simpsons


EPISODE SUMMARY: 

 Marge puts the finishing touches on the party preparations.
   
   Mmm... Horse doovers...
   -- Homer helps himself to the party snacks, ``''
   
   Marge: [slaps Homer's hand] Homer!  You promised.
   Homer: I promised I wouldn't eat?  Never!  You lie!
   -- Homer helps himself to the party snacks, ``''
   
 Marge explains that they're throwing a party to pay back all the
 friends who had invited them over.
   
   Homer: Never thrown a party?  What about that big bash we had with all
          the champagne and musicians and holy men and everything?
   Marge: That was our wedding!
   Homer: Oh.
   -- pre-party discussion, ``''
   
 Marge sends the kids to bed, though Lisa wants to hear the witty banter
 of sophisticated adults, and Bart complains, ``You can't have any
 fun in bed.''  Homer chuckles, ``When you're older, you'll know better'',
 and thinks of eating a hoagie in bed.   The doorbell rings.
   
   Marge: Oh, they're here.  How does everything look?
   Homer: Yeah, how do I look?
   Marge: Do we have enough glasses?
   Homer: Do we have enough gag ice cubes?
   Marge: Homer, Homer, put a record on.
   Homer: What are all our friends' names again?
   -- pre-party panic, ``''
   
 Ned, Maude, and Moe are the first guests.
   
   And the house!  You've done...
   [looks at the living room; nothing spectacular]  Whatever!
   -- Ned tries to compliment the Simpsons, ``''
   
 Ned mixes a drink...
   
   Homer: Hey, Flanders, next time why don't you put a little alcohol in it!
   Ned:   Au contraire, Simpson.  It has three shots of rum, a jigger of
          bourbon, and just a little daberilla of creme de cassis for flavor.
   Homer: Really?  Well, I do have a warm sense of well-being, and I sheem
          to be slurring my speech.  You're right!  Gimme another.
   -- Flanders demonstrates his mixological skills, ``''
   
   Marge: Homer, go easy on the alkyhol.  Remember last year at the Winfields'
          party when you threw up in the laundry hamper?
   Homer: No.
   Marge: Mm.
   -- Homer starts getting tipsy, ``''
   
 The party is in full swing, sort of...
   
   Hey!  You're Homer's sister-in-law, right?
   I remember you.  But I don't remember you being so beau[burp]tiful.
   [she maces him]  Oh, ow, hey, [burp] [cough]
   Is that a new kind of mace?  It's really painful.
   -- Barney talks to Patty (or is it Selma?), ``''
   
 Dr. Hibert is not amused by Homer's gag ice cube.  Bart swipes some
 `horse doovers'', and Homer asks him to do ``that thing you know how
 to do'' for the adults.  Bart doesn't know what he's talking about,
 so Homer sends him to bed.  Later that evening, Homer makes a fool of
 himself with a lampshade on his head.  Meanwhile, Maggie gets into
 the pile of coats and makes confetti of the dollar bills.  Homer drunkenly
 tells off a guest, and looks down Maude's dress.  The guests leave...
   
   Dr. Hibert:  If you want him to live through the night, I suggest you
       roll him onto his stomach.
   Marge: Thank you, I will, Dr. Hibert.  Thanks for coming.
   Dr. Hibert:  Remember, I said `if'.
   -- The party's over, ``''
       [And notice that she didn't roll him over! -- Chuck Anderson]
   
 The next morning, Marge vacuums around Homer, and drags him into the car.
   
   Bart: They're fighting in the car again.
   Lisa: That music always sends a chill down my spine.
   -- The kids watch Marge and Homer talk in the car, ``''
   
 Marge asks Homer if he remembers how he acted at the party, and Homer's
 recollection is most flattering to himself, then his memory kicks in,
 and he realizes what really happened.
   
   I like to think that I am a patient, tolerant woman, and that there
   was no line you could cross that would make me stop loving you.
   But last night, you didn't just cross that line, you threw up on it!
   -- Marge, ``''
   
 Marge says she's going to church alone.
   
   Marge: You are going to stay here and explain to Bart why you scarred
          him for life.
   Homer: No, I didn't!  I ... Oh, you mean inside, don't you.
   -- ``''
   
 Homer talks to Bart.
   
   Homer: About last night.  You might have noticed Daddy acting a little
          strange and you probably don't understand why.
   Bart:  I understand why.  You were wasted.
   -- Damage control, ``''
   
   Homer: I'm sorry it happened, and I just hope you didn't lose a lot of respect
          for me.
   Bart:  Dad, I have as much respect for you as I ever did or ever will.
   Homer: Awww.... [pats Bart's head]
   -- Damage control, ``''
   
 In church...
   
   We have some new pamphlets available in our church newsrack, including
   `Bible Bafflers', `Satan's Boners', `Good Grief: More Satan's Boners'
   and for the teens, `It's Not Cool to Fry in Hell'.
   -- Rev. Lovejoy, ``''
   
 Homer tries to sneak into church, but his squeaky shoes give him away.
 Rev. Lovejoy invites all interested parties to his marriage retreat.
 Marge signs up for it, despite Homer's attempts to stop her.

 [End of Act One.  Time: 7:00]

 Homer learns the retreat is at Catfish Lake and plans to get some fishing
 done, but Marge tells him there will be no fishing.  The babysitter arrives
 but recognizes Bart and screams in terror when she remembers how baby Bart
 managed to start the car and drive it across the lawn.
   
   Marge:  Grampa, could you do something?
   Grampa: I can dress myself.
   -- Asking Grampa to babysit the kids, ``''
   
 Grampa agrees to babysit the kids, and Homer secrets a tackle box in
 the car trunk.  Marge leaves the kids in Grampa's care.  She hands
 Grampa the list of emergency numbers, then goes to the kids and
 hugs Bart (``Nga!''), Lisa (``Mmm...'') and Maggie (``suck, suck, suck'')
 farewell.  She pulls a slip of paper out of her hair.  ``Call this number
 if Grampa falls in the bathtub''.  (``I heard that!'')
   
   Bart:   Grampa, Mom was in such a hurry, she forgot to give you this.
           It's a list of the things Lisa and I can and can't do.
   Grampa: [reads] Eh heh.  Uh huh.  You're allowed to smoke cigars?
   -- Marge leaves the kids in Grampa's care, ``''
   
 On the drive to Catfish Lake, Homer stops at a gas station/bait store
 and learns about `General Sherman', the huge catfish that lives in the
 lake.  Homer announces that he will catch the General.  Meanwhile,
 Grampa drives the kids to the supermarket...
   
   Bart: After the supermarket, we'll go to the video store, grab a Krusty
         Burger, and head for the arcade.
   Lisa: Bart, Grampa's a kindly old man.  He trusts us.  Are you sure it's
         right to take advantage of him?
   Bart: Lis, in these crazy topsy-turvy times, who's to say what's right or
         wrong?  But right now, my gut's telling me, ``Bleed Gramps dry.''
   -- Grampa babysits the kids, ``''
   
 The Simpsons arrive at the retreat and find the Flanderses also in
 attendance.
   
   A marriage can't be reconciled in a few hours, Homer.
   It takes a whole weekend to do that!
   -- Rev. Lovejoy's marriage encounter retreat, ``''
   
   Rev.:  We must bait our hooks with honesty.  That way, a happy marriage,
          heh heh, won't be the one that got away.
   Homer: I see. [sotto voce] He also understands bowling expressions.
   -- Rev. Lovejoy welcomes Homer to his marriage encounter retreat,
      ``''
   
   Ah, three couples.  Our best turnout yet!
   -- Rev. Lovejoy opens the marriage counseling retreat, ``''
   
 He asks the first couple, John and Gloria, to describe their problems,
 and tells them to look into each others' eyes.  They forgive each other
 and leave to rekindle their relationship.  Next is Ned's turn.
   
   Ned:   Sometimes Maude (God bless her), she underlines passages in &lt;my&gt; Bible
          because she can't find hers.
   Homer: [mutters] Oh.  Lucky they don't keep guns in the house.
   -- At Rev. Lovejoy's marriage encounter retreat, ``''
   
 Now it's Homer's turn to list Marge's faults...
   
   Rev.:  Marge is going to tell us about your faults, why don't you tell
          us about hers?
   Homer: Oh, she's perfect.
   Rev.:  Come on, Homer, what are her faults?
   Homer: Well, sometimes it can be annoying.
   -- At Rev. Lovejoy's marriage encounter retreat, ``''
   
 Then it's Marge's turn...
   
   Marge: He chews with his mouth open, he gambles, he hangs out at a seedy
          bar with bums and lowlifes.
   Homer: [covers his face] Oh, it's all true!
   Rev.:  Homer, don't interrupt.
   Homer: Sorry.

 Meanwhile, the kids go grocery shopping.
   
   Lisa: Half a gallon of chocolate.
   Bart: Check.
   Lisa: Half a gallon of chocolate brownie fudge.
   Bart: Check.
   Lisa: Half a gallon of chocolate chocolate chocolate chocolate chip.
   Bart: Yep.
   Grampa: Did your mom really write that shopping list?
   Lisa: Grampa, what a question!
   -- Shopping for groceries, ``''
   
 By 9:30pm, Marge has finished her list of Homer's faults.
 The kids watch a McBane movie, then are sent to bed.
   
   It's no use kidding myself.  I'm having an ethical crisis.
   -- Lisa is concerned about how she and Bart are taking advantage of Grampa,
      ``''
   
 Homer wakes up at 5am and plans `the perfect crime' to sneak out, catch
 General Sherman, and return before Marge wakes up.  He gets out of bed,
 already in his fishing clothes, but Marge wakes up.  She scolds him for
 thinking about fishing when their marriage is at stake and tells him
 to come back to bed.  Homer asks if he can take a walk, and Marge agrees.
 Outside, Homer sees a fisherman walking away from the pier.  He grabs
 the fishing rod and says, ``Hey kid, you forgot your...  Whoaaaa!'' as
 the fishing line is pulled away by General Sherman.

 [End of Act Two.  Time: 14:49]

 Homer has landed in a boat and is waiting for General Sherman to tire
 so he can reel him in.  Marge hears Homer's screams.  Back home...

   Lisa:   Yes, ten please.
   Bart:   [shaking]  Hey Grampa, top me off.
   Grampa: Are you sure your Ma let you kids drink coffee?
   Bart:   [snaps] For the last time, yes!

 Homer continues to struggle with the fish, and Bart invites everyone to
 `Casa de Simpson' for a party.  ``The only adult is frail and old.''
 At the retreat...
   
   Helen: Now, this is a trust exercise.
          You fall backwards and rely on your spouse to catch you.
   Marge: Do I have to do this?
   Rev.:  No.  Even if your husband &lt;were&gt; here, I wouldn't recommend it.
   -- Marriage counseling retreat, ``''
   
   Marge, as a trained marriage counselor, this is the first instance where
   I've ever told one partner that they were 100% right.  It's all his fault.
   I'm willing to put that on a certificate you can frame.
   -- Rev. Lovejoy, ``''
   
 Grampa emerges from the shower to find Bart's party well under way.
 On the lake...

   Bart: Not yet, but the afternoon is young.

   Bart: Lisa, what's wrong?
   Lisa: Isn't it obvious?  We've degraded ourselves and set back the children's

   Bart: You're great at a party, Lis.  Really great.
   -- Lisa observes the wild party Bart is throwing, ``''
   
 Grampa tries to control the situation, with absolutely no success.
 Homer finally subdues General Sherman.  Bart wishes the partygoers
 farewell, and Grampa cries on the couch.
   
   Bart: Lisa, I have this strong unpleasant feeling I've never had before.
   Lisa: It's called remorse, you vile burlesque of irrepresible youth.
   -- Is it contagious? ``''
   
 To make it go away, ``You grab a bucket and a brush and you clean harder
 and faster than you've ever cleaned before.''  Homer celebrates victory,
 to find Marge waiting on the pier for him.  Marge says the fish represents
 how selfish he is, so Homer angrily tosses General Sherman back into the
 lake.
   
   I gave up fame and breakfast for our marriage.
   -- Homer, after tossing `General Sherman' back into the lake,

 The two are reconciled.  Bart and Lisa furiously clean up the house
 just in time for Homer and Marge's return.  Grampa explains that his
 secret is pretending to cry, and gloats, ``I can turn it on like
 a faucet.''
   
   I'll never trust another old person...

 At the bait shop...

          bottom-dwelling fury, don't you know.  No one knows how old he is, but
          if you ask me (and most people do), he's hundred years if he's a day.
   Customer: And uh no one's ever caught him?
   Clerk: Well, one fella came close.  Went by the name of Homer.  Seven feet
          tall he was, with arms like tree trunks.  His eyes were like steel,
          cold, hard. Had a shock of hair, red like the fires of Hell.

 EPISODE TITLE: Three Men and a Comic Book


EPISODE SUMMARY: 

 Marge chauffeurs Lisa and Bart en route to the Springfield Comics
 convention...
   
   Lisa:  If we don't get to the convention soon, all the good comics will
          be gone!
   Bart:  Ah, what do you care about good comics?  All you every buy is Casper
          the Wimpy Ghost.
   Lisa:  I think it's sad that you equate friendliness with wimpiness, and
          I hope it'll keep you from ever achieving true popularity.
   Bart:  Well, you know what I think?  I think Casper is the ghost of
          Richie Rich. [shows comics of Casper and Richie Rich]
   Lisa:  Hey, they do look alike!
   Bart:  Wonder how Richie died.
   Lisa:  Perhaps he realized how hollow the pursuit of money really is and
          took his own life.
   Marge: Kids, could you lighten up a little?
   -- driving to the comics convention, ``Three Men and Comic Book''
   
 At the convention, Bart and Lisa stand in line for tickets, and discover
 that visitors who come dressed as comic-book stars are entitled to a
 discount.
   
   Too bad you didn't come dressed as a popular cartoon character.
   -- Lisa to Bart at the comics convention, ``''
      [a little meta-humor for your enjoyment]
   
 So Bart ducks into a phone booth and emerges as BartMan.  But it doesn't
 get him a discount.  Diamond Joe Quimby delivers the opening address for the
 convention.  Martin goes to the lost-and-found table in search of a left
 Vulcan ear.  At a table where prospective artists have the opportunity
 to show their work to an industry professional, Bart happens upon Otto.
   
   Bart: Oooh, what's that?
   Otto: My very own idea for a comic book, little man.
         [unveils his conception of Busman, which bears a distinct resemblance
         to Otto despite some anatomically awesome features]
         It's about a dude who drives a school bus by day, but by night,
         fights vampires in a post-apocalyptic war zone!
   Bart: Cool!
   -- A Heroic Ideal, ``''
   
 Bart attends a film exhibition of one of the early Radioactive Man
 episodes.
   
   Radioactive Man: Ah, these Laramie cigarettes give me the steady nerves that
       I need to combat evil.
   Fallout Boy: Gee willikers, Radioactive Man.  Wished I was old enough to
       smoke Laramies.
   Radioactive Man: Sorry, Fallout Boy, not until you're sixteen.
   -- ``''
   
 The convention's celebrity guest is none other than Buddy `Fallout Boy'
 Hodges himself, who fields questions from the inquisitive youngsters.
   
   Do you think the ghost of Dirk Richter haunts the bordello where his
   bullet-riddled body was found?
   -- Bart asks a pointed question at a Q&amp;A session at the comic convention,
      ``''
   
 After the seminar, Bart checks out a dealer's display table.  The dealer
 shows Bart his most prized possession...
   
   Bart:   Wow, Radioactive Man #1!  I bet it's worth a million bucks!
   Dealer: It is, my lad.  But I'll let you have it for a hundred, because you
           remind me of me.
   -- A deal that's hard to beat, ``''
   
   Until this moment, I never knew why God put me on this earth, but now I know:
   To buy that comic book!
   -- Bart, ``''
   
 but Bart has only $30.  The convention ends, and the Shriners arrive to
 use the center.  Homer and Marge pick up the kids, who are pleased that
 Homer is taking them to Krusty Burger for dinner.  Then Bart asks...
   
   Bart:  I need a hundred dollars for a comic book.
   Homer: A hundred bucks for a comic book?  Who drew it, Michael Milangelo?
   -- ``''
   
   Bart:  I want this more than anything in the world.
   Homer: Well, T.S.!

   Bart:  Please, Dad.
   Homer: No!  Now look, son, we all know that usually when you bug me like
          this, I give in, so I'm not mad at you for trying.  (It shows
          you've been paying attention.)  But we all know I'm not gonna give
          you a hundred dollars.  Now, are you going to stop bugging me?
   Bart:  No.

 Marge tells Bart a story of how she earned money to buy a light bulb toy
 oven.

 and concludes...
   
   Marge: Maybe a part-time job is the answer.
   Bart:  Oh, Mom, I couldn't ask you to do that.  Your already taking care
          of Maggie and Lisa is such a handful.
   Lisa:  She means &lt;you&gt; should get a job, stupid!

   Bart:  [Daniel Stern's voice, a la Wonder Years]  Me?  Get a job?  Were they
          serious?  I didn't realize it at the time, but a little piece of my
          childhood had slipped away, forever.
   Homer: Bart!  What are you staring at?
   Bart:  Uh, nothing.  [Daniel Stern continues]  He didn't say it, and neither
          did I, but at that moment, my dad and I were closer than we...

   Bart:  All those coins were only worth three lousy cents?

 Bart empties a half-full coke bottle, and takes it to his local Kwik-E-Mart.
   
   Bart: There you go, Apu.
   Apu:  Ah, very good.  Would you like the deposit defrayed from the cost of a
         jumbo cherry squishy?
   Bart: No, not today, I need the dime.
   Apu:  Oh, it is good to see you are learning a trade.
   -- Young entrepeneurship, ``''
   
 Bart sets up an outdoor beverage stand, but soon concludes that ``lemonade
 sucks''.  He manages to attract a significantly larger clientele when he
 switches to beer as his product of choice.
   
   Barney: Hey, Bart, can you give me one on credit?  I'm a little short this
           week.
   Bart:   Beat it.

 ... but Bart manages to buy off the cops with some free brew.  Homer
 arrives home and wails tearfully at the loss of his beer.  At Jake's
 Unisex Hair Palace, Marge talks about Bart's dilemma, and Mrs. Quick
 offers to pay Bart to do chores at her house.  Bart goes to Mrs. Quick's
 house, where he gets an enthusiastic reception.
   
   Dried apricots?  Almond paste?  Sauerkraut candy!
   -- Mrs. Quick offers Bart some sweets, ``''
   
 Bart enquires about a soldier photo sitting on a desk, and Mrs. Quick
 recounts the tale of her brother Asa who died in WW II after holding a
 grenade too long.

   This one's for you, Kaiser Bill.  Special delivery from Uncle Sam and all the

 Mrs. Quick sends Bart out to clear weeds from her jungle-like backyard, and
 sits down to enjoy a smarmy soap.

   Mrs.Q: Filthy!  But genuinely arousing.
   -- Mrs. Quick watches a smarmy soap, ``''
   
 Bart comes in, scraped up by his arduous labor.  Mrs. Quick applies iodine
 directly to his cuts, with predictably painful results.  At home, Bart
 complains to Marge.  The next day, he gets to clean sludge from Mrs. Quick's
 drainage pipe.  Afterward, Mrs. Quick shows Bart her remarkably versatile
 wedding/funeral dress.  Bart goes to the comic shop, where he gazes at
 Radioactive Man #1 through the store window.
   
   Last night, I dreamed I held you in my arms.
   -- Bart, Romancing the Comic, ``''
   
 Later, Bart is scratched by Mrs. Quick's cat while scrubbing the floor.  But
 Mrs. Quick tends to Bart's injury with Tender Loving Care and a bottle of
 iodine.
   
   No, no, not the iodine.  Burn the germs off with a torch.

 At the end of the week, Bart receives the sum total of fifty cents.
   
   Mrs. Quick:  Bart!  You didn't say `Thank you'.
   Bart:        Listen Lady, I can leave without screaming, and I can
                leave without saying a bad word, but there is no way that I
                am saying `Thank you'.
   Mrs. Quick:  You're welcome!
   -- Bart is upset that he worked his tail off and got paid only fifty cents,

 Bart comes home and mutters angrily.
   
   Homer: Hey, when I was your age, fifty cents was a lot of money.
   Bart:  Really?
   Homer: Naah.

   Bart:  I am through with working.  Working is for chumps.

 Bart returns to the shop, and walks in on Martin trying to bargain for
 Radioactive Man #1.
   
   Martin: Can you let me have it for forty dollars?
   Dealer: Forty bucks?  You made me get off my stool for that?
   Martin: It's all I got.  I sold seeds.  I visited my aunt in the nursing home.
           I fished a dime out of the sewer, for God's sake!

   Bart:   Can I have it for thirty-five?

 Milhouse enters in search of a baseball card, but Bart realizes that the
 three of them together have enough money to buy the comic.  Martin and
 Milhouse consent to the joint purchase.
   
   Bart:   Look pal, we got a hundred bucks and we'd like to buy
           Radioactive Man #1.  So why don't you just waddle over
           there and get it?
   Dealer: Yes, sir.
   -- Bart in charge, ``''
   
 Outside the shop, the boys discover that each of them had intended to take
 comic home.  A storm broods over the skies of Springfield, evilly portending
 the conflict that will soon arise between these three friends.

 [End of Act Two.  Time: 14:28]

 In Bart's treehouse, Martin, Milhouse, and Bart carefully read their comic
 and discover the secret origin of Radioactive Man.
   
   Martin: I would've thought that being hit by an atomic bomb would've
           killed him.
   Bart:   Now you know better.
   -- The gang read the original `Radioactive Man' comic,
      ``''
   
 The boys negotiate the terms of their joint ownership.
   
   Martin:   How about this, guys?  Bart can have it Mondays and Thursdays,
             Milhouse will get it Tuesdays and Fridays, and yours truly will
             take it Wednesdays and Saturdays.
   Bart:     Perfect!
   Milhouse: Wait a minute!  What about Sundays?
   Bart:     [suspiciously] Yeah, what &lt;about&gt; Sundays?
   Martin:   Well, Sunday possession will be determined by a random number
             generator.  I will take the digits 1 through 3, Milhouse will
             have 4 through 6, and Bart will have 7 through 9.
   Bart:     Perfect!
   Milhouse: Wait a minute!  What about 0?
   Bart:     [suspiciously] Yeah, what &lt;about&gt; 0?
   Milhouse: Yeah.
   Martin:   Well, in the unlikely event of a 0, possession will be determined
             by Rock Scissors Paper competition, best 3 out of 5.  How's that?
   Bart and: Oh, okay.
   Milhouse: Yeah, all right.
   -- An Equitable Split, ``''
   
 But as the night progresses, tensions rise and suspicions breed.
 A fight breaks out, but it is cut short when Marges comes by to visit.
 Each suspecting the other two, all three spend the night in the treehouse
 with the comic book.  Later on in the evening, Martin gets up to go to
 the bathroom, but Bart and Milhouse think he is attempting to steal the
 comic.  They bind him up in a chair.  When Bart's paranoia increases to
 dangerous levels, Milhouse threatens to tell Marge.
   
   Bart:   Hey, Martin, tell him what we do with squealers.
   Martin: I don't know.  Is it worse than what you do with people who have to go
           to the bathroom?
   -- Crime and Punishment, ``''
   
 Bart and Milhouse fight fiercely as the storm rages outside.  Marge asks
 Homer to check on the kids, but Homer doesn't do a very good job of it.
 Milhouse tumbles out of the treehouse.  Bart catches him by the sleeve,
 which slowly begins to tear.  Meanwhile, the wind blows the comic book
 against the doorway, and it is on the verge of falling into the rain
 outside.  Faced with the decision of saving Milhouse or the comic, Bart
 reluctantly chooses Milhouse.  During the brief moment in which Bart
 comforts the frightened Milhouse, the comic falls outside onto the
 rain-drenched ground.  Then Santa's Little Helper eats it.  Then lightning
 incinerates it.  Marge summons the boys inside because the weather is so bad.
   
   I've got some cocoa on the stove.  Who wants imitation marshmallows?
   -- Marge, ``''
   
 The next morning, Homer finds the car filled with water because he left
 the windows open.  In a beautiful little 3-D animation sequence, the boys
 ponder over the lessons of the previous evening.
   
   Bart:     We worked so hard, and now it's all gone.
             We ended up with nothing because the three of us can't share.
   Milhouse: What's your point?
   Bart:     Nothing.  Just kind of ticks me off.
   -- The moral of the story, ``''
   
 Well, the world is safe again...  But...  for how long?

 After the 30-Apr-1992 airing, a brief Simpsons clip was shown.

 Close-up of the Simpsons television.  A picture of Bill Cosby, with
 the legend, ``The Cosby Show / 1984-1992''.  Muses Homer, ``Little
 Theo.  You grew up before our eyes.''  Bart asks, ``Hey, Dad.  How
 come they're taking The Cosby Show off the air?''  Homer answers,
 ``Because Mr. Cosby wanted to stop before the quality suffered.''
   
   Quality, schmality!  If I had a TV show, I'd run that sucker into the ground!

 his blood, but Marge tells him it's the right thing to do.  And Homer tells
 Bart he'll be showered with gifts if he does...
   
   Homer: Don't you know the story of Hercules and the lion?
   Bart:  Is it a Bible story?
   Homer: Yeah, probably.  Anyway, once upon a time, there was a big mean lion

          out, but nobody was strong enough!  So, they got Hercules.  And
          Hercules used his mighty strength, and Bingo!  Anyway, the moral is,
          the lion was so happy, he gave Hercules this big... thing... of riches.

          you're living in a world of make-believe!  With flowers and bells

 Homer is about to mail the letter, but Marge convinces him to sleep on it.
 Homer's dream defies description.  The next morning, Homer thanks Marge
 for stopping him.  We see Bart walking down to the corner mailbox and
 putting the letter in.

 [End of Act 1.  Time: 9:35]

 Homer turns the house upside-down to find the letter, then learns Bart
 mailed the letter.  Homer attacks Bart, but Marge scolds him.  ``You
 should be strangling yourself.''  Homer and Bart try to retrieve the
 letter from the mailbox, with no success.

 Burns tells Smithers to have Homer beaten to a pulp.  Back at home,
 Homer bemoans his fate.
   
   Bart: You always told me I was going to destroy the family.  But I never
         believed it.
   Lisa: That's okay, Bart.  Nobody really believed it.

   No, it's not a misprint, for you see, I enjoyed writing this book as much
   as you enjoyed reading it.  The End.
   -- Burns finishes his book, ``''
   
 Smithers comes in and says he didn't order the beating, since after all,
 Homer saved his life.  Burns is won over.  At Moe's Tavern, Homer
 drowns his sorrows in drink.

   Bart: Uh, hello.  Is Mike there?  Last name, Rotch.
   Moe:  Hold on, I'll check. [calls]  Mike Rotch!  Mike Rotch!  Hey, has

 After much searching, he finds it, for $32,000.  A huge crate is delivered to

          Just a big scary rock.
   Bart:  Hey, man, don't bad-mouth the head.
   Marge: Homer, it's the thought that counts.  The moral of the story is a
          good deed is its own reward.
   Bart:  Hey, we &lt;got&gt; a reward.  The head is cool.
   Marge: Then... I guess the moral is no good deed goes unrewarded.
   Homer: Wait a minute.  If I hadn't written that nasty letter, we wouldn't've
          gotten anything.
   Marge: Well... Then I guess the moral is the squeaky wheel gets the grease.
   Lisa:  Perhaps there is no moral to this story.
   Homer: Exactly!  Just a bunch of stuff that happened.
   Marge: But it certainly was a memorable few days.
   Homer: Amen to that!

 EPISODE TITLE: Stark Raving Dad


EPISODE SUMMARY: 

   
 Before the 30-Jan-1992 airing, a brief Simpsons clip was shown.
 [Written with help from Gregory Abel (gabel@vtssi.vt.EDU).]

 Fade in from black.  The Simpsons living room.  Homer and the
 Gruesome Twosome on the couch with TV dinner tables.  Maggie in
 her high chair stage right, sucking on her pacifier.  On the floor,
 Lisa and Bart are eating sundaes.  SLH is also on the floor.
 (Animation borrowed from [7[FG]02].)

 Zoom in on the TV set.  A live-action inset of President Bush
 giving a recent speech.  ``We need a nation closer to the Waltons
 than to the Simpsons.''

 Cut back to Homer and the Bouvier twins.  Homer's mouth drops open.
 ``Huh??''  The sisters light another cigarette.

 Homer's eye view of the kids in front of the set.  Bart turns and says...
   
   Bush:  We need a nation closer to the Waltons than to the Simpsons.
   Bart:  Hey, we're just like the Waltons.  We're praying for an end
          to the depression, too.
   -- Bart reacts to President Bush's recent (real) speech
   
 Fade to black.  End of clip.

 Lisa wakes up Bart by holding his nose shut until he gags awake.
   
   Lisa: [wakes up Bart]
   Bart: Lisa!  It's 6am!  Something's wrong.  Dad died!
   Lisa: No no, he's fine!
   Bart: Well, whaddya know, I'm relieved.
   -- ``''
   
   Lisa: Bart, my birthday's in two days.  I'm going to be eight years old.
         It's a big number, almost double digits.
   Bart: Well, enjoy it while you can.  Everything changes when you hit the
         big one-oh.  Your legs start to go, candy doesn't taste as good
         any more...
   Lisa: Bart, will you please let me pour my little heart out?
   Bart: Sorry, this old-timer does ramble on sometimes, don't he.
   -- Pre-life crisis?  ``''
   
 Lisa complains that Bart never does anything for her on her birthday,
 until he angrily gives in.  She hugs him and says, ``Oh, thank you.''
 At breakfast, Marge asks Bart to watch Maggie while she does the laundry.
 Bart sees the Krusty Hot-Line on his cereal box and calls it.
   
   Hi, kids!  You've reached the Krusty Hot-Line!
   If you haven't asked your parent's permission, naughty-naughty!
   But Krusty forgives you.
   ($2 for the first minute, 50 cents for each additional minute.)
   [laughs and laughs and laughs]
   Thanks for calling, kids!  A new message every day!
   -- 1-909-O-U-KLOWN, ``''
   
 Meanwhile, Maggie takes a ride on the ceiling fan.  Marge comes
 upstairs with the laundry and scolds Bart.
   
   Marge: Bart, I asked you to watch your sister [Maggie].
   Bart:  I tried to stop her, but she overpowered me!
   -- A likely story, ``''
   
 Maggie spits her pacifier at Bart.  Homer comes down to get a clean shirt,
 to find that they're all... pink?
   
   Aagh!  Pink?
   Marge, I can't wear a pink shirt to work.
   Everybody wears white shirts.  I'm not popular enough to be different...
   -- Homer finds all his shirts are pinko, ``''
   
 The reason is that Bart put his lucky red hat in with the wash.
 Marge assures Homer that nobody will notice.  At the office, Burns
 and Smithers review the tapes of the employees coming to work...
   
   Burns:    Why is that man in pink!
   Smithers: Oh, that's Homer Simpson, sir.
             He's one of your boobs from Sector 7-G.
   Burns:    Simpson, eh?
   -- ``''
   
   Burns:    Well, judging by his outlandish attire, he's some sort of
             free-thinking anarchist.
   Smithers: I'll call security, sir.
   Burns:    Excellent.  Yes, these color monitors have already
             paid for themselves...
   -- Homer wears a pink shirt to work, ``''
   
 Homer's coworkers razz him about wearing pink, and
 he is carted off by security to an interrogation room.  He tries to explain
 what happened, but Burns doesn't believe him.  Smithers notes that the
 body cavity search turned up nothing, nor did X-rays.  Burns recalls
 Smithers' penchant for bell-bottom trousers, but that was for the company
 performance of HMS Pinafore.  (``Oh, yes.  Your spirited hornpipes stole
 the show, as I recall.'')  Burns asks Dr. Marvin Monroe for assistance.
   
   Burns:  Doctor, what should we do about our freewheeling fop over here?
   Monroe: Well, Monty, it used to be that establishing a patient's sanity
           took months.  That's all changed, thanks to the Marvin Monroe
           take-home personality test.  Twenty simple questions that will
           determine exactly how crazy or [makes quotation sign with fingers]
           `meshuggeneh' someone is.  [hands it to Homer]
   Homer:  [reading]  Print name?   [moans]  Oh...
   -- In triplicate, please... ``''
   
 At home, Marge applies hair spray, three empty cans atop her dresser.
 She finds her can empty and opens her drawer, revealing a dozen cans ready
 to go.  She grabs one and continues spraying...

 Homer comes home and asks her to fill out the personality test, but she
 insists it's something only he can do.  He goes to Lisa's room...
   
   Homer: Lisa, you like homework.  Could you fill out this form for me?
   Lisa:  Well, all right.  If you'll listen to the poem I just wrote.
   Homer: D'oh!!  Oh, okay.
   Lisa:  Meditations on Turning Eight, by Lisa Simpson.
          [reads]
          I had a cat named Snowball --
          She died!  She died!
          Mom said she was sleeping --
          She lied!  She lied!
          Why oh why is my cat dead?
          Couldn't that Chrysler hit me instead?
          [next verse]
          I had a hamster named Snuffy --
          He died...
   Homer: [takes his form]  No deal.
   -- Death and Transfiguration, ``''
   
 Homer goes to Bart...
   
   Bart:  Dad, maybe you should do this.
   Homer: Son, it's no different than the time I let you vote for me.

   Announcer: And finally, Baby With a Nail Gun. [kachunk]
   Homer: Aww....
   Announcer: Okay, it's time to cast your votes now!
   Homer: Dog On Fire!  Dog On Fire!
   -- America's Stupidest Home Videos, ``''
   
   Bart:  Hey, Dad, do you hear voices?
   Homer: [angrily] Yes, I'm hearing one right now while I'm trying to watch TV...
   Bart:  [checks] Yes.  Are you quick to anger?
   Homer: Bart!  Shut up or I'll shut you up!
   Bart:  [checks] Yes.  Do you wet your pants?  Well, even the best of us
          has an occasional accident.

   Doctor: Right.  [shows another]
   Homer:  Uh, that's a spill on the floor with bugs going after it.  Uh, they're
           going to eat it.
   Doctor: Good.  [shows another, which looks like Bart]
   Homer:  THE BOY!!!!!!  [restrained by two orderlies]
   -- I'm perfectly normal, really... ``''
   
   Homer:  This isn't fair!  How can you tell who's sane and who's insane?

   Homer: Okay.  Five times nine.
   Floyd: Forty-five.
   Homer: Wow!

 He also introduces the taciturn Chief, who says, `Hello.'  The doctors
 and nurses rush over excitedly.  ``Well, it's about time somebody reached
 out to me.''  Homer is too embarrassed to phone home, so The Man offers to
 do it.
   
   Homer: I gotta call my family.  Oh, this is so embarrassing, calling them
          from a nuthouse.  I mean, they think I'm a god!
   Man:   I could call them for you.

   Man:  Could be.  It's a big hospital.

 Bart gives him a little interrogation, which the man passes.

 That evening, Homer is scared, so The Man sings him a song.
 Homer has dozed off, but is talking in his sleep...
   
   Homer: [talking in his sleep] pancakes... football... boobies...

 [End of Act Two.  Time: 11:01]

 The next morning, Homer joins a discussion group.  The nurse tells them
 to relax.  Behind a one-way mirror, doctors monitor the discussion with
 a mind-boggling array of advanced electronics equipment and readouts.
   
   Dave:  So I was working in an insurance company, right?  Youngest VP
          in the history of the firm, okay?  The job was my life.
          Then one Monday morning, I got up.  I got up, I couldn't leave
          the house.  I just couldn't.
   Homer: Was the door locked?
   Dave:  No, I just couldn't face what was out there.
   Homer: Was it raining?
   Nurse: No, Homer, Dave suffers from agoraphobia, a fear of open areas and
          crowds.  Please, Dave, go on.
   Dave:  Thank you.  Anyway, that day I just knew I just couldn't make that
          long drive to work.
   Homer: Were you out of gas?
   Nurse: [glares at Homer]
   Homer: Pffft.  Baby...

 Marge talks to a doctor.
   
   Doctor: Mrs. Simpson, I'm sorry, but your husband suffers from a persecution
           complex, extreme paranoia, and bladder hostility.
   Marge:  Doctor, if you just talk to him for five minutes without mentioning
           our son Bart, you'd see how sane he is.
   Doctor: You mean there really is a Bart?!  Good Lord!

 Homer's breakfast of pancakes is interrupted by Marge, and he is released.
   
   Doctor: Mr. Simpson, after talking to your wife, we believe you're no
           threat to yourself or others.
   Homer:  That's the most flattering thing anyone has ever said to me.
           Can I have it in writing, please?
   Doctor: Of course.  [hands Homer a certificate:

 Homer is grateful to The Man ...
   
   Homer: If you ever find your marbles, come visit us.
   Man:   Well, how about today?  I'm only here voluntarily.
   Homer: You are!?  Why?
   Man:   Well, back in 1979, I got real depressed when my `Off the Wall'
          album just got one lousy Grammy nomination.

 At home, Lisa and Maggie sit at the kitchen table, and Lisa sings sadly
 to herself... ``Happy birthday to me, Happy birthday to me, Happy birthday

 Homer starts to threaten Bart, then realizes that the doctors are watching.
   
   Homer: [on the phone with Bart]
          I'm bringing Michael Jackson home to stay with us for a few days.
          [aside]  Isn't that cute, he's heard of you.
          [to phone]  Now make sure we have plenty of cold cuts, and put some
          beer on ice...

   Milhouse:  No.

 Word quickly spreads throughout town.  Apu hears the report on the radio
 and debates with himself whether he should leave his post.  He does so,
 turning the `We never close' sign over to read `Closed for the first time
 ever'.  The Simpsons front lawn is swarming with people (and even a
 helicopter), as Mayor Diamond Joe Quimby orates...

   since the Dalai Lama visited in 1952.  And so, I hereby declare that

 When Homer and The Man arrive, everybody is disappointed that it's not
 the real Michael Jackson and quickly wander off.
   
   Lisa: Bart, the entire town is howling for your blood, and before I join
         them, I have one question.  Today is my birthday.  You promised
         to get me something and... and... I'm afraid to ask...
   Bart: You know, maybe you should trust that instinct and not ask.

 Homer tries (and fails) to wash the `INSANE' stamp off his hand.
 Lisa angrily writes Bart a letter...
   
   Dear Bart, I am using the stationery Mom and Dad gave me &lt;for my birthday&gt;
   to inform you that we are now brother and sister in name only.  Perhaps
   if a professional so advises, I will give you a hug at some far-distant
   family reunion.  But rest assured, it will be purely for show. [sobs]
   -- Lisa writes a letter to Bart, ``''
   
 The Man sees Lisa and talks to Bart, and he suggests Bart write Lisa a
 song for her birthday.
   
   Bart: I can't write a song, I'm only ten.
   Man:  Only ten?  When I was your age, I had six gold records!

   Bart: Looney Toons, this is what Michael Jackson looks like.

 He tells Bart to believe what he wants.  Bart asks Michael to sit down at
 the piano while he boils some coffee.
   
   [to the tune of the Colonel Bogey March]
   Lisa, her teeth are big and green.
   Lisa, she smells like gasoline.
   Lisa, da da da Disa.

 The Man suggests they go look at Lisa so Bart can figure out what his
 feelings toward her are.  They do so from the treehouse.
   
   Man:  Oh, she looks sad.
   Bart: That's 'cause she knows you're looking at her.
   Lisa: [turns]  Although I'm aware you're looking at me, I would look
         exactly the same even if you weren't.
   -- ``''
   
 Back at the piano...
   
   Man:  Bart, think.  What happens to you when you turn eight?
   Bart: Well, your training wheels come off your bike...
   Man:  Good.  That's good.  [plays and sings]
         Your training wheels come off your bike,
         You start to notice boy you like.  Hee hee hee!
   Bart: You're just putting that in because it's commercial.
   Man:  [chuckles]

 The next morning, the newspaper headline reads, ``Michael Jackson a hoax!
 Everyone mad at local boy.''  Bart wakes up Lisa by holding her nose shut
 until she gags awake.  The Man wheels in the piano, and Bart takes an
 upended wastepaper basket for a drum, and they play and sing.  (Homer covers
 his head with his pillow.)  Lisa thanks them for the best birthday present
 she's ever gotten.
   
   Man:   [in his normal voice]  Well, my work is done here.
   Bart:  Hey, Michael, what happened to your voice?
   Man:   This is my real voice.  My name is Leon Kompowski, and I'm a bricklayer
          from Paterson, New Jersey.  All my life, I was very angry.  Until one
          day, I just [Michael Jackson voice] talked like this.
          [in his normal voice]  All of a sudden, everyone was smiling at me,
          and I was only doing good on this earth.  So I kept on doing it.

 Freeze Frame Fun


 The title sequence


J.D. Baldwin {jdb} reports:

In the title sequence, observe that in true cartoon style, the hole in the
wall is a silhouette of our favorite family.  Observe Bart's outstretched
hand, and that Marge's hair takes a chunk out of the picture, which swings
back and forth with the chunk missing.  What kind of hair spray &lt;does&gt; she
use?  We know she has a LOT of it.

Also, freeze-frame on the skinhead's bedroom (early on in the ``Michael
Jackson!?  Michael Jackson?!'' sequence).  In the background are, among
other nifty things:

   a)  a figurine of the devil on his dresser
   b)  a poster of the Grim Reaper holding a chainsaw labeled `DEATH'

 The Krusty Hotline is 1-909-O-U-KLOWN. {dh}

   But Bart dialed ``0530350''. {cjb}

    We both found what we are lookin' for.
    With a friend to call my own, I'll never be alone,
    And you, my friend, will see, you've got a friend in me.

 Lisa's birthday song


 As performed during the show, with piano and percussion:


[Michael]
Lisa, it's your birthday.  God bless you this day.
You gave me the gift of a little sister, and I'm proud of you today.

[Michael and Bart]
Lisa, it's your birthday.  Happy birthday, Lisa.
Lisa, it's your birthday.  Happy birthday, Lisa.

[Michael]
I wish you love and good will.  I wish you peace and joy.
[Bart]
I wish you better than your heart desires.
[Michael]                                   And your first kiss from a boy.

[Michael and Bart]
Lisa, it's your birthday.  Happy birthday, Lisa.
Lisa, it's your birthday.  Happy birthday, Lisa.

[Bart]  Yeah!

 As performed over the credits, with full musical back-up:

[Michael and Bart]         Happy birthday, Lisa.

[Michael] Hoo!

 Animation and continuity goofs


David Hall observes that Maggie spits her pacifier at Bart, yet when Marge
sat her down in the high-chair, she still has it in her mouth.  [That's
because Maggie has a near-infinite supply of pacifiers.  See `The Pacifier'
on the Tracey Ullman Show. --rjc]

 Who is John Jay Smith?


When Matt Groening appeared on The Tonight Show, Jay Leno (who is a
Simpsons fan) asked him if it really was Michael Jackson.  Groening
answered that he is legally restrained from confirming it.  But he
hinted very strongly that it indeed was the Gloved One.

Paul Jeong (pjeong@oahu.cs.ucla.edu) reports from an appearance at
UCLA of Matt Groening, Nancy Cartwright, and other members of the
staff.  (David Silverman is a UCLA alumnus.)

\C
    Someone asked if Michael Jackson really did the voice.  They were
    silent for a long while, and then they said they can't legally say
    whether it was Michael or not.  Then they went on about how they hate
    using fake names.  Then they said, read between the lines.  (Wink
    wink.)  And then they said how they never turned down a guest
    apperance...and one guy remarks, ``Hey, didn't Michael Jackson want to
    be on The Simpsons?''  Read between &lt;these&gt; lines...
\eC

What do you want us to do, hit you over the head?

 Assorted comments and observations


 The title

   The French translation uses the title ``My Friend Michael Jackson''.
        [Alberto Aimar (aimar@vxcrna.cern.ch)]

 The clip


The Bush quote came from a speech he gave on 27 January 1992 to a group
of religious broadcasters.  Apparently, he recycled the line in his
State of the Union Address on 28 January 1992.

 The John 3:16 man


Mark Yocom (n9043860@henson.cc.wwu.edu) explains...

The John 3:16 man is Rockin' Rollen Stewart, ``a born-again Christian whose
mission in life is to get his signs (and his mug) on national TV as often as
possible, the better to spread the word of the Lord.  Only in America.''
(according to `More of the Straight Dope', by Cecil Adams.)

The article goes on to explain that before he was born again, in 1980, his
main interest was being ``the most famous person in the world no one knows
about.''  For years he was the guy seen on telecasts of golf tournaments (of
all things -- Ed.) with the multicolored Afro wig.  This earned him the
nickname of `Rainbow Man'.

 Lisa's poem


The line `Couldn't that Chrysler hit me instead?' refers to the car
that ran over Snowball I.

Dennis Cleary (dfcleary@ucdavis.edu):

For someone just turning eight, this seems awfully advanced.  Not that the
poem is great or anything, but already feeling betrayed by your parents is
something that I wasn't able to put into words until I was the big 1-0,
when `your legs start to go, candy doesn't taste so good anymore,' etc.

I guess it was just another example of how Lisa feels betrayed by her
family.  I thought it went nicely with the scene of Lisa singing `Happy
Birthday' to herself.  I just wonder how the character development is
going to be carried through, when they insist on only making 20 shows a
year, showing us first and second season re-runs the rest of the time.

 The Environment


 Marge's hair spray


Jym Dyer suspects that there's probably a hole in the ozone layer right
above the Simpsons' house.  (FYI, Bart uses CFC-free spraypaint in the
`Bart Vs. The Space Mutants' video game.)

Jeff Meredith (mer@postgres.berkeley.edu) notes that Lisa would be thoroughly
disappointed in a mother that had such blatant disregard for Springfield's
ozone layer.

 Lisa's wastebasket


And Mark Walsh (beatlfan@leland.stanford.edu) noticed that ``when Bart dumped
Lisa's garbage can out onto the floor to use it as a drum, an aluminum can
fell out.  I'm disappointed.  I'm CERTAIN that Lisa would recycle.''  Members
of the Abject Admirers of Lisa Simpson the world over are profoundly
disappointed.

 Scott Fields (am949@cleveland.Freenet.Edu) listened to it many times and

is convinced that the person singing `Crazy' on the New Bedlam wrongly
committed hotline is Tracey Ullman.

 Amitava Biswas (ami@leland.stanford.edu) points out that Michael cannot

seem to teach Homer how to moonwalk, yet in Dancin Homer, Homer clearly
moonwalks on top of the dugout!

 The interrogation

 Nice, the powerplant has its own interrogation room... {cjb}

 Smithers notes, ``We must have X-rayed him a hundred times.''

    The equivalent of working in a nuclear power plant for five minutes.

 EPISODE TITLE: Mr. Lisa Goes to Washington


EPISODE SUMMARY: 

 Homer goes through the sweepstakes junk mail and discards most of it...
   
   Homer:  [receives a sweepstakes junk mail with a `You may have already won'
           check]  One million dollars!  I'm rich!  [rushes to the bank]
   Teller: Mr. Simpson, I can assure you, this check of yours is non-negotiable.
   Homer:  Oh yeah?  Well, what makes you so damn sure?
   Teller: See where it says, ``VOID VOID VOID'' and ``This is not a check'',
           ``Cash value one twentieth of a cent'', ``Mr. Banker, do not
           honor''...
   Homer:  Shut up.
   -- ``''
   
 At home, he gripes...
   
   Homer: I had a feeling it was too good to be true.
          Every time you get a million dollars, something queers the deal.
   Lisa:  I don't think real checks have exclamation points.
   -- Homer may have already won $1 million, ``''
   
   Marge: Well, at least we got a free sample of Reading Digest.
   Homer: Marge, I never read a magazine in my life, and I'm not going to start
          now.
   -- ``''
   
   Homer: [reading `Reading Digest']  Hey, a cartoon!
          [a woman tries to explain a pile of metal that used to be a car]
          ``Well, dear, you always wanted a compact...''
          [laughs]  Ain't it the truth!
   Marge: No, it's not the truth, Homer.  It's well-documented that women are
          safer drivers than men.
   Homer: Oh, Marge, cartoons don't have any deep meaning.  They're just
          stupid drawings that give you a cheap laugh.
          [gets up, revealing rear cleavage]
   -- ``''
   
 Homer reads `Reading Digest' at work...
   
   Len:   Hey Einstein, put down your reading.  It's lunchtime!
   Homer: Ah, you go ahead.
   Len:   Hey, you don't want to eat?  What did you do, get one of those
          stomach staples?
   Homer: As Tolstoi said in Quotable Notables, ``Give me learning, sir,
          and you may keep your black bread.''
   -- ``''
   
   Burns:    Who is that bookworm, Smithers?
   Smithers: Homer Simpson, sir.
   Burns:    Simpson, eh?  How very strange.

   -- Why is Homer reading on the job?  ``''
   
 He arrives home to see the kids glued to the television set...
   
   Announcer:  We now return to Troy McClure and Dolores Montenegro
               in ``Preacher with a Shovel''.
   Man's voice: But irrigation can &lt;save&gt; your people, Chief Smiling Bear!
   -- The wonders of the American cinema, ``''
   
 Homer gripes that the kids are wasting away their brains and should be
 reading...
   
   Marge: You've certainly taking a shine to that magazine.
   Homer: It's not just &lt;one&gt; magazine, Marge; they take &lt;hundreds&gt; of
          magazines, filter out the crap, and leave you with something
          that fits right in your front pocket.
          [struggles to shove it into his front pocket, tearing the seams
          in the process]
   -- Reading is fundamental, ``''
   
 He shuts off the television set and forces the kids to listen to him
 read to them.
   
   Homer: [reading]  Then I heard the sound that all Arctic explorers
          dread... the pitiless bark of the sea lion!
          [gasp]  He'll be killed!
   Marge: Homer, he obviously got out alive if he wrote the article.
   Homer: Don't be so... [flips ahead]  Oh, you're right.
   -- Book at bedtime, ``''
   
 A spectacled Homer reads in bed, and Marge suggests they snuggle.
   
   Homer: [reads]  Seven ways to spice up your marriage.
          [ahem] [reads woodenly]  Marge, you have a nice body.
          And if you'd like to see me in a costume, you have only to ask.
   Marge: Why, thank you, Homey.
   -- Book at bedtime, ``''
   
 The next day, Marge makes `meatloaf men', and Bart helps himself to
 a particularly hot one, biting off the head.  She got the idea from
 the magazine, of course.
   
   Homer: Wow, `Win a trip to Washington, DC.  All expenses paid, VIP tour'...
          Oh, it's for kids. [throws into trash]
   Lisa: Wait, Dad.  [fishes out of trash]
         Mm, an essay contest.  Children under twelve, three hundred words,
         fiercely pro-American.  Sounds interesting.
   -- ``''
   
 Marge suggests Bart enter, but he tells her that Lisa is ``the pony to bet
 on.''  In her room, Lisa studies `how a bill becomes law' and tries to
 write her essay...
   
   [as tranquil music plays in the background, Lisa writes her essay]
   What would Ben Franklin say if he were alive today?
   He'd say...  [tranquil music abruptly stops]
   [erasing]  Oh, think of a better opening.
   -- After all, Ben Franklin was an editor, ``''
   
 Marge suggests Lisa take a bike ride, and Lisa is somewhat annoyed that
 Marge isn't sure what's `cool' any more.  Lisa rides to Springfield
 National Forest (``Smoking really burns me up'') and is inspired by a bald
 eagle that perches in front of her.  Homer takes her to the regional
 competition at the Veterans of Popular Wars building...
   
   Lisa:  Thanks for driving me to the contest, Dad.
   Homer: Sweetheart, there's nothing I wouldn't do for that magazine.
   -- ``''
   
 Nelson concludes his patriotic/borderline-redneck essay.  Meanwhile,
 entrants from Minnesota, Alabama, and Queens compete in their regional
 contests.  When Lisa reads her essay, the judges nod knowingly to
 each other.  But one judge thinks it's a little &lt;too&gt; good, and
 decides to talk to Homer to see if he was the actual author.
   
   We the purple?  What the hell was that?
   -- Father to son on his essay topic, ``''
   
 After a brief interrogation, the judge is convinced that Homer had
 nothing to do with her essay.  (In fact, Lisa is awarded an extra
 five points.)  She wins the contest, and the family wins a trip to
 Washington, DC.
   
   Who would have guessed reading and writing would pay off!
   -- Homer, ``''
   
 [End of Act One: 6:52]

 On the plane, Homer calls the steward ...
   
   Steward: Yes, sir, can I get you something?
   Homer:   Playing cards, note pad, aspirin, sewing kit, pilot's wing pin,
            propeller-shaped swizzle stick, sleeping mask, and anything else
            I've got coming to me.
   Steward: I'll see what I can do.
   -- Flying to Washington, DC, ``''
   
 Meanwhile, Bart harrasses the businessman in the seat behind him working
 on his portable computer by repeatedly reclining his seat.
 The steward takes him into the cockpit...
   
   Pilot: And this control stick is like the handlebars on your tricycle.
          Now, would you like to see where we hang our coats?
   Bart:  No thank you.  I'd rather push this button.
          [leans over and pushes a button]
   Pilot: No!

   -- Homer, ``''
   
 They take a cab, passing by the IRS building (which Homer boos at),
 to the Watergate Hotel.  Bart pushes all the buttons on the elevator
 before leaving.  Marge is amazed by all the things that come with
 the hotel room.
   
   Wow!  A shoe horn!  Just like in the movies!
   -- Homer is amazed at what comes with the hotel room,
      ``''
   
 He has fun putting on and taking off his shoe, as Maggie watches.
 Meanwhile, Bart lets Lisa choose which bed she wants, but when she
 makes her choice, Bart acts pleased.  Lisa suspects that Bart did
 something to the bed, but he isn't telling.  Lisa yells, ``Mom!''
 At two in the morning, the phone rings, and Homer answers.  It's
 Bart pretending to be the hotel wake-up call.  He and Lisa get a good
 laugh out of this.

 The next day, the family meet Faith Crowley, patriotism editor of
 Reading Digest...
   
   Ooh, I love your magazine.  My favorite section is `How to increase
   your word power'.  That thing is really, really.. really.... good.
   -- Homer, ``''
   
 Faith introduces Lisa to the other finalists...
   
   Faith: Lisa, I'd like you to meet some of the other finalists.
          This is Trong Van Din and Maria Diminguez.
   Maria and Trong: Hello.
   Faith: Maria is the national spelling bee champion, and Trong has
          won both the Westinghouse Talent Search and the NFL
          Punt, Pass and Kick competition.
   Lisa:  Have either of you ever run into any problems because of your superior
          ability?
   Maria: Mm.
   Trong: Sure, I guess.
   Lisa:  Oh!   Me, too!  [embraces them]
   -- The plight of the superior, ``''
   
 Faith gives the Simpsons their VIP badges.
   
   Faith: These are special VIP badges.  They'll get you into places
          other tourists never see.
   Homer: Miss, what does the `I' stand for?
   Faith: Important.
   Homer: Ooh.  How about the `V'?
   Faith: Very.
   Homer: Oh.  And Miss, just one more question.
   Faith: Person.
   Homer: Ah... What does the `I' stand for again?

 The family see the White House bowling alley...
   
   Bart: [reading a sign]  On this spot, Richard Nixon bowled
         back-to-back 300 games.
   Homer: Yeah, right.
   -- Would he lie to you?  ``''
   
   Marge: Wow, the President's bathroom...
   Lisa:  [opens a curtain, revealing our First Lady in the tub soaking]

 Homer drools when they visit a plant where money is printed.

          Oh, and in case you were wondering, no, we don't give out free samples.
          [tour group chuckles]
   Homer: Lousy cheap country...

 At the National Air and Space Museum, Bart plays furiously with an
 airplane control stick and makes assorted noises.
   
   Homer:  Bart!  Get out of the Spirit of St. Louis!
   -- Or is it Looey?  ``''
   
 While Maggie is dangerously close to floating away on a George Washington
 helium balloon, the family admire the Washington Monument.
   
   Marge: [admiring the Washington Monument]  [chuckles]
   Homer: Hey, what's so funny?
   Marge: [whispers]
   Homer: Oh, Marge, grow up.
   -- Did he say, `up'?  ``''
   
 Meanwhile, in Representative Bob Arnold's office, a lobbyist presents a
 proposal to raze the Springfield National Forest for its timber, supporting
 his argument with artist's renderings.
   
   Well, Jerry, you're a whale of a lobbyist, and I'd like to give you a
   logging permit, I would.  But this isn't like burying toxic waste.  People
   are going to notice those trees are gone.

 Jerry offers a bribe.  Arnold accepts, and says he's got a little place
 that he uses for the drop, but first, Lisa is shown in for a photo session.
   
   Arnold: You must be Lisa Simpson.
   Lisa:   Hello, sir.
   Arnold: Lisa, you're a doer.  And who knows, maybe someday you'll be a
           congressman or a senator.  We have quite a few women senators, you
           know.
   Lisa:   Only two.  I checked.
   Arnold: [chuckles]  You're a sharp one.
   -- Congressman Arnold has met his match?  ``''
   
 The photos are taken.  (Notice Lisa's forced smile in all of them.)
   
   Moe:    [seeing a photo of Congressman Arnold and Lisa in the paper]
           Aw, isn't that nice.  Now &lt;there&gt; is a politician who cares.
   Barney: If I ever vote, it'll be for him!  [belch]
   -- Portrait of a Nonvoter, ``''
   
 Way early in the morning...
   
   Lisa:  I'm too excited to sleep.  Anyone up for the Winifred Beecher Howe
          Memorial?
   Homer: [half asleep]  Who's that?
   Lisa:  An early crusader for women's rights.  She led the Floor Mop Rebellion
          of 1910.  Later, she appeared on the highly unpopular 75-cent piece.
   -- ``''
   
 There are no takers, so she heads there by herself.
   
   ``I will iron your sheets when you iron out the inequities in your labor
   laws.''  Amen, sister.
   -- Lisa reads the inscription on the Winifred Beecher Howe Memorial,
      ``''
   
 She espies Congressman Arnold taking the bribe from Jerry and tears up
 her essay, ``The roots of democracy''.

 Searching for guidance, she heads for the Lincoln Memorial...
   
   Lisa:     [over the strains of the Battle Hymn of the Republic]

             Honest Abe, he'll show me the way.

   Woman:    I can't get my boy to brush proper.
   Man:      Would I look good with a mustache?
   Old man:  [takes of his hat, revealing his bald pate]
             So I tried some turpentine but that just made it worse.
   Lisa:     [trying to make herself heard over the din]
             Mr. Lincoln?  My name is Lisa Simpson, and I have a problem.
   -- ``''
   
 She leaves and talks to the Jefferson Memorial.
   
   Lisa:      Mr. Jefferson, my name is Lisa Simpson, and I have a problem.
   Jefferson: I know your problem.  The Lincoln Memorial was too crowded.
   Lisa:      Sorry, sir.  It's just...
   Jefferson: No one ever comes to see me.  I don't blame them.  I never did
              anything important.  Just the Declaration of Independence,
              the Louisiana Purchase, the dumbwaiter...
   Lisa:      Uh, maybe I should be going.  I've caught you at a bad time...

   Jefferson: Wait!  Please don't go.  I get so lonely...

 Lisa sits on the steps of the Capitol and envisions the politicians as
 cats scratching each other's backs, and pigs feeding from a trough.
 She resolves, ``The truth must be told'' and starts writing...

 Meanwhile, Bart gets a massage and has his laundry delivered.  He writes
 in a $20 tip.  Homer comes in and panics, but Bart reminds him that the
 trip is all-expenses-paid.  Homer joins Bart on the massage table.

 At the Patriots of Tomorrow Awards Banquet at the Kennedy Center, a
 piano-playing political satirist concludes his act.  (Bart complains,
 ``This guy is awful.''  Marge agrees.)  Faith introduces the judges,
 then calls Lisa to the microphone to give her essay.  Lisa storms
 in and takes the microphone.  She announces that she has a new essay,
 and recites a bitter essay on corruption in politics.  She concludes by
 telling of seeing Bob Arnold taking a bribe, and all are aghast.  Word
 gets around...

 EPISODE TITLE: When Flanders Failed


EPISODE SUMMARY: 

 Homer trims his lawn with Ned's weed-whacker (``Property of Ned Flanders''),
 ignoring Ned's comment that at the rate he's going, he'll be out all day.
   
   Ned:   Come on over and strap on the feed bag.  We're going to fire up ol'
          Propane Elaine and put the heat to the meat!  Nummy-nummy-num!
          [hands Homer an invitation]
   Homer: I'll be there!  [sotto voce]  Notty-notty-not.
   -- ``''
   
 At the kitchen table...
   
   The Flanders' are having a beef-a-thon.
   Incredible Ned-ibles.
   Maude-acious vittles.
   -- Lisa reads Ned's barbecue invitation, ``''
   
 Marge tells Homer to give Ned a chance, but Homer maintains that Ned is
 a jerk.  When Marge tries to stick up for Ned, Homer accuses her of being
 the president of the International `We Love Flanders' Fan Club.
 Marge brings the kids and some potato salad to the `Bar-B-Que', but Homer
 is conspicuously absent.  Marge says that Homer has important work at the
 plant that only he can take care of.  Homer is actually lying on the
 family room couch, ostensibly watching ``exciting fifteenth round action
 at the Canadian Football League draft'', but is really grousing.
   
   Stupid Flanders.  Go ahead, Marge.  Have a ball.  What if they came back
   and I was dead from not eating.  They'd cry their eyes out.  [mock crying]
   ``We should have never gone to the Flanders'.  Oh, why did we go to the
   Flanders' house and leave Homer alone with no food?''  And I'll be laughing,
   laughing from my grave, ha ha ha.
   -- Homer really knows how to show 'em, ``''
   
 But he is drawn to the window by the aroma of a flame-broiled burger.
 Bart notices that Homer is drooling out the window and rubs his stomach
 to rub it in.  This proves too much for Homer, who rushes across the lawn
 and helps himself to a tray of hamburgers and a six pack.  Later, Bart
 and other kids play `tag'.  Homer enjoys the kids' insulting epithets.

 Ned calls everyone together to announce that he's quitting his job in
 pharmaceuticals (burning his necktie to demonstrate) and will open a
 shop that sells only left-handed goods.  He'll call it, ``The Leftorium.''

 Later, Ned asks Homer what he thinks of the idea, and Homer has his
 reservations.  Ned knows it's not going to be easy, but it'll be fun.
 Maude comes forward with a wishbone and invites Ned and Homer to make
 a wish.
   
   Hmm, let's see...
   [dreams of newspaper headline: PRESIDENT DECLARES WORLD PEACE]
   Naah...
   [dreams of newspaper headline: PRESIDENT SIMPSON DECLARES WORLD PEACE]
   Mmm...
   [dreams of newspaper headline: PRESIDENT SIMPSON WINS SUPER BOWL]
   Hey!
   -- Homer makes a wish, ``''
   
   Come on, Homer.  I've got an ambition to do some wishin'!

   [dreams of a penniless Ned]
   Ooh!

    a `Going out of business' sign]
   Heh heh heh heh.
   [dreams of a grave with the tombstone, ``RIP Ned Flanders']
   Eh, too far.
   [dreams of Ned shutting down his ``Flanders' Stupid Left-Handed Shop'' with
    a `Going out of business' sign]
   Mm!  Okay, ready.
   -- Homer makes a wish, ``''
   
 Homer wins and gloats.  He then takes a bite out of his hamburger and
 laughs evilly with food splattering out of his mouth.  He starts choking,
 his face turning purple...  Ned prepares to administer the Heimlich
 Maneuver...

 [End of Act One.  Time: 5:02]

 Bart watches another typically violent Itchy &amp; Scratchy cartoon.
   
   Marge: Bart, how many hours a day do you watch TV?
   Bart:  Six.  Seven if there's something good on.
   -- ``''
   
 Marge suggests Bart stop watching TV and get some exercise.
   
   Marge, TV gives so much and asks so little.  It's a boy's best friend.
   -- Homer explains, ``''
   
 They see a TV advertisement for a martial arts school (next to Shakespeare's
 Fried Chicken)...

           rock with sledgehammers]

   Man:   Hai-ya! [breaks a cinder block with his forehead, in the process,
          breaking his glasses, which he forgot to take off]
   Akira: Home makers...
   Woman: Hoi-ya! [breaks a cinder block with her forehead]
   Akira: Landscape architects...
   Woman: Haiiiii-ya!  [breaks a cinder block with her forehead]
   Akira: Choreographers...
   Man:   Hoa!  [breaks a cinder block with his forehead]
   Akira: High karate, at low, low prices.

   -- TV advertisement, ``''
   
 Bart offers to study karate.

 Homer drops Bart off at the martial arts academy, then visits Ned's store.
 A woman accidentally drops a coffee mug, but Ned forgives her.  She then
 asks Ned to validate her parking ticket, which he gladly does.
   
   Absotively posilutely!
   -- Ned Flanders' way of saying, `yes', ``''
   
 Aside from the woman, the store is empty, and Ned hasn't sold a thing yet.
 Meanwhile, Bart suffers through the karate lesson.
   
   Akira: We learn karate, so that we need never use it.
   Bart:  Um, excuse me, sir.  I already know how not to hit a guy.
          Can we break out the nunchucks?
   Akira: Ah yes, the impetuousness of youth.  For now, let us read...
   Bart:  Akira, my good man, when do we break block of ice with our heads?
   Akira: First, you must fill you head with wisdom, then you can hit ice with it.
   Bart:  Yo, sensei.  Can I go to the bathroom?
   Akira: You can if you believe you can.
   Bart:  [leaving]  Pay money to read books, pffft.  The hell with this!
   -- Karate school, ``''
   
 Bart heads for the arcade and plays the `Touch of Death' video game,
 which has a martial arts theme.

 At dinner, Homer gloats that Ned's business is a flop.
   
   Lisa:  Dad, do you know what Schadenfreude is?
   Homer: No, I do not know what shaden-frawde is.
          [sarcasm]  Please tell me, because I'm dying to know.
   Lisa:  It's a German term for `shameful joy', taking pleasure in the suffering
          of others.
   Homer: Oh, come on Lisa.  I'm just glad to see him fall flat on his butt!
          [getting mad]
          He's usually all happy and comfortable, and surrounded by loved ones,
          and it makes me feel...  What's the opposite of that shameful joy
          thing of yours?
   Lisa:  [nastily]  Sour grapes.
   Homer: Boy, those Germans have a word for everything!
   -- Selbstverstaendlich!  ``''
   
 Marge asks Bart what he learned in karate school, and Homer threatens that
 it'd better be worth his ten bucks.  Bart swallows hard, then says he
 learned the `touch of death' and offers to demonstrate on Lisa, who runs in
 fear.
   
   Bart, don't use the Touch of Death on your sister.
   -- Marge, ``''
   
 Bart has snuck out of karate school again and is watching Itchy and Scratchy
 on the TV sets at an electronics store.  He rushes back (causing minor
 havoc among the people whose paths he crosses) in time to emerge from the
 karate school's front door when Homer picks him up.
   
   Homer: Hey, boy!  How was class?
   Bart:  Today, we learned how to rip a man's heart out and show it to him
          before he dies!
   Homer: Ooh.  That'll learn him.
   -- Karate school, ``''
   
 Jimbo, Kerny, and Dolph emerge from Ned's store having shoplifted a
 left-handed shot glass and left-handed pinking shears.  The activity
 has lost its charm for Jimbo, who leaves to steal some baked potatoes from
 the Food Court.

 Homer stop by the store, which is still empty.
   
   Ned: I think word of mouth is starting to spread.
   Man: Hey, I hear you validate parking tickets without purchase.
   Ned: Oh, right as rain!  Or, as we say around here, `left as rain', heh heh.
   Man: Just stamp the ticket.
   Ned: Oh, okay.
   -- ``''
   
 At Moe's Tavern, Barney asks how Ned's business is going, while Moe curses
 the right-handed corkscrew he has to suffer through.  Moe asks what Ned
 sells, and Homer doesn't say.

 At home, Bart keeps threatening Lisa with the `Touch of Death' to get her
 to change the TV channel.

 At work, Homer looks for a candy bar in the vending machine, but all there
 are are apples.  He submits `No more apples in the vending machine please'
 to the suggestion box on Burns' door, and while his hand is still inside,
 Smithers opens the door and tells Homer to bring the box inside.  There,
 he sees Monty struggling with a can opener (presumably to open the tin of
 cat food for the sick-looking cat in his lap).
   
   Burns: And what's your name?
   Homer: Homer Simpson, sir.
   Burns: Simpson, eh?  I'm Monty Burns.
   -- Pleased to meet you, again, ``''
   
   Burns:    [reads an entry in the suggestion box]
             `Keep that handsome owner out of sight,
             he's distracting the female employees'.
             Oh, Smithers...
   Smithers: You got me, sir.
   -- ``''
   
 But he also finds, ``a real one!'' and makes fun of the fact that it's
 not a complete sentence, and lets Homer leave, reassuring him that there
 will be plenty of apples in the future.  He then returns to his tin.
   
   Burns:  Damned infernal gizmo.  My kingdom for a left-handed can opener!
   Homer:  Um, Mr. Burns? ... [dreams of Ned's Leftorium store]
   Ned:    [in Homer's dream]  Come on, Homer, tell him about the store!
           I'm dying out here!
   Homer:  Sorry, Flanders.  [leaves]
   -- ``''
   
 Driving home, Homer sees Ned's belongings strewn on his front lawn.  Ned
 tries to sell his camcorder to a man, unsuccessfully.
   
   Ned:   See anything you like?  [at Ned's lawn sale]
   Homer: Oh, I get it!  It's not good enough for you, but it's good enough
          for me!  Well, I wouldn't be caught dead buying this...  Hello!
   -- Homer espies Ned's gas grill, ``''
   
 Homer offers $20 for Ned's $300 grill.
   
   No cash for Neddy!  Homer keep all money!  Bye-bye Neddy!  Bye bye!
   -- Now go away, or I shall taunt you a second time, ``''
   
 Ned gives in, but Homer holds out
 until Ned throws in a few lawn chairs and a tool bench.  Later, Homer is
 barbecueing in the backyard...
   
   Homer: Hey, Bartly-boobly, care for a steak-a-rooney?
   Bart:  Sounds crumptly-uptious, dear old duddly-doodly!
   Homer: Heh heh, duddly-doodly.
   -- Talking like Ned Flanderoosky, ``''
   
 Marge is surprised to find Ned's living room set in the backyard, which
 Homer says he paid only $75 for.
   
   I'm sure &lt;you&gt; did nothing to discourage this, you scavenger of human misery.
   -- Lisa, ``''
   
 Homer answers the door...
   
   Chuck: Good afternoon, sir.  I'm Chuck Ellis, from the Springfield Collection
          Agency, and I'm here to ask you why you don't think you need to pay
          your bills.
   Homer: Oh, I know I need to pay them, but there's just so many!
   Chuck: Does it make you feel good about yourself to owe people money?
          We've been very patient with you, Mr. Flanders.
   Homer: I know, but... Wait a minute, I'm Homer Simpson.  Ned Flanders lives
          over there.  Flanders is in debt?  Are you sure?
   Chuck: Ha.  We don't make mistakes.
   -- ``''
   
 Chuck warns, ``See you on Thursday,'' before leaving.
 Homer drops Bart off at karate school, who immediately sneaks out.
 Homer sees Ned closing his Leftorium; he's gone out of business.

 [End of Act Two.  Time: 14:32]

 On the playground, Lisa plays her sax, and Jimbo, Kerny and Dolph take it
 and play keep-away with it.  She runs off in tears, then finds Bart.  She
 introduces Bart to the boys, threatening, ``He knows karate.''  Bart tries
 talk his way out of it, but ends up hanging from a basketball hoop.
 Below, Lisa holds her sax, noting, ``It's funny how two wrongs sometimes
 make a right.''

 Homer comes home to see that the bank has foreclosed on Ned's house, so
 the Flanderses are temporarily living in their car before they go to his
 sister's apartment in Capital City.  While the kids sing `Put on a Happy
 Face', Ned calls Homer aside...
   
   Ned:   At times like these, I used to turn to the Bible and find solace,
          but even the Good Book can't help me now.
   Homer: Why not?
   Ned:   I sold it to you for seven cents.
   Homer: Oh.
   -- ``''
   
 Ned notes that it seems, ever since the barbecue, there's been a curse on
 him.  Homer cries and admits that it's all his fault, but Ned calls Homer
 a true friend because he tried to warn him not to go into business from the
 start.
   
   Homer: Listen, Flanders, you still have that store?
   Ned:   For two more days. [sniff]  It becomes Libertarian Party headquarters.
          I hope they have better luck than I did.
   -- Fat chance, ``''
   
 Homer orders Ned to open his shop tomorrow, then starts spreading the word
 about Ned's store.  He calls Jerry, Moe, Barney...
   
   `Kiss me, I'm left-handed''?  [laughs]  Oh, that's a classic!  [laughs]
   Whoa! [falls off the table]
   -- Barney, bastion of balance, ``''
   
 Monty Burns continues struggling with his can opener, then finds a note
 in his suggestion box.  ``To the mall!  I'll explain on the way!''

 Ned dejectedly rides the escalator to his store, where he finds the store
 teeming with customers.
   
   It's all here, and it's all backwards!
   -- Homer hypes Ned's Leftorium, ``''
   
   Burns:  [talking to a tin can]
           Ah, the worm has turned, has it not, my tin-plated friend?
           Look at you, you were once so proud.  Feel the wrath of
           the left hand of Burns!
   Moe:    My life begins today!
   Barney: [wearing a `Kiss me, I'm left-handed' shirt]  Wow, what an icebreaker!
           [two pretty girls kiss him]
   Chuck:  Left-handed ledgers!  Now I can write all the way to the edge!
   Akira:  Ha ha ha.  Left-handed nunchucks!
   -- Shopping at the Leftorium, ``''
   
 Burns approaches the register with an armful of left-handed can openers,
 and tops it off by purchasing the car with the left-handed gear shift.
   
   Homer, affordable tract housing made us neighbors, but you made us friends.
   -- Ned, ``''
   
 The Todd-meister leads everyone in a rendition of `Put on a Happy Face',
 accompanied, of course, on the left-handed guitar.  (Personally, I think
 it'd have been better if he had played the left-handed zither.)

 EPISODE TITLE: Bart the Murderer


EPISODE SUMMARY: 

 Bart wakes up bright and chipper (though he steps on a toy as he gets
 out of bed).  At breakfast...
   
   Bart:  Looks like I've got me a genuine glow-in-the-dark police badge!
          [hunts through the box of cereal]
          Hey, it's not in here.  You stole it!
   Lisa:  No one wants your stupid police badge, Bart.
   Homer: [coming in] Hey, look what I got!  A genuine official police badge!
          ``Calling all cars!  Come out with your hands up!'' Heh heh heh.
   Bart:  Hey, that's my badge, Homer.
   Homer: That's &lt;Officer&gt; Homer!  Hee hee hee hee.
   -- ``''
   
 Bart returns to his room to find SLH chewing up his homework.  (9 x 9 = 100)
   
   You ate my homework!?  I didn't know dogs &lt;really&gt; did that...
   -- Bart to Santa's Little Helper, ``''
   
 He sees Lisa boarding the school bus out his room window and rushes out,
 only to have the bus doors close in his face.  Lisa waves good-bye from
 the bus window.  The second the bus pulls away, storm clouds roll in, and
 it starts pouring.  A car splashes him as he walks to school.  When he
 gets to the school building, the storm suddenly clears.  (D'oh!)
   
   Ms.K: Bart Simpson, you're late.  Go fill out a tardy slip.
   Bart: But I'm only five... [looks at the clock]  ten, twenty...
         Forty minutes!  That's pretty damn late!
   -- ``''
   
 On the playground, Bart is on the monkey bars and says,
 ``Hey girls, look at me!''  But he rips his pants while trying to do a
 stunt.  ``You can stop looking at me now.''  A stray football hits him,
 and he falls to the ground.  It's nearly 1pm, and the class are excited
 about their field trip to the chocolate factory.  Everyone, that is,
 except Bart, who suddenly realizes that he left his permission slip at home.
   
   Lisa:   I'm going to eat eight pieces of chocolate!
   Ralph:  I'm going to each chocolate 'til I barf!
   -- Know when to say when, ``''
   
 Meanwhile...
   
   Principal Skinner:  Here's a whole box of unsealed envelopes for the PTA!
   Bart: You're making me lick envelopes?
   P.S.: Oh, licking envelopes can be fun!  All you have to do is make a game
         of it.
   Bart: What kind of game?
   P.S.: Well, for example, you could see how many you could lick in an hour,
         then try to break that record.
   Bart: Sounds like a pretty crappy game to me.
   P.S.: Yes, well... Get started.
   -- ``''
   
 The kids greet `Cocoa-Beanie' at the ``Ah Fudge!'' factory.
   
   I think this is something Bart would really have enjoyed.
   But it's the only way he'll learn...
   -- Lisa, ``''
   
 The kids watch another of those educational films.
   
   Welcome to the Chocolate Factory.  I'm Troy McClure!  You probably remember
   me from such films as `The Revenge of Abe Lincoln', and `The Wackiest
   Covered Wagon in the West'.
   -- ``''
   
   [haunting native American music plays, scene changes to an Aztec pyramid]
   The history of chocolate begins with the ancient Aztecs.
   [see a hand holding an `Ah Fudge' candy bar]
   In those days, instead of being wrapped in a hygienic package,
   chocolate was wrapped in a tobacco leaf.
   [candy bar changes to a coiled tobacco leaf]
   And instead of being pure chocolate, like we have today, it was
   mixed with shredded tobacco.
   [pull back to see a smiling Aztec fellow holding the cigar-shaped tobacco leaf]
   And they didn't eat it, they smoked it!
   [Aztec lights it, takes a puff, and smiles broadly]
   -- Educational film at the chocolate factory, ``''
   
 Bart continues licking the envelopes, and watches the second-hand on the
 wall clock tick, ever so slowly.  (In fact, it even ticks backwards.)
 Meanwhile, the kids frolic absurdly in the factory.  It's nearly 3pm,
 and Bart's tongue is bone dry.  He asks, ``Cad I doe dow?''  Principal
 Skinner can't understand him, so he writes his request (left-handed).
 Principal Skinner lets Bart go a minute early.  Once Bart steps outside,
 it starts raining again.  He skateboards home, and the bus (returning
 from the field trip) splashes him.  Then the wheel falls off his skateboard
 and he tumbles down a stairwell.  ``What next?'' he sarcastically asks
 himself.  Bart finds himself on the wrong end of a dozen gun barrels.
 ``Uh oh.''

 [End of Act One.  Time:  4:43]

 Fat Tony and the other members of the Legitimate Businessman's Social Club
 see if Bart can be of any use to them...
   
   Tony: Pick a horse, kid.  We're putting two dollars on the third race.
         Make it a good one.
   Bart: Eat my shorts!
   Tony: Eat My Shorts?  Ah, okay... [consults the racing form]
         Let's see... Wait a minute, you little punk!  Eat My Shorts is
         in the fifth race!  I said the &lt;third&gt; race!
   Bart: Don't have a cow!
   Tony: Mm.. [to a fellow crony] Don't Have a Cow in the third,
         put a deuce on him.
   -- ``''
   
 While they're waiting for the race to run, Tony shows Bart the bar,
 the slot machine, and the card table.  The men listen to the horse race.
   
   As they come out of the turn, it's Sufferin' Succotash by a neck over
   Yabba-Dabba-Doo, two lengths back Ooh Ain't I a Stinker and That's All Folks.
   I Yam What I Yam can see them all, but here comes Don't Have a Cow flying on
   the outside, and coming down to the wire, it's all Don't Have a Cow!
   -- The third race, ``''
   
 Tony says, ``Hey, I like this kid.  I can't believe we were going to shoot
 him!''  Bart is ordered to mix a Manhattan.  He looks up the recipe and does
 so.  They like it.  (``Soopoib.'')

 At home, Bart tells Marge that he has a job.  Marge isn't sure, considering
 what he's paid to do, and asks Homer (who is eating directly out of a
 `Le Gourmet' tub of chocolate ice cream) to say something.
   
   Homer: How much does it pay?
   Bart:  Thirty bucks a week!
   Homer: Pfft!  I make more than that.
   -- Bart gets a part-time job, ``''
   
 Bart continues to work for the Social Club and is generously tipped by
 the clientele.  We see them playing poker, and all of them are cheating
 ridiculously.  Doing the laundry, Marge finds $100 bills in Bart's
 clothes.  Bart snatches the money.  ``I was looking for those.  Thanks,
 doll.''  Bart introduces the Legitimate Businessmen to Itchy and Scratchy.
   
   It's funny because it's true.
   -- Fat Tony, ``''
   
 Chief Wiggum comes in...
   
   Fat Tony:     Chief Wiggum!  You honor us with your presence.
   Chief Wiggum: Baloney!  I'm not going to rest until one of us is behind bars.
                 You!  You wouldn't happen to know anything about a cigarette
                 truck that got hijacked on Route 401?
   Fat Tony:     What's a truck?
   Chief Wiggum: Don't play dumb with me!
   -- ``''
   
 He adds that ``the boy here makes an excellent Manhattan.''  He offers one to
 Chief Wiggum, who drinks it and likes it.

 Homer sees Bart's room piled to the ceiling with cigarettes and concludes
 that Bart has started smoking.  Bart insists they're not his, but Homer
 doesn't believe him.  He threatens to make Bart smoke every single one
 of them while he watches.  Just then, a delivery man comes by to pick up
 the cigarettes, and Homer says, ``Son, I'll never doubt you again.''

 At a press conference, Chief Wiggum explains that 12,000 cartons of
 Laramie 100's were stolen.
   
   Wiggum: Let me assure all you smokers out there, there is &lt;no&gt;
           shortage of cigarettes.
   Reporter: [shouts]  How do we know that?
   Wiggum: Um, let me refer that question back to Jack Larson, Laramie Tobacco
           Products.  Jack?
   Jack:   Thank you, Chief.  Folks, I'm pleased to announce that a new truckload
           of Laramie's, with their smoooooth good taste of fresh tobacco
           flavor is already heading towards Springfield.  The driver &lt;has&gt; been
           instructed to ignore all stop signs and crosswalks. [all cheer]
   -- Press conference, ``''
   
 Kent Brockman adds that police suspect the involvement of reputed mobster
 William ``Fat Tony'' Williams.
   
   Fat Tony is a cancer on this fair city.
   He is the cancer, and I am the... um...  What cures cancer?
   -- Chief Wiggum, ``''
   
   Lisa: [somewhat shocked] Bart, is your boss a crook?
   Bart: I don't think so.  Although it would explain an awful lot.
   -- ``''
   
 At work, Fat Tony gives Bart a present, in gratitude for his help with
 the cigarettes.
   
   Bart: Uh, say, are you guys crooks?
   Tony: Bart, um, is it wrong to steal a loaf of bread to feed your starving
         family?
   Bart: No.
   Tony: Well, suppose you got a large starving family.  Is it wrong to steal
         a truckload of bread to feed them?
   Bart: Uh uh.
   Tony: And, what if your family don't like bread?  They like... cigarettes?
   Bart: I guess that's okay.
   Tony: Now, what if instead of giving them away, you sold them at a price
         that was practically giving them away.  Would that be a crime, Bart?
   Bart: Hell, no!
   Tony: Enjoy your gift.
   -- What if he puts jelly on it?  ``''
   
 Bart gets a tailored suit.  (``Soopoib.'')  He wears it proudly and sings
 `Witchcraft' around the house.
   
   Give me three fingers of milk, Ma.
   -- Bart, ``''
   
 That evening, Marge expresses her concerns about Bart's job to Homer...
   
   Marge: I'm not sure about the people Bart's working for.
          I think they're criminals.
   Homer: A job's a job.  I mean, take me.  If my plant pollutes the water
          and poisons the town, by your logic, that would make me a criminal.
   -- Guilt by association?  ``''
   
   Marge: That pizza delivery truck has been parked across the street for
          two weeks.  [looking at a pizza delivery truck conspicuously
          equipped with a satellite dish]
   [inside the truck, loaded with electronic snooping equipment]
   Marge's voice:  How long does it take to deliver a pizza?
   Man 1: Looks like our cover's blown.
   Man 2: Let's roll.  [the truck speeds off]
   [back in the bedroom]
   Homer: See?  It was all your imagination.
   [another truck pulls into the spot that was vacated.  The sign painted
    on the side?   Flowers

                   Irene]
   -- ``''
   
 Marge prevails upon Homer to pay Bart's employers a visit, to see what
 they're like.  He does so...
   
   Homer: [playing poker]
          Heh heh!  Read 'em and weep, boys.  Another pair of sixes!
   Tony:  [folding with five aces]  Beats me.
   Man:   I was... bluffing.
   -- ``''
   
   Tony:  I am thrilled you decided to let your boy continue to work here.
   Homer: You know, if you need a hat-check girl, I've got a daughter.
   Tony:  Homer, you're a helluva father.
   -- ``''
   
 Homer returns home and tells Marge everything is square.  At school, Bart
 supervises a ``I am still a weiner'' graffito, and when Skinner asks what's
 up, he slips some cash into his pocket.  Inside, Skinner watches Bart
 write, ``I will not bribe Principal Skinner'' on the blackboard...

 At the club, The Big Cheese notes that he was invited to try some of
 the finest Manhattans in all of Springfield, but Tony's bartender isn't
 in.  Tony tells Louie to make some, which he does, poorly.  The Big Cheese
 gives Tony the Kiss of Death and leaves.  Bart finally arrives and puts on
 his apron, grousing about Skinner.  Tony learns that Skinner held Bart after
 school, and he offers to ``meet and greet this individual.''  Bart pours
 himself a shot of milk.

 At school...
   
   Secretary: Some large men to see you, sir.
   Skinner:   Um, I don't have any appointment with any large men.
              [Fat Tony and two heavies come in]
   Fat Tony:  You Skinner?
   Skinner:   I'm &lt;Principal&gt; Skinner, yes.  And how, may I ask, did you get
              past the hall monitors?
   -- ``''
   
 The next day, Bart chuckles as he draws a sketch of Skinner hanging from
 a noose.  Ms. Krabappel tells the class, ``Principal Skinner is...
 missing!''  The class cheers.  Except for Bart, who merely says, ``Uh oh.''

 [End of Act Two.  Time: 13:22]

 The search for Skinner continues...  A river is dredged. Posters are, er,
 posted.  (``Have you seen my body today?'')
   
   I can assure you that we're using the most advanced scientific techniques
   in the field of... [searching for the word]  body-finding.
   -- Police Chief Wiggum's briefing, ``''
   
 A psychic joins the Skinner hunt.
   
   Gypsy:  [roaming her hands over a picture of Skinner]
           I see wedding bells for Vanna White and Teddy Kennedy.
   Wiggum: Please, Princess Opal, if we could just stick to Principal Skinner.
   Gypsy:  Chief Wiggum, I am merely a conduit for the spirits.
           [gasp]  Willie Nelson will astound his fans by swimming
           the English Channel.
   Wiggum: Really?  Willie Nelson?
   -- Would she lie to you?  ``''
   
 The Seymour Skinner Memorial Fire Hose is dedicated.  (``He loved fire
 drills...'' notes Ms. Krabappel.)
   
   Lewis:    [covered in leaves]  Hey, look at me.  I'm Skinner's body!
   Bart:     That is not funny, Lewis.
   Milhouse: Well, I heard Skinner's buried under his parking spot.
   Student:  Well, I heard he was ground up into hamburger and served to us
             at lunch.
   Nelson:   I heard Bart had Skinner killed by gangsters.
   Bart:     That's not true!  It's just a rumor.  You're engaged in speculation.
             I know the law, you can't prove anything.
   -- He was like that when I got there.  ``''
   
 Bart is tormented by a nightmare wherein Skinner's body keeps appearing
 and saying, ``You killed me, Bart!''  Bart is thrown into jail (the
 ``Death House'').
   
   Bart: Reverend Lovejoy!  You've, you've come to comfort me?
   Rev.: Yes, Bart.  [pats Bart]  [emotionlessly]  There there.
         [pats some more]  There there.
   -- An enormous help, ``''
   
 Outside the prison, a crowd (including Homer) demands Bart's death.
 Bart is placed in the electric chair, atop some telephone books, and
 the switch is pulled.  Bart wakes up in fright.

 Bart goes to the club early in the morning...
   
   Bart: Did you kill my principal?
   Tony: Uh, Chinese guy with a moustache?
   -- ``''
   
 He says he didn't kill Skinner.  Chief Wiggum bursts in and arrests them
 all for the murder of Seymour Skinner.

 In jail (just like how Bart dreamed), Homer and Marge pay a visit...
   
   Oh Bart, why couldn't you have gotten a paper route like other boys?
   -- Marge, when Bart is arrested for murder, ``''
   
   Bart: What's that guy doing here?

   Smithers: That Simpsons boy is looking at 180 years.
   Burns:    Thank God we live in a country so hysterical over crime that a
             ten-year-old child can be tried as an adult.
   -- ``''
   
 At the trial...
   
   Tony: I didn't order this Skinner guy killed...
   D.A.: But aren't you the head of this gang?
   Tony: No.  I just stop by the club occasionally to read the complimentary
         newspaper.
   D.A.: Then who is the kingpin, the capo del tutti capi?
         [Literally, ``The head of all heads''.]
   Tony: That's the guy!  [fingers Bart]
   All:  [gasp]
   Bart: Hey!
   Tony: Forgive me, Don Bartholomew.
   -- Is... ``''
   
 The other testimony is similar, all implicating Bart as the head of the
 operation.
   
   Hutz:  Mr. Simpson, you've been the boy's father for ten years.
          Do you really think he could be the leader of a murderous
          criminal syndicate?
   Homer: Well, not the leader, I mean... [looks over at Bart]
          [cries]  Oh, it's true, it's true!
          All the pieces fit! [bawls]

   Now, in light of the damning testimony from your fellow gangsters, your
   father, your teachers, and the seemingly endless parade of emotionally
   shattered babysitters...
   -- The Judge's summing-up, ``''
   
 But before he passes sentence, Principal Skinner bursts in, disheveled.
 He tells his story:  Tony and his goons came to talk and he threw them
 out.  He went home and began bundling his old newspapers, but the stack
 fell on him.  (``Let this be a lesson to recycle regularly.'')  Trapped
 until the pile of papers, he survived the week by eating his mother's
 preserves and preserved his sanity by dribbling a basketball that was
 barely within reach of his one free hand.  (``I made a game of it.  Seeing
 how many times I could bounce the ball in a day, then trying to break that
 record.'')  When the police came to search the house...
   
   Wiggum: Find anything this time, boys?
   Cop:    Uh, no sign of him, Chief.
   Wiggum: Princess Opal?
   Opal:   I see nothing here, but I'm afraid it's splitsville for Delta
           Burke and Major Dad.
   Wiggum: But they seem so happy!
   -- ``''
   
 ... he called out, but they didn't hear him.  So he used a little
 fourth-grade chemistry to build a rocket, which he attached to a
 vacuum cleaner cord, and which wrapped the cord around a support beam.
 He then switched on the cord retraction on the vacuum cleaner, which
 pulled him to safety.  He concludes his story, and all cheer.
 The D.A. asks that Skinner's testimony be struck from the record,
 unsuccessfully.
   
   Judge: Case dismissed!
   Hutz:  Your honor... Do I still get paid?

   Tony: Hey Bart, I hope there are no hard feelings.
   Bart: Get bent.
   Tony: I deserved that.

   Tony: Me and the boys, we still think you got a big future in racketeering
         and extortion.
   Bart: Sorry, Fat Tony.  I used to think your gang was cool.  But now
         I learned that crime doesn't pay.
   Tony: Yeah, you're right.  [leaves in his expensive limo, complete with
         pretty woman]
   -- Do as I say... ``''
   
 At home, the family watch TV.
   
   Announcer:  Blood on the Blackboard!  The Bart Simpson story!
       Starring Richard Chamberlain as Principal Skinner, Joe Montegna
       as Fat Tony, Jane Seymour as the woman he loved, and TV's Doogie
       Howser, Neil Patrick Harris, as Bart Simpson!
   `Tony':  Bart, I'm scared.  Let's get out of here.
   `Bart':  Shut up!  Where do you want it, Skinner?
   `Skinner':  [spits on him]
   `Bart':  Not smart.  [pumps him full of lead]
   Bart:  Cool!
   Homer: Hey, when do we get the check for this?
   Marge: Well, they said they changed it just enough so they don't have to
          pay us.
   Homer: Oh, you know who the &lt;real&gt; crooks are?  Those sleazy Hollywood
          producers!

 EPISODE TITLE: Homer Defined


EPISODE SUMMARY: 

 Homer and Lisa read US of A TODAY over breakfast.
   
   Homer: Here's good news!  According to this eye-catching article,
          SAT scores are declining at a slower rate!
   Lisa:  Dad, I think this paper is a flimsy hodgepodge of pie graphs,
          factoids and Larry King.
   Homer: Hey, this is the only paper in America that's not afraid to tell
          the truth, that everything is just fine.
   -- Reading US of A TODAY, ``''
   
 Bart puts the finishing touches on a birthday card...
   
   Bart: [inscribing a card]
         ``To me bestest bud, Milhouse.  Happy Birthday.  Bart.''
   Lisa: Bart, that's so sweet.  May I see the card?  [reads]  ``Hey there,
         ten-year-old!  I couldn't afford to get you a new drum...''
         [opens the card, revealing a picture of a well-endowed woman]
         [reading with lost enthusiasm]  ``So how about a nice pair of
         bongos''?  Ewww...
   -- Amen, sister, ``''
   
 On the bus, Bart presents Milhouse with a wrapped gift and begs him to
 open it.  Milhouse is reluctant to, and Bart says, ``Just 'cuz your mom
 didn't let you have a party doesn't mean you can't get a present!''
 Sherry and Terry say, ``We had a lovely time on Saturday, Milhouse.''
 When Bart asks, ``What are you girls talking about?'' they return to
 their seats and giggle.  Milhouse opens the present...
   
   They're official Krusty the Clown walkie-talkies!
   I'll keep one and you keep one.
   Now, whenever you want to talk to me, just call me on the phone
   and tell me to turn on my walkie-talkie.
   -- Bart, explaining his gift to Milhouse, ``''
   
 Martin peeks over the seat.
   
   Martin:   Milhouse, I'd like to express my appreciation for Saturday.
             Jelly bean basket, personalized noisemakers.
             But the little touches are what made it enduring!
   Bart:     What's he talking about?
   Milhouse: Uh... Hey!  Look at that dog!  Isn't that something!
   Bart:     [sees a rather plain dog] Wow, brown!
   -- How to change the subject, method 3.  ``''
   
 The bus reaches the school...
   
   Whoa, Springfield Elementary, last stop!
   Oh, and by the way, I'd like to say Thanks, and applose[?] applause to
   birthday boy Milhouse for his totally bitchin' party on Saturday!
   Oh, and Milhouse, I think I left my pants on your roof.
   -- Otto's announcement (emergencies only), ``''
   
   Bye, little dudes!  Don't learn anything I wouldn't learn!
   -- Otto drops the kids off at school, ``''
   
 Bart is left alone on the bus.  Meanwhile, at the plant, Burns and Smithers
 survey the various security monitors...
   
   Burns:    So, what did you do this weekend, Smithers?
   Smithers: Well, I caught up on my laundry, wrote a letter to my mother,
             oh, here a kicker, and I took Hercules out to be clipped.
   Burns:    Who the devil is Hercules?
   Smithers: Oh, he's my Yorkshire terrier, sir.  He's kind of tiny, so you
             know, it's a joke.  Here's a picture of Herky. [shows a wallet
             photo]
   Burns:    Ugh.  Well, Smithers, don't you know how to paint the town red!
   -- Hercules and the Lion?  ``''
   
   Burns:    I took in a movie.  An appalling little piece of filth.
             Its leading lady was a blonde harlot who spent half the
             film strolling around naked as a jaybird!
   Smithers: [gasp]
   Burns:    No, just give the Great Unwashed a pair of oversized breasts
             and a happy ending, and they'll oink for more every time.
   [Homer talking with his coworkers]
   Homer:   What a movie!  And that blonde cutie!  Does she have assets! [oinks]
   -- Wallowing in filth, ``''
   
 In his safety control room, Homer pokes at all the donuts...
   
   [poking at each jelly donut in turn]
   [poke]  Igh, lemon.  [poke]  Ugh, cherry.  [poke]  Ooh, custard.
   [poke]  Mmmmm.... purple...
   -- Homer, enjoying the finer things in life, ``''
   
 In his dough-nutty enjoyment, some jelly splatters and covers a
 dial, which is nearing the red zone.  Meanwhile, Otto skids the
 bus into the Kwik-E-Mart and heads for a heat-lamp dog.
   
   Apu:  Otto, do you know there's a small child inside your bus?
   Otto: [sees Bart] Ooh, good thing you warned me.  I was on my way to Mexico!
   -- Tijuana Schoolbus, ``''
   
 Meanwhile, while Homer dozes at his station, the jelly covers up the
 dial which we presume has since gone into the danger zone.  Our
 presumptions prove true when Burns hears a polite female
 voice announce...
   
   Voice:    Warning... Problem in Sector 7-G.
   Burns:    7-G?  Good God, who's the safety inspector there?
   Smithers: [calls up a video file photo of a hairful Homer]
             Homer Simpson, sir.
   Burns:    Simpson, eh?  Good man?  Intelligent?
   Smithers: [reluctantly]  Actually, sir, he was hired under Project Bootstrap.
   Burns:    [sarcastically]  Thank you, President Ford.
   -- Quality is Job One, ``''
   
 Homer wakes up to the sound of loud rhythmic buzzing (see SI, Summer'91)...
   
   Homer: [waking up to the sound of loud rhythmic buzzing]
          Huh? ... Noise! ... Bad noise!
   Voice: [calmly] Five minutes before critical mass...
   Homer: Critical what!?  [trying to calm down]
          Okay, okay, don't panic, whosever problem this is, I'm sure they
          know how to handle it...  [the jelly covering the dial pops off]
          Huh?  Aaagh!!  It's &lt;my&gt; problem!!!  We're doomed!!!!
   Voice: [as steel doors seal off the safety control room]
          [calmly] Sector 7-G is now being isolated...
   -- It has been our pleasure to serve you, ``''
   
 Otto drops Bart off at school.
   
   You know, once, my old lady ran off and married my brother.
   Well, it hurt, but here it is a month later, and I'm sleeping on
   their couch!
   -- Otto-Man, ``''
   
 Marge sits on the couch knitting and watching a smarmy soap with Maggie.
 But the show is interrupted by a special news bulletin...
   
   Announcer: We interrupt `Search for the Sun' for this special news bulletin.
              Meltdown Crisis:  The First Couple of Minutes.
   Brockman:  [surrounded by comb and hair dryer]  Forget the hair, just give
              me the blush!  [realizes the cameras are on him]  Oh, we're on.
   -- Ready for anything, ``''
   
 They have Monty Burns on the phone, as a picture of a badly-toupee'd
 Monty is shown on the screen.
   
   Kent:  On the line with us now is plant owner C. Montgomery Burns.  Mr. Burns?
   Burns: Oh, hello, Kent.  [as loud rhythmic buzzing continues in the background]
          Right now, skilled nuclear energy technicians are calmly correcting
          a minor, piffling malfunction.  [rapid-fire shots of havoc in the plant]
          But I can assure you and the public that there is absolutely no danger
          whatsoever.  [air raid siren wails]  Things couldn't be more ship-shape.
          [cut to Burns' office, where he is busy donning a radiation suit]
   Smithers:  Sir, where is &lt;my&gt; radiation suit?
   Burns: How the hell should I know?  [covers the name `Smithers' on the suit
          he is wearing]
   Kent:  Uh, Mr. Burns, people are calling this a meltdown.
   Burns: [laughs] Oh, meltdown.  It's one of those annoying buzzwords.  We prefer
          to call it an unrequested fission surplus.
   -- Obfuscatory sesquipedalianism, ``''
   
 Marge hopes that Homer is all right.  In the safety control room...
   
   Homer: [panicking, as warning sirens wail]  Gotta think, gotta think...
          Okay, somewhere there's a thingie that tells you how to work this
          stuff.  The uh, the uh, the manual!  The manual!  Right!
          [hunts under the console] [finds it]
          Agh!  It's as fat as a phone book!  [opens to first page]  [reads]
          `Congratulations on your purchase of a Fissionator 1952 Slow-Fission
          Reactor'...  D'oh!  Get to the point, man!  [finds an insert]
          Ooh, what's this?  [unfolds it, it's a giant schematic]
          D'oh!  Who'd have thought a nuclear reactor would be so complicated!
   -- Everything is under control, sort of, ``''
   
   Voice:    [cheerfully] Ninety seconds to core meltdown.
   Smithers: Sir, there may be never be another time to say... I love you, sir.
   Burn:     [disgusted]  Oh, hot dog.  Thank you for making my last few moment
             on earth socially awkward.
   -- The moment of truth, ``''
   
 At Moe's Tavern...
   
   Moe:    Looks like this is the end...
   Barney: Oh, that's all right.  I couldn'ta led a richer life.
   -- Core meltdown is imminent, ``''
   
 At the Retirement Castle, Abe, Jasper, and a woman watch TV...
   
   Kent:   After the meltdown, we can expect roving bands of...
   Abe:    Ah, I don't like this program.
   Jasper: Change the channel.
           [woman does so]
   TV:     Wheel!  Of!  Fortune!!
   -- Dame Fortune smiles, ``''
   
 Meanwhile, Homer complains that he doesn't understand &lt;anything&gt;.
 ``When they look up `stupid' in the dictionary, there'll be a picture
 of me.''  He then dreams of exactly that.  At home...
   
   Marge: [praying]  Dear Lord.  If you spare this town from becoming
          a smoking hole in the ground, I'll try to be a better Christian.
          I don't know what I can do... Mm... Oh, the next time there's
          a canned food drive, I'll give the poor something they'd actually
          like, instead of old lima beans and pumpkin mix.
   -- Throw in a coupla Hail Mary's and we might have a deal, ``''
   
 Homer realizes it's all up to him, and tries to think back to his
 training...
   
   Homer:   Okay okay, think back to your training...
            [begin flashback]
   Trainer: Now, Homer, this may very well save your life one day.
            This... Homer?
   Homer:   [playing with a Rubik's cube]  Yeah?
   Trainer: Please pay attention.  This button here controls the emergency
            override circuit.  In the event of a meltdown, push this button
            and only this button.
   Homer:   [completing a side of the cube]  Ooh, a side!
   Trainer: Simpson!
   Homer:   What?
   Trainer: You see which button I'm pushing?
   Homer:   [not looking]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Push the button.  Got it.
            [end flashback]
            This is all your fault!  [throws Rubik's cube away]
   -- Well, at least he remembered the general idea, ``''
   
 Realizing that he has no better option, he plays ``One potato, two
 potato'', then changes to ``Bubble gum, bubble gum''...
   
   Voice:    [pleasantly]  Thirty seconds to core meltdown.
   Burns:    Oh, Smithers, I guess there's nothing left but to kiss
             my sorry ass good-bye.
   Smithers: May I, sir?
   Burns:    Ugh.
   -- Just asking, ``''
   
 On TV...
   
   Prof. John Fink:  [indicating on a map]  These unfortunate people here will
          be instantly killed.  [indicating]  This circle, which I am sad to say
          we are in, will experience a slower, considerably more painful death.
   Kent:  Good Lord!
   -- Analyzed to death?  ``''
   
 At school, Lisa's class is huddled under their desks...
   
   Skinner:  They called me old-fashioned for teaching the duck-and-cover
       method, but who's laughing now!
   -- ``''
   
 The computer cheerfully announces, ``Fifteen seconds to core meltdown.''
 Homer has settled on ``Eenie, meenie, miney, moe'' to decide which
 button to push.  He reaches the end of the rhyme, covers his eyes, and
 pushes the button...

 [End of Act One.  Time: 8:33]
   
   Voice:  All systems returning to normal.  Danger in 7-G neutralized.
           Have a nice day.
   -- It's been a pleasure serving you, ``''
   
 Homer sees himself in the dictionary under `Lucky'.  The workers rejoice.
   
   Man:   [emerges from closet, fixing his tie]
   Woman: Will I ever see you again?
   Man:   Sure, baby.  Next meltdown.
   -- ``''
   
 Abe et al are still watching Wheel of Fortune...
   
   TV:   I'd like to solve the puzzle.  `Three Loins in the Fountain'.  [buzz]
   -- Wheel of Misfortune, ``''
   
 Marge watches the news report...
   
   Burns:  [voice only]
           Yes, we've isolated the problem.  Wouldn't you know, false alarm.
   Marge:  Phew!
   Burns:  It seems a single wayward crow flew into our warning system.
   Kent:   Very good.  Well, sir, your point about nuclear hysteria is well-taken.
           This reporter promises to be more trusting and less vigilant
           in the future.
   Burns:  [in his office, still wearing his radiation suit]
           Excellent.  Well, ta!
   -- Hardly a post-apocalyptic war zone, ``''
   
 Burns asks Smithers to bring him a wine spritzer, and notes that he's
 going to award Homer the Employee of the Month award.  Smithers drops
 the bottle.

 Meanwhile, at lunch, Bart pulls the ol' loose-top-on-the-salt-shaker
 trick on Milhouse, to get back at him for not inviting him to his
 birthday party.
   
   Milhouse: Bart, my mom won't let me be your friend any more.
             That's why you couldn't come to the party.
   Bart:     What's she got against me?
   Milhouse: She says you're a bad influence.
   Bart:     [slams his hand on the table]  Bad influence, my ass!
             How many times have I told you?  Never listen to your mother!
   -- What he said, ``''
   
 Mrs. Van Houten threatened to cut off Milhouse's allowance, and
 Bart offers to pay him double it.  But Milhouse doesn't accept.

 Meanwhile, Smithers tries to convince Burns that he deserves the EotM
 award, but Burns' mind is made up.  In the cafeteria...
   
   Karl:  Hey, way to save our lives!
   Len:   Yeah, we owe you one!
   Homer: Yeah, you know, boys, a nuclear reactor is a lot like a woman.
          You just have to read the manual and press the right buttons.
   -- ``''
   
 Burns arrives and simply says to Homer, ``Come with me.''

 As the audience chants, ``Homer!  Homer!'', he is given the EotM award,
 receiving a ham, a plaque, and discount coupon book from a voluptuous
 woman, a thumbs-up from Burns, and his picture (the old one, back when
 Homer had some hair) added to the `Wall of Fame', which we see consists
 otherwise entirely of photos of Smithers.  And...
   
   Burns: Oh, and what's this?  A congratulatory phone call from Earvin
          `Magic' Johnson?
   Homer: [gasps]  Magic Johnson!?  [picks up the phone]  Yello?
   Magic: [calling from the arena]  Is this really Homer Simpson?
   Homer: Yeah.
   Magic: Wow.  Homer, I just used our last time-out to call and congratulate
          you on averting that nuclear holocaust.
   -- On his way to Disneyland, ``''
   
 Homer asks, ``What if people think a guy's a hero, but he was really
 just lucky.''  Magic replies, ``Don't worry.  Sooner or later, people
 like that are exposed as the frauds they are.''  Homer is glum.

 The kids watch an Itchy and Scratchy cartoon, but only Lisa laughs.
   
   Lisa: [laughing at an Itchy and Scratchy cartoon]
         Bart, you're not laughing.  Too subtle?
   -- ``''
   
 Homer arrives and fails to hide the ham and plaque from Marge.
   
   Marge: [reading the plaque]  For heroic competence, for narrowly
          averting a meltdown, and proving without question that
          nuclear power is completely safe.  Employee of the Month!
   -- ``''
   
 Homer envisions himself listed in the dictionary under, `Fraud'.
 At the dinner table...
   
   A role model in my very own home.  How convenient!
   -- Lisa, ``''
   
   Homer: Look, I get enough admiration and respect at work!
          I don't need it here at home!
   -- No argument from Bart, ``''
   
   Marge: How are you enjoying your ham, Homey?
   Homer: Tastes so bitter, it's like ashes in my mouth...
   Marge: Hm.  It's actually more of a honey glaze.
   Lisa:  Maybe you ate a clove.
   -- Marge and Lisa uncharacteristically miss a metaphor, ``''
   
   Homer: [angrily] What's &lt;your&gt; problem, boy?
   Bart:  I had a fight with Milhouse.
   Homer: That four-eyes with a big nose?  You don't need friends like that.
   Lisa:  How Zen...
   -- Dinner conversation, ``''
   
 That evening, Homer watches bowling on TV, munching on salty snacks,
 as Lisa lies on her stomach on the floor and gazes admiringly...
   
   Homer: What is it?  What are you doing?
   Lisa:  Looking at you with quiet awe.
   Homer: Well, as long as it's quiet.
   -- ``''
   
 In his room, Bart looks through a photo album with pictures of Milhouse,
 and his walkie-talkie crackles.  ``Milhouse to Bart.  Milhouse
 to Bart.  Please don't hate me.  Please?''  Bart tosses it in the trash.

 [End of Act Two.  Time: 13:53]

 Homer is rewarded with a covered parking spot right next to the boss,
 but when he opens his car door, he scratches Burns' paint job.
 (``D'ah, he'll never know who did it.'')  Meanwhile, Smithers now must
 park in the main lot, and finds a spot a half mile from the plant.
   
   Burns:  Ah, Simpson, here's someone I want you to meet.
           Aristotle Amodopoulos, owner of the Shelbyville Nuclear Power
           Facility.  It seems Ari's been having terrible worker
           problems at Shelbyville.
   Ari:    They've lost their zest for work.  You must help them find their
           ine-haratu-nadzu-leri [or whatever].
   Homer:  Their ine-aratu-zoola-what?
   Ari:    Yes!
   -- Just checking, ``''
   
   We want you to give them a pep talk that turns them from a bunch of
   donut-eating goof-offs into a pack of Homer Simpsons!
   -- Burns seems to have missed the point, ``'
   
 Homer says he can't, but Burns says it's one of the responsibilities
 of being Employee of the Month.  Smithers finally arrives, breathless,
 and complains about the parking.  Burns and Ari gasp, and Burns sends
 Smithers away.  (``That one's always been a problem.'')

 At home, Bart plays Monopoly with Maggie.  He lands on Community Chest
 and looks through the deck to find a card he likes.
   
   Maggie: [playing Monopoly with Bart]
           [removes her pacifier, coughs up a hotel]
   Marge:  Bart, don't feed your sister hotels.
   Bart:   [holding up the box]  Don't worry, Mom.  There's tons of these things.
   -- ``''
   
   Marge: Why don't you go play with Milhouse?
   Bart:  I don't want to play with Milhouse.
   Marge: You mean you still haven't made up with him?
   Bart:  It's his mom.  She says I'm a bad influence.
          [takes Maggie's hand]  Come on, Maggie, let's go throw rocks at that
          hornet's nest.
   Marge: Mmm...
   -- ``''
   
 Marge pays a visit to Mrs. Van Houten.
   
   Marge: Mrs. Van Houten?  I'm Bart's mother.  We met in the emergency room
          when the boys drank paint?
   Mrs.V: I remember.
   -- ``''
   
 Mrs.V invites Marge in for tea.
   
   Marge: I know Bart can be a handful, but I also know what he's like inside.
          He's got a spark.  It's not a bad thing.  ... Of course, it makes
          him &lt;do&gt; bad things...
   Mrs.V: Well, Marge, the other day, Milhouse told me my meatloaf `sucks'.
          He must've gotten that from your little boy, because they
          certainly &lt;don't&gt; say that on TV.
   -- Of course, ``''
   
 Marge pleads Mrs.V to let them be friends.  Mrs.V looks outside to see
 Milhouse sitting by himself on a teeter-totter.  She agrees to think about
 it.

 At Moe's Tavern, Lisa is tagging along with Homer, pencil and pad at the
 ready...
   
   Barney: So next time somebody tells you carney folk are good, honest people,
           you can spit in their faces for me!
   Lisa:   I will, Mr. Gumbel, but if you'll excuse me, I'm profiling my dad
           for the school paper.  I thought it would be neat to follow him around
           for a day to see what makes him tick.
   Barney: Aw, that's sweet.  I used to follow my dad to a lot of bars, too.
           [belch]
   -- ``''
   
   Moe:  Here you go, one beer [sets it in front of Lisa].  One chocolate
         milk. [sets it in front of Homer]
   Lisa: Uh, excuse me, &lt;I&gt; had the chocolate milk.
   Moe:  Oh.
   -- They're so hard to tell apart, ``''
   
   What's the matter, Homer?  The depressing effects of alcohol usually
   don't kick in 'til closing time.
   -- Moe, ``''
   
   Lisa:  He's just a little nervous.  He has to give a speech tomorrow on
          how to keep cool in a crisis.
   Homer: [shaking Lisa in a panic]  What am I going to do!?
          What am I going to do!?
   -- You could see that gag coming, couldn't you?  ``''
   
   Barney: I had to give a speech once.  I was pretty nervous, so I used a
           little trick.  I picture everyone in their underwear.
           The judge, the jury, my lawyer, everybody.
   Homer:  Did it work?
   Barney: I'm a free man, ain't I?
   -- A mixed blessing, ``''
   
 Meanwhile, Bart is playing chess with Maggie, who is sucking on the white
 king.  The walkie-talkie crackles to life...
   
   Milhouse: [on the walkie talkie]  Milhouse to Bart.  Do you want to come
             over and play?
   Bart:     Really?  We can be friends again?  Did your mom die?
   Milhouse: Um, I don't think so.
   Bart:     Well, who cares.
   -- Would you like to check?  ``''
   
 Bart announces to Marge that he's friends with Milhouse again, and Marge
 is pleased.  He thanks her for sticking up for him.  How did he know?
 ``Who else would?''  After a brief tender moment, Marge says, ``Be good,''
 and leaves.  Bart says, ``I will,'' and pulls out from under his bed
 a ``Dead Eye BB Gun''.

 At the Shelbyville plant, Homer is introduced to a large audience.
   
   As I look out into this sea of smiling faces, I am filled with a sense of
   [suddenly turns nasty] loathing and revulsion!  You are not workers!  You
   are a pack of mangy, cud-chewing, ugly goats!
   -- Aristotle Amodopoulos gives his employees a pep talk, ``''
   
 Although
 at first nervous, he remembers Barney's suggestion.  (Barney's ghostly
 elocution here is priceless.)  He puts it into action, and it works.  That
 is, until he looks down at himself and sees that he's also in his underwear.
 He hides behind the podium and reads his speech hesitantly.
   
   Homer: [nervously reading a speech]  Grace under pressure is no...
   Voice: [sirens wail]  Three minutes to meltdown.
          [the auditorium empties in a panic]
   Homer: Phew!  Saved by the bell.
   -- Ask not for whom the bell tolls, ``''
   
 Fifteen seconds to core meltdown, Ari has brought Homer to the safety
 control room and instructs him, ``Just do what you did before.''
 Homer does exactly that, counting, ``Eenie, meenie, miney, moe.''
 He pushes the button...
   
   Crisis has been averted.  Everything is super.
   -- Computer announcement, ``''
   
 Ari is furious.  ``Do you even know what button you pushed?''
 ``Sure!  Moe!''
   
   Eenie meenie miney moe.
   Is Homer a hero?  The answer is, `No'.
   I'm Kent Brockman, and that was `My Two Cents'.
   -- A brief editorial, ``''
   
 Next is Scott Christian with ``Laugh and a Half''.  His first item is
 how Chief Wiggum foiled a hold-up without even knowing it.  He was
 counting his penny-jar at the bank, and the thief accidentally bumped
 into him, and the jar accidentally broke over his head.  Scott
 concludes, ``Yes, it seems the chief pulled a Homer Simpsons of his own.''

 Barney falls off his stool at Moe's, but finds a tasty pretzel on the
 floor.  ``Wow!  Looks like I pulled a Homer!''

 At the basketball game, Magic has the ball, but slips.  The ball flies
 out of his hands, hits the referee, and goes in the basket.  Says Magic,
 ``Looks like I pulled a Homer.''

 Lisa reads the dictionary, where the entry for Homer reads, ``To succeed
 despite idiocy.''  Says Lisa, ``Our dad.  Now he belongs to the ages.''

 EPISODE TITLE: Like Father, Like Clown


EPISODE SUMMARY: 

 On the set of the Krusty the Klown Show, Krusty concludes his axe-throwing
 act (with a hapless Sideshow Mel as the axe-ee).  He then thanks Mel,
 Corporal Punishment, Gina Ballerina, and (from Knots Landing) Miss Donna
 Mills.  He concludes with a song, and the second the cameras are off, he
 becomes depressed.  He cancels all his appointments, including his thank-you
 dinner with Bart for saving him from a robbery conviction.

 At home, Maggie sees SLH slurping water out of his water dish and decides
 to join him.  (Miss) Lois Pennycandy calls to inform Marge that Krusty has
 cancelled, for the fifth time.  ``Something really important came up at
 the last minute.''  (We see Krusty scrubbing mildew from his shower.)

 In Bart's room...
   
   Bart:     Okay, Milhouse, how many Krusty autographs should I put you
             down for?
   Milhouse: A hundred!
   Bart:     Consider it done.
   -- ``''
   
 Singing ``This Could Be the Start of Something Big'', Bart applies generous
 amounts of Krusty Kologne and comes downstairs dressed sharp, to learn that
 Krusty isn't coming.  He returns to his room and writes an angry letter.
   
   Dear Krusty:  This is Bart Simpson, Krusty Buddy #16302, respectfully
   returning his badge.  I always suspected that nothing in life mattered.
   Now I know for sure.  Get bent!  -- Bart Simpson
   -- ``''
   
 Meanwhile...
   
   Krusty: [dials 1-900-SEX-CHAT]
   Voice:  You've reached the Party Line!  In a moment, you'll be connected to
           a hot party, with some of the world's most beautiful women!  Now,
           let's join the party!
           [five-way split screen, showing five men]
   Krusty: Hello?
   Man 1:  Hello?
   Man 2:  Hello?
   Apu:    Are there any women here?
   Krusty: Hello!?
   Apu:    Are you a beautiful woman?
   Krusty: [angrily] Do I sound like a beautiful woman?
   Apu:    This is not as hot a party as I anticipated.
   -- ``''
   
 Lois comes in and shows Krusty the letter Bart sent.  (He has trouble
 reading it, of course.)  She threatens that if he doesn't go to the dinner,
 she'll quit.  Krusty gives in.  (``But I sure hate missing Schnapps Night
 at the Friar's Club.'')
   
   Marge: [gently reminding] Bart, wipe your feet.
   Bart:  Why bother?  They'll just get dirty again.
   -- A different point of view, ``''
   
 Marge tells Bart that Krusty is coming to dinner, this time for real.
   
   [a rap at the door in the `Shave and a Haircut' rhythm, with horn honks
    and Krusty's laugh in place of `Two Bits'.]
   Homer: You think it's him?
   -- Waiting for Krusty, ``''
   
 Krusty's loud entrance scares Maggie.  The doorbell rings again.  It's
 a neatly dressed Milhouse.  (``I was just in the neighborhood...'')
   
   Krusty: [entertaining the family by riding a unicycle while balancing
            a plant on his nose]
   Bart:   Krusty, you don't have to be `on' tonight.
   Homer:  What are you talking about!  Of course he does!
   Lisa:   No Dad, Krusty is our guest.  Your pratfalls and Punchinello
           antics aren't necessary here.
   Krusty: Really?
   Bart:   Yeah, just relax and be yourself.
   Krusty: Oh, that's a relief.  [gets down from unicycle, removes plant from
           nose (revealing that it was attached via suction cup), and releasing a
           chimp on roller skates]  Go wait in the car.  [the chimp skates away]
   Homer:  Aw, we could have seen the monkey!
   -- To complement the baboon, ``''
   
 At the dinner table...
   
   Marge:    Who wants to say Grace?
   Lisa:     Why don't we let our guest do it?
   Milhouse: Bless us O Lord...
   Bart:     [whaps Milhouse]
   Milhouse: Hey!  [rubs his ample nose]
   -- My Dinner with Krusty, ``''
   
 Bart invites Krusty to do so...
   
   Krusty: [saying a pre-meal blessing]
           Baruch atah adonai,
           eloheinu, melech ha'olam,
           hamotzi lechem min ha'aretz.
   Homer:  Hee hee hee hee hee!  He's talking funny-talk!
   Lisa:   No Dad, that's Hebrew!  Krusty must be Jewish.
   Homer:  A Jewish entertainer?  Get out of here!
   Lisa:   Dad, there are many prominent Jewish entertainers, including
           Lauren Bacall, Dinah Shore, William Shatner, and Mel Brooks.
   Homer:  Mel Brooks is Jewish!?!
   -- Who would've known?  ``''
   
 Krusty collapses in tears.
   
   Bart:   Krusty, are you all right?
   Krusty: Yes, it's just that saying the bracha brings back a lot of
           painful memories, the old days, my... my father... [bawls]
   Homer:  Hey, Krusty, you going to finish that meatloaf or what?
   -- ``''
   
 [End of Act One:  6:03]
   
   Poor Krusty.  He's like a black velvet painting come to life.
   -- Lisa, ``''
   
 The family invite Krusty to tell his story.
   
   My name isn't Krusty the Klown.  It's Herschel Krustofsky.  My father was
   a rabbi.  &lt;His&gt; father was a rabbi.  His father's fath---  Well, you get
   the idea.
   -- Big shoes to fill with small feet (like all good-hearted people),
      ``''
   
 Krusty flashes back to his youth.
   
   Man 1:   Should I finish college?
   Rabbi K: Yes.  No one is poor except he who lacks knowledge.
   Woman:   [babe in arms]  Rabbi, should I have another child?
   Rabbi K: Yes.  Another child would be a blessing on your house.
   Man 2:   Rabbi, should I buy a Chrysler?
   Rabbi K: Eh, couldn't you rephrase that as a, as an ethical question?
   Man 2:   Um...  Is it right to buy a Chrysler?
   Rabbi K: Oh, yes!  [chuckles]  For great is the car with power steering
            and dynaflow suspension!
   -- It is written... ``''
   
 But Hyman Krustofsky forbids his son to be a clown.  The urge was too
 great, and Herschel got his first big laughs at yeshiva, impersonating
 his father.  His father was not pleased.
   
   Homer: Boy, you don't have to follow in my footsteps.
   Bart:  Don't worry, I don't even like using the bathroom after you.
   Homer: Why you little! [strangles Bart]
   -- ``''
   
 Lisa invites Krusty to continue.  ``My father tried to extinguish the
 comedy bug, but it was no use.''  The elder Krustofsky catches the younger
 with a seltzer bottle.  (``Oy gevald!'')  Then Krusty got his big chance,
 entertaining the Rabbis at a Talmudic conference in the Catskills.  His
 balloon sculptures of a Star of David and a Menorah are met with applause.
   
   Rabbi K: You know that my son Herschel was first in his yeshiva class?
            As a matter of fact, he was voted `The most likely to hear God'.
   Rabbi 2: Oh, go on, Hyman, you're exaggerating again, you're so proud of
            your son.
   Rabbi K: A rabbi would never exaggerate!  A rabbi composes.  He creates
            thoughts.  He tells stories that may never have happened.
            But he does not exaggerate!
   -- ``''
   
 But when a ``rowdy rabbi'' sprays Krusty with seltzer, his clown make-up
 runs and he is exposed for who he really is.
   
   Oy vey's mir!  You have brought shame on our family!
   Oh, if you were a musician or a jazz singer, this I could forgive.
   -- Rabbi Krustofsky to his son the clown, ``''
   
 And he hasn't seen his father since.
   
   Bart:   Krusty, do you think about your father a lot?
   Krusty: All the time.  Except when I'm at the track.  Then it's all business.
   -- Keeping those emotions in check, ``''
   
 It's almost midnight, Lisa has fallen asleep in an armchair, and Marge
 sleepily turns off the lights, as Homer, Bart, and Milhouse drowsily
 watch Krusty leaf excitedly through a family photo album.
   
   Krusty:   So, uh, Milhouse, know any knock-knock jokes?
   Milhouse: [crying] I want to go home!
   -- The clown who came to dinner, ``''
   
 Homer take Milhouse home, as Krusty excitedly discovers, ``Wow!  The
 concert for Bangladesh!'' and pops in the videotape.  Krusty finally
 bids the family good-bye, then asks, ``Hey, did I leave my keys inside?''
 Lisa and Bart immediately yell, ``No!!''  As Krusty walks away, it starts
 to rain.  He passes a porno movie house and watches a coin-op television
 at the bus depot.
   
   Announcer:  Academy Award Playhouse now returns you to...
               Hercules vs. the Martians!
   Martian:    Welcome to our spaceship, mighty Hercules.  Hahahaha.
   -- ``''
   
 Krusty then decides to call his father.
   
   Rabbi K: [answering the phone]  Hello.  Hello?  Anybody there?
       What's this, I hear the phone ring, and suddenly there's nothing.
       I'm listening and there's no talking.  Hello, mister, who are you?
       Why would they call if they don't want to talk to you? [hangs up]
   -- ``''
   
 After an Itchy and Scratchy cartoon with a father-and-son theme...
   
   Didn't Itchy Junior look happy playing with his father?  And didn't Scratchy
   Junior look happy playing with his dad until they got run over by a thresher?
   -- Krusty asks the kids, ``''
   
 Krusty breaks down on camera.
   
   A man who envies our family is a man who needs help.
   -- Lisa Simpson on Krusty the Klown, ``''
   
 Bart and Lisa pay a visit to Reverend Lovejoy...
   
   Bart:  Reverend Lovejoy, we need you to help us find a rabbi.
   Rev.L: [flustered] Well, um, before you make any rash decisions, let me
          just remind you that the church is changing to meet the needs
          of today's young Christians!
   -- Church Chat, ``''
   
   Lisa:  We just want to find a Rabbi Krustofsky.
   Rev.L: Rabbi Krustofsky?  Well, I do a radio call-in show with him every
          Sunday night!
   Bart:  Really?
   Lisa:  I didn't know that.
   Rev.L: Gee, uh, I mention it in my sermon every week.
   Bart:  [false realization]  Oh, oh, &lt;that&gt; radio show!
   Lisa:  [playing along]  Oh yeah!  It's all the kids talk about on Monday at
          school.

 Rev. Lovejoy gives the kids a `Gabbing about God' T-shirt.

   Rev.L: Oh, sure thing.  Let me just check my non-Christian rolodex...

 The kids pay him a visit.
   
   Lisa:    Excuse us, Rabbi Krustofsky?

   Bart:    We came to talk to you about your son.
   Rabbi K: I have no son!  [slams the door]

 Krustofsky.
   
   Announcer: And our first caller is from Shelbyville Heights.
   Caller:    Yes, hi.  With all the suffering and injustice in the world,
              do you ever wonder if God really exists?

   Rabbi K:   Not at all.

 The next call is for Rabbi Krustofsky.

            What's going on here?  Hello, mister?  Hello, hello?
   Krusty:  [sighs, hangs up]
   Rabbi K: Some people got nothing to do but call people and hang up.
            There's all kinds of mishegoyim in the world.
   -- Gabbing about God, ``''
   
 The next caller is Bart.
   
   Bart:      Hello, my name's Dmitri.  I'm a first-time caller, long-time
              listener.  My question is, if a son defies his father and chooses
              a career that makes millions of children happy, shouldn't the
              father forgive the son?
   Rev. L:    I think so.
   Msgr. D:   Yes, of course.
   Rabbi K:   No way!  Absolutely not!  Never, never!  Who screens these calls?
              Who's in charge here?  There's nobody in charge?  They leave
              a building without people watching it, and anybody who wants can...
   -- Gabbing about God, ``''
   
 Bart puts into action ``a plan that can't fail''.  He goes to Yiddle's
 and gets a fake beard, moustache, and eyebrows.  In the park, Rabbi
 Krustofsky is engaged in a discussion, and Bart pokes his head in,
 suggesting he forgive his son.  Rabbi Krustofsky tells him, ``Get out of
 here, you little pisher.''  At home...
   
   Bart: Oy!  This guy's tough.
   Lisa: Bart, we're going to have to outsmart him.
   Bart: I dunno, he's pretty sharp.  He saw right through this disguise.

 Lisa hands Bart a slip of paper, and
 Bart quotes the Babylonian Talmud, but the rabbi counters with the
 fifth commandment.  Back at the library, Lisa has come up with
 ``some dynamite stuff from Rabbi Simon ben Eliezer.''  She and Bart
 exchange high-fives.  Bart visits Rabbi Krustofsky in the sauna...
   
   Bart:    At all times, let a man be supple as a reed and not rigid
            as a cedar.

   Rabbi K: But, my short learned friend, the book of Joshua says, ``You

   Man:     All night?

 Lisa has fallen asleep at the library, and Bart finds a slip of
 paper tucked under her arm.  He visits the rabbi once again, this
 time, while he's performing a bris.  One last visit to the library...
   
   Lisa: [tired]  Here you go, Bart.  It's a longshot, but that's all
         I can do without learning ancient Hebrew.
   Bart: [stares at her]
   Lisa: Bart!  I am &lt;not&gt; going to learn ancient Hebrew!!
   -- But you already know pig Latin, how much different can it be?

 In the park, as Bart and Rabbi Krustofsky play chess, Bart plays
 his final card, and the rabbi is impressed.  The quote is by
 Sammy Davis, Jr., an entertainer.  (``The Candy Man?'')  The rabbi
 is won over.

 Krusty does his show without enthusiasm.  While an I&amp;S cartoon runs,
 Krusty relaxes with a cigarette, and his father comes in.  The two
 are reunited, and Krusty makes the tender announcement on his show,
 and he and his father sing a song together.
   
   Moe:    [moved to tears]  I got something in my eye...
   Barney: Here, take my hankie.
   Moe:    [sees Barney's filthy handkerchief]  Agh!
   -- It's the thought that counts, ``''
   
 At the conclusion of the song, Bart hands Rabbi Krustofsky a cream pie,
 and he throws it in Krusty's face.  (No longer just for noshing.)
 They embrace, and there are laughs all around.

EPISODE SUMMARY: 

 NOTE:  The quotes aren't really all that funny when taken out of context,
 so you might want to be selective about which you include in your
 fortune cookie program.

 Marge comes out on stage and issues her disclaimer.
   
   Ahem.  Hello, everyone.  Before last year's Hallowe'en show, I warned you
   not to let your children watch.  But you did anyway.  Mm.  Well, this
   year's episode is even worse.  It's scarier, more violent, and I think
   they snuck in some bad language, too.  So please, tuck in your children
   and... [sighs]  Well, if you didn't listen to me last time, you're not
   going to now.  Enjoy the show.

 pan over Springfield Cemetary.

   Presidential primaries are only a few months away.  [chuckles]

 Kerny and Dolph ring the bell.  ``Trick or treat, man.''  They aren't
 costumed, but threaten to egg the house if Homer doesn't pay up.
 Homer hands them candy, but they egg the house anyway.

 Marge and the kids return from trick-or-treating.  Bart is a hooded
 executioner, Maggie a witch, Lisa a totem pole (in honor of the noble
 native Americans of the Pacific Northwest), and Marge the Bride of
 Frankenstein (what else could she possibly be?).  Marge tells the kids
 they can have one piece of candy before bed, but before she finishes
 her sentence, everybody (including Homer and Maggie) has begun gorging
 themselves on candy.
   
   Marge: If you eat too much, you'll have nightmares.
   Bart:  [mouth full of candy]  [sarcasm] Oh yeah, everybody in the family
          is going to have bad nightmares tonight, ha!
   Lisa:  [more sarcasm] Oh yeah, three bad nightmares.
   Homer: [yet more sarcasm]  I'd like to see that!  Heh heh heh!

 Lisa eats a candy bar in bed, then turns off the light.  (Her bedcovers
 are still strewn with candy wrappers.)

 The place:  Marrakesh, Morocco.

   Lisa:  [annoyed]  Dad, that's Monaco.
   -- A visit to Morocco, `The Monkey's Paw' in ``''
   
 They watch a contortionist do his thing.  (Says Bart, ``I can do that,
 but I don't want to.'')  At a market, Homer inquires after a monkey's
 paw, which the vendor claims will grant wishes to its owner.
   
   Vendor: Sir, I must strongly advise you:  Do not purchase this.
           Behind every wish lurks grave misfortune.
           I, myself, was once president of Algeria.
   Homer:  Come on, pal, I don't want to hear your life story.  Paw me!
   -- A visit to Morocco, `The Monkey's Paw' in ``''
   
 Marge is not pleased by Homer's purchase.
   
   Marge: Ew, Homer, where did you get that ugly thing?
   Homer: Why, at that little shop right over... there?
          [all that's left is a gust of wind]  [gasp!]
          Oh, no, wait, it was over there.
          [points at the shop]

 Boarding the plane, Homer is caught by customs.  He is fined $2.

 At home, the paw sits on the coffee table.  Bart wants to wish for
 X-Ray specs that really work.  Lisa would rather wish for peace on
 earth.  While they're arguing, Maggie grabs the paw and makes her wish.
 A limo pulls up outside, and Homer is pleased.  (``Good baby!'')  The
 driver brings Maggie a shiny new pacifier, then speeds off. (``D'oh!'')

 Bart decides he's waited long enough and wishes for the Simpsons to be
 rich and famous.  (``Now, you're talking!'' agrees Homer.)  Immediately,
 they are showered with money.  Homer takes the family to the fanciest
 restaurant in town, the Gilded Truffle.  The maitre d' shows them to
 their table...
   
   Marge:   Homer, maybe fame and fortune aren't as bad as they say.
   Woman 1: If I hear one more thing about the Simpsons, I swear, I'm going
            to scream.
   Woman 2: At first they were cute and funny, but now they are just annoying.

 The sentiment is echoed around town as Our Favorite Family becomes heavily
 merchandised.  In the living room...

   would bring grave misfortune.  I thought he was just being colorful.

 The townsfolk blame it all on the Simpsons.

 Back in the living room, Homer decides to wish for something completely
 harmless.
   
   I'll make a wish that can't backfire.  I wish for a turkey sandwich, on
   rye bread, with lettuce and mustard, and, &lt;and&gt; I don't want any zombie
   turkeys, I don't want to turn into a turkey myself, and I don't want any
   other weird surprises.  You got it?

   Not bad.  Nice, hot mustard.  Good bread.  The turkey's a little dry.

 Ned sees Moe being chased by an alien.  (``Kneel before my slingshot,

 chases the alien with a board with a nail in it.  The aliens flee.
   
   Alien 1: It seems the earthlings won.
   Alien 2: Did they?  That board with a nail in it may have defeated us.
            But the humans won't stop there.  They'll make bigger boards
            and bigger nails, and soon, they will make a board with a nail
            so big, it will destroy them all!

 The townfolk carries Ned on their shoulders.  He goes into his house,
 which transforms into a majestic castle, dwarfing the Simpsons' residence.
 Grumbles Homer, ``I wish &lt;I&gt; had a monkey's paw...''

 [End of Act One.  Time: 8:40]

 Lisa wakes Bart and asks if she can sleep in his bed.  She pays him with
 candy necklace, which Bart ingests in five seconds.  (``Climb aboard.'')
 Bart drifts off to dream-land...
   
   Presented for your consideration:  Springfield.  An average little town,
   with a not-so-average monster.
   [townsfolk wander around with nervous smiles, saying, `Happy happy!']
   The people of Springfield have to make sure they think happy thoughts
   and say happy things.  Because this particular monster can read minds,
   and if displeased, can turn people into grotesque walking terrors.
   -- Welcome to... `The Bart Zone' in ``''
   
 Jasper grumbles, ``Happy thoughts.  Happy thoughts.  Boy, I'm getting
 mighty sick of this.''  His body promptly turns into that of a dog.

 Bart comes down to breakfast, where the family spit out their mouthfuls
 and force smiles all around.  (Even Maggie smiles through her pacifier.)
 They're all sickeningly (and nervously) nice to Bart.

 Bart gets on the school bus and decides he's going to drive it.
 The bus careens down the road with Bart at the wheel, as the kids
 on the bus scream in panic.  Otto is on the floor manning the pedals.
 (``Quit riding the brake, Otto.  Give it some gas, man!'')  The
 bus whizzes past the two cops, who say, ``Hiya, Bart!''

 At school, we see an overturned school bus `parked' in front.  Inside...
   
   Well, class the history of our country has been changed again, to correspond
   with Bart's answers on yesterday's test.  [groans from the class]

 Homer is watching the football game, and a field goal attempt is in
 progress.  Bart wants to watch Krusty.  When Homer refuses, Bart
 furrows his brow, and poof! Homer disappears.
   
   The kick is up!  It's looking good!  The ball is turning into a fat bald

 Homer arrives home, his head bandaged.  He grabs a chair and is about to
 bash Bart's head in, when he suddenly turns into a jack-in-the-box.
 Marge comes in, and Bart says, ``Lisa did it.''  Marge says, ``That's it!
 You're coming with me! ... [big smile] Please?''  Bart is taken to see
 Dr. Marvin Monroe, who suggests that Bart just needs to get more attention
 from his father.  So Homer (still a jack-in-the-box) takes Bart to the
 ballgame, goes fishing with him, watches him shoot a BB gun, and takes him
 on a roller coaster ride.  Homer then tries to tuck Bart in (though it's
 hard since he's still a jack-in-the-box).  Bart appreciates the past few
 days and wishes there were some way he could repay Homer.  Homer asks for
 his body back, and Bart returns it.  ``I love you, Dad.'' Homer responds,
 ``I love you, son.''

 Bart wakes from his nightmare, screaming.

 [End of Act Two.  Time: 14:51]

 Bart and Lisa rush into Homer and Marge's bed...

 Burns and Smithers review the security monitors and see Homer sleeping

 suggests they fire one of them, and Burns selects Homer.

 Burns and Smithers pull an oil lamp, and they vanish behind the

 With a bum reed, Lisa's playing is hardly acceptable.  (``Sounds like that
 gopher I caught in me lawn mower,'' complains Groundskeeper Willy.)  Homer
 hears Lisa's playing and notes, ``I'd hate to be that kid's father.''  Then
 he sees who the kid in question is.  Principal Skinner cuts Lisa's
 performance short, and only Homer applauds.  Lisa cries.

 At the ice cream shop, Homer buys Lisa a HUMONGOUS sundae, but Lisa hardly
 touches it.

 Baby Lisa teeters in front of the TV set, where Homer picks her up
 and moves her out of the way.
   
   Lisa:  [as a baby, in her high chair]  Dada?  Dada?
   Marge: [o.s.]  Did you hear that, Homer?

 Homer realizes that Lisa hates her because he never paid attention to her.
 Marge suggests he just spend some time with her.  Homer plays tea with
 Lisa, as Bart and Milhouse mock them from the next room.  Homer leaps
 from his chair (overturning Lisa's little tea table in the process) to
 go after Bart.  Homer tries to blow-dry Lisa's hair.  Homer pushes Lisa
 on a swing, but pushes too hard, and she goes flying off.
   
   Maybe I should just cut my losses, give up on Lisa, and make a fresh start
   with Maggie.
   -- Homer, ``''
   
   Marge: Homey, you've got to stop looking for the quick fix.  If you keep
          spending time with Lisa, she'll forgive you.
   Homer: Marge, if I spend any more time doing these girl things, I'm going to,
          you know, go fruity.  No, you were right the first time with that
          quick fix idea.

 Marge tries to be realistic; a pony is very expensive.

          it costs.
   Lady:  Very good.  That stunning creature over there is half
          a million dollars.

 EPISODE TITLE: Burns Verkaufen der Kraftwerk


EPISODE SUMMARY: 

 Smithers washes the hair of Monty Burns, whose spirits are down.  Burns
 isn't very forthcoming, so Smithers pulls out Snappy the Alligator, a hand
 puppet.  Burns complains that running the plant is preventing him from
 fulfilling his other wishes and is considers selling it.  Smithers gasps.

 Homer tries to feed a tattered dollar bill into the vending machine,
 with no success.  He cries, complaining, ``It's not fair.''  Smithers
 consoles him, thinking about Burns.  ``I bet he wouldn't sell the plant
 for $100 million.''  Homer asks Smithers for change for a dollar.

 At work, Homer takes a call from his stockbroker.
   
   Broker: Your stock in the power plant just went up for the first time
           in ten years.
   Homer:  I own stock?
   Broker: Yes, all the employees got some in exchange for waiving certain
           Constitutional rights.
   -- A fair exchange, ``''
   
 Before the broker can talk business, ``The book says we have to make a
 little small talk before we get down to business.''  After some
 tremendously superficial conversation, the broker tells Homer his stock
 is now 25c a share, giving him $25.  Homer eagerly tells the broker to
 sell, then dreams of how he could spend the money...  Getting a haircut...
 Getting the car hot-waxed...  Buying a $25 hammer...

 Marge interrupts Bart's viewing of another Itchy and Scratchy cartoon
 to switch the channel to the financial channel.  Fueled by unconfirmed
 takeover rumors, stock in Burns Worldwide has reached a high of $52.25,
 closing at $52, making the Simpsons' stock holdings worth $5200.
 Bart dreams of how he could spend the money...  Driving a car named
 Bad Boy Bart...  Having a cement truck of Frosty Chocolate Milkshakes
 poured into his mouth...  Wearing a personal rocket and skywriting
 the message, ``Eat my shorts''...

 Homer decides to celebrate his good fortune by ordering a bottle of
 Henry K. Duff's Private Reserves at Moe's.
   
   For your information, I just made a cool $25 playing the market.
   Buy low, sell high, that's my motto.
   I may just quit my job at the power plant and become a full-time
   stock... market guy.
   -- Homer makes a killing on the stock market, ``''
   
 Homer spots two German businessmen, who politely complain that American
 beer sucks.
   
   Homer: Hey, you guys aren't from around here, are you?
   Man 1: Ach, nein.  We are from Chermany.  He is from ze East.
          I am from ze Vest.
   Man 2: I hat a big company, and he hat a big company, and now we
          have a very big company.
   Man 1: We are interested in buying the power plant.
          Do you think the owner will ever sell it?
   Homer: Well, I happen to know that he won't sell it for less than
          $100 million!
   Man 2: 100 million?
   Man 1: [opens a briefcase of cash, counts]  Eins, zwei, drei, vier, fuenf...
          Oh, don't vorry, we still enough left to buy the Cleveland Browns.
   -- Buy one, get one free, ``''
   
 Marge watches the financial news with the kids and her sisters.
 Patty surmises, ``Homer is probably buying some magic beans with it
 right now.''
   
   We'll have a savings account!  We've never had one.
   -- Marge decides what to do with a stock market windfall,
      ``''
   
 Homer returns home, and Marge learns he spent the money on beer.
 ``You spent $5200 on beer?''  Homer doesn't know what Marge is
 talking about until he sees the report on TV.  Homer is on all fours
 in front of the TV, bawling.  Bart kicks him in the butt.
 ``Come on, everybody, it makes you feel better.''

 At the plant, Homer's coworkers arrive at work in shiny new cars,
 purchased with the money from the sale of their stocks.  Lenny
 paid a visit to the plastic surgeon, his face pulled so tight
 he has no choice but to smile.  One of the other workers calls the
 gang over to watch Burns on TV in his limo.  Burns is on his way
 into ``The Hungry Hun'', denying rumors that he's going to sell it
 to a German consortium.  ``You'll see the Statue of Liberty wearing
 Lederhosen before you see Germans running my plant!''  He's just
 meeting them so he can enjoy turning them down.

 Inside, Burns chats in German and tells them he's not selling.  But
 he changes his mind when they offer $100 million.
   
   Man 1: [hands Burns an offer of $100,000,000]
   Burns: Woo hoo!  [dances about a bit]  Ahem.  I grudgingly accept.
   -- Driving a hard bargain, ``''
   
 At an outdoor ceremony, Burns introduces the new owners.
 Diamond Joe Quimby adds, ``Ich bin ein Springfielder!''
 The plant workers fear their jobs, even Lenny (though you can't
 tell through his clenched teeth).  A German flag is raised over
 the plant...

 [End of Act One.  Time: 7:31]

 The workers are gathered for an informal meeting...
 (Lenny's face is back to normal.)
   
   Len:   Those lousy Germans can't fire me.  I'm the only one knows how to
          unjam the rod bottom dissociator.
   Karl:  Well, they can't fire me.  I'm the only one certified to run the
          gaseous contaminant particular [sic] fire.
   Homer: Well, they can't fire me!
   Len and Karl: Why?
   Homer: Because... [long silence]
   -- Reason enough, ``''
   
   Horst: Guten Morgen.  I am Horst.  The new owners have elected me to speak
          with you because I am the most non-threatening.  Perhaps I remind you
          of the loveable Sergeant Schultz on Hogan's Heroes.
   All:   Oh yeah, yeah he does.
   -- Familiarity breeds familiarity, ``''
   
 He explains that the best way to an efficient plant is to have happy workers
 who are secure at their jobs.
   
   Horst: Do we have any alcoholics among us?
          [hands slowly go up]
   Man 1: Uh, me?
   Man 2: Right here.
   Man 3: I'm drunk right now!
   -- Getting to know you, ``''
   
   Horst: You will be given a six-week treatment at our drying-out facility
          in Hawaii, after which you will return at full pay.
   Len:   Oh, great!  [general agreement from other employees]
   Man 1: Hey, maybe I'll marry Elizabeth Taylor!
   -- ``''
   
 Homer grumbles, ``Lucky drunks!''  Horst continues, ``We cannot ueber-
 emphasize the importance of employee safety.''  He spots a pan collecting
 green, glowing water dripping from the ceiling.
   
   Horst: We plan to have some frank discussions with your safety inspector.
   Homer: Hee hee.  Yeah.  Sock it to him, Horst!
   Len:   Psst, Homer.  Aren't &lt;you&gt; the safety inspector?
   Homer: [sees his nametag, ``SAFETY INSPECTOR'']  D'oh!
   -- ``''
   
 In his office, Burns endorses the oversized novelty check.  (``For
 deposit only.'')  Meanwhile, Smithers studies from ``Sycophantic
 German'' cassettes...
   
   ``You look sharp today, sir.''
   ``You looken sharpen todayen, mein Herr.''
   -- Smithers studies Sycophantic German, ``''
   
 Burns calls Smithers into his office.  He leaves him a photo of him
 with Elvis, though he admits that he didn't understand a word Elvis
 was saying.  His attempt to reproduce Elvis's drawl craks Smithers up.
 On Burns' agenda is to get a new hip, then beekeeping, boxing, bocce ball...
 He grabs a cane, tips his hat, and heads out.

 Homer comes into Lisa's room, where she is studying.  (Duh.)
   
   Homer: Lisa, your father needs your help.  Do you know anything about Germany?
   Lisa:  Well, it's a country in Europe.
   Homer: Good, good, I'm learning.
   -- Teaching an old dog, ``''
   
 It's also a leading economic power, because they're efficient, punctual,
 and have a strong work ethic.

 In the master bedroom, Homer whines that his job is history.  Marge
 assures him they'll find a way to pay the bills somehow.
   
   Marge, it's not the money.  My job is my identity.
   If I'm not a safety whatchamajigger, I'm nothing!
   -- Homer fears the loss of his job, ``''
   
 Marge suggests that Homer do something constructive, since he can't sleep.
 Homer plops a 5000-piece Battlestar Galactica jigsaw puzzle on the kitchen
 table, takes two pieces which obviously don't fit, and tries to force them
 together.  He dozes off, and Bart wakes him the next morning.  Homer's
 droopy visage blends into a donut-eating visage by the coffee pot.  He
 spots Horst coming and quickly changes his demeanor.
   
   Hey you, stop being... so unsafe!  Smitty!  Safen up!
   -- Homer tries to look busy, ``''
   
   Horst: Homer, could ve have a word with you?
   Homer: No.
   Horst: I must have phrased that badly.
          My English is, how you say, inelegant.
          I meant to say, may we have a brief friendly chat.
   Homer: No.
   Horst: Once again, I have failed.  [consults phrasebook]
          We request the pleasure of your company for a free exchange
          of ideas.
   Homer: [runs away in panic]
   -- Homer fears for his job, ``''
   
 Homer is in the owner's office...
   
   Man 1: You have been safety inspector for two years.
          What initiatives have you spearheaded in that time?
   Homer: Uh... All of them?
   Man 1: I see. ... Then you must have some good ideas for the future as well?
   Homer: I sure do!
   Man 1: [waits for a follow-up, which doesn't come]
   -- Homer tries to justify his job, ``''
   
 Homer mentions fixing the candy machine, since some workers really like
 their candy.  The owner says, ``We understand, Homer.  After all, we are
 from the land of chocolate!''  Homer muses, ``Mmm... The land of
 chocolate...'' and slips into a dream that, as usual, defies description.
 He is called back to reality.  ``Oh, I'm sorry.  We were talking about
 chocolate?'' ``That was ten minutes ago!''

 Homer tells Karl and Len he thinks he did okay.
   
   Karl: Yeah, you know, those Germans aren't so bad.
   Len:  Sure they made mistakes in the past, but aah, that's why pencils have
         erasers!
   -- The power plant is under new management, ``''
   
 A message comes over the PA system.

   That is all.
   -- The power plant is under new management, ``''
   
 [End of Act Two.  Time: 13:07]

 At home, Bart feeds the cat, and Marge comes in with a strange hairdo.
 ``Lisa did a &lt;wonderful&gt; job on my hair, and we saved $40.''  Marge
 tells the kids they have to pull together until Homer gets a new job.
   
   Lisa:  I made a new bar of soap by squeezing all our little soap
          slivers together!  [holds up a multi-colored ball of soap slivers]
   Marge: That's very clever.
   Bart:  And today, instead of buying comic books, I just read 'em and
          left 'em in the store.
   Marge: Mmm... You shouldn't do that.
   Lisa:  My jumprope broke, but I just tied it back together.
   Marge: That's good, Lisa.
   Bart:  I didn't take a bath today, and I may not take one tomorrow.
   Marge: I want you to take baths, Bart.
   -- The family try to scrape by, ``''
   
 Homer grumbles, ``Who are they to say I'm not safe?'' as he tries to
 fish toast out of a toaster with a knife.  He looks over to the wall
 outlet, which is a multiple-octopus mess.  ``No problem here.''

 At the park, Jasper, Abe, and a third man watch Burns feebly toss
 a bocce ball.  They laugh, and Burns tells them to get out of his park.
 Abe laughs, ``It was worth it.''

 Smithers is on the phone with Burns, complaining about what they did
 to Burns' office.  (It's now a day-care center.)  Burns tells Smithers
 he called at a bad time, but suggests they get together for a drink
 later.  Burns then hangs up, and we see that he's in a boxing ring.
 ``You're going down, my friend.'' ``Yes, sir, Mr. Burns.''

 The new owners see icky glop seeping out of cracks in the cooling tower
 and find raccoons in the consoles.

 Burns is playing beekeeper...
   
   That's right.  Gather the nectar, my little drones.  And make the honey.
   Honey for your children...
   Fools!  [laughs evilly]
   -- Burns watches his bee colony, ``''
   
 Smithers stops by, and Burns introduces his bees, including the queen,
 which he named Smithers.

 At Moe's Tavern, the phone rings.
   
   Moe:  Moe's Tavern, Moe speaking.
   Bart: Uh, yes, I'm looking for a Mrs. O'Problem?  First name, Bea.
   Moe:  Uh, yeah, just a minute, I'll check.
         [calls]  Uh, Bea O'Problem?  Bea O'Problem!
         Come on guys, do I have a Bea O'Problem here?
   Barney: You sure do!  [bar denizens laugh]
   Moe:  Oh... [to phone]  It's you, isn't it!
   Bart: [laughs]
   Moe:  Listen, you.  When I get a hold of you, I'm going to use your head
         for a bucket and paint my house with your brains!
   -- ``''
   
 Marge sends Bart to Moe's to get Homer.  Bart gulps hard.

 Bart comes into Moe's and asks a random gentleman, ``Excuse me, I'm
 looking for...''  Moe interrupts.  ``Wait a minute...  I know that
 voice.''  Bart expects the worst.  Moe continues brightly, ``If it
 isn't little Bart Simpson!  I haven't seen you in years!''  Moe asks
 Bart to sing that song he used to sing, and Bart does so.  Burns and
 Smithers stop in to find Bart singing and dancing on the counter, and
 the bar denizens eating it up.  (Moe rewards Bart with a Krusty Bar.)
 Trying to fit in, Burns orders a beer for Homer, but Homer snaps at him.
   
   Burns:    Smithers, who is this saucy fellow?
   Smithers: Homer Simpson, sir.  Sector sieben-Grueber, I mean, sector 7-G.
   -- ``''
   
 Homer, the rest of the gang, and even Bart mock and abuse Burns.
   
   What good is money if it can't inspire terror in your fellow man?
   -- Burns learns the moral of the story, ``''
   
 At the plant, the ceiling collapses, and the repairs to bring it up to
 code will cost $100 million.  Burns pays the owners a visit...
   
   Burns: [begging] Please sell me my plant back.  I'll pay anything.
   Horst: Isn't this a happy coincidence!  You are desperate to buy, and we
          are desperate to sell.
   Burns: [calculatingly]  Desperate, eh? ... Advantage: Burns!
   -- Reversal of fortune, ``''
   
 Burns plays hardball, managing to repurchase the plant for only $50 million.
 The Germans reluctantly agree...
   
   Horst: [threatingly] We Germans aren't all smiles und sunshine.
   Burns: [recoils in mock horror]
          Oooh, the Germans are mad at me.  I'm so scared!  Oooh, the Germans!
          [hiding behind Smithers]  Uh oh, the Germans are going to get me!
   Horst: Stop it!
   Man 2: Stop, sir.
   Burns: Don't let the Germans come after me.
          Oh no, the Germans are coming after me.
   Man 2: Please stop the `pretending you are scared' game, please.
   Horst: Stop it!  Stop it!
   Burns: [brief pause, then resumes]
          No!  They're so big and strong!
   Man 2: Stop it.
   Horst: Stop it, Mr. Burns.
   Man 2: Please stop pretending you are scared of us, please, now.
   Burns: Oh, protect me from the Germans!  The Germans...
   Horst: Burns, STOP IT!
   -- ``''
   
 Burns throws the kids out of his office and orders Smithers to ``restore
 my office, cancel all repairs, and rehire that chap who sassed me in the
 bar.''  Why?  ``I keep my friends close, and my enemies closer. ... One
 day, when he least expects it...''  Burns stabs a doll on his desk.

 Homer gets off the phone.  ``Woo hoo!  I got my job back!''

 EPISODE TITLE: I Married Marge


EPISODE SUMMARY: 

 In the kitchen, Marge studies the instructions on a home pregnancy test.
   
   Marge: Barnacle Bill's Home Pregnancy Test?  Homer, shouldn't we have gone
          with a better-known brand?
   Homer: But Marge, this one came with a corn-cob pipe!
   -- And smoke it, ``''
   
   Ahoy, Maties!
   If the water turns blue, a baby for you!
   If purple ye see, no baby thar be!
   If ye test should fail, to a doctor set sail!
   -- Barnacle Bill's Home Pregnancy Test, ``''
   
 It's pink.
   
   Homer: Do you really think you're pregnant?
   Marge: Well, I have the same nausea and craving for pancake mix I had with
          the other kids.
   Homer: Yeah, and I have the same tightness in my chest and profuse sweating
          I always did.
   -- Simple Simpsons symptoms, ``''
   
 Marge leaves to see Dr. Hibbert.
   
   Bart:  Hey, Homer, how come Mom's going to the doctor?
   Lisa:  Is anything wrong?
   Homer: No, everything's fine.  Your mother uh just... broke her leg.
   Lisa:  What!?
   Bart:  I smell a bun in the oven...
   Lisa:  Is Mom going to have another baby, Dad?
   Homer: [fierce internal struggle manifests itself in wiggling fingers]
          Maybe.
   Bart+Lisa: Whoa, awright!  Way to go!  [exchange high fives]
   Bart:  You're a machine, Homer!
   -- Cheer and cheer alike, ``''
   
   Lisa: Did you hear that, Maggie?  Another baby in the house.
   Bart: Oh, cool!  We can race 'em!
   -- Marge might be pregnant, ``''
   
   Homer: Yeah, sure, for you, a baby's all fun and games.
          For me, it's diaper changes and midnight feedings.
   Lisa:  Doesn't Mom do that stuff?
   Homer: Yeah, but I have to hear about it.
   -- The duties of fatherhood, ``''
   
 Bart asks what it was like when Marge was pregnant with him, and Homer
 decides to tell them a story.
   
   It all happened at the beginning of that turbulent decade known as the '80's.
   Those were idealistic days...  The candidacy of John Anderson, the rise of
   Supertramp, it was an exciting time to be young...
   -- Homer tells a story, ``''
   
 Homer had been dating Marge for several years and working at the miniature
 golf course.  Homer's job is to sit inside the windmill and crank the
 blades.  His boss stops by to tell him to slow it down; the golfers are
 complaining.  Homer slackens the pace.
   
   Boss:  Keep this up, and someday &lt;you&gt; will be the guy who hands out
          the putters!
   Homer: Yes, sir!
   -- A young Homer works at the Merrie Olde Fun Centre, ``''
   
 ``I was 24 years old, with a beautiful girlfriend, &lt;and&gt; a job with a
 future,'' notes Homer.  He looks around to find that the kids have vanished.
 Bart and Lisa are playing croquet in the yard.  They thought the story
 was over.
   
   Lisa:  It's not our fault our generation has short attention spans, Dad.
          We watch an appalling amount of TV.
   Homer: Don't you ever, EVER talk that way about television.
   -- ``''
   
 Homer spots Maggie scurrying away and turns her into a captive audience.
 (We get a wild zoom of Maggie as she swings onto Homer's lap.)

 After Mrs. Bouvier takes a family picture, we hear a car horn outside.
 Marge leaves to go out with Homer, but not before her sisters express
 their scorn for ``that ugly meatball.''
   
   Patty:  If you like being pawed by something fat and lazy, we could get a cat!
   Granma: It would leave less hair on the couch.
   -- Marge's sister and mother give some alternatives to Homer,
      ``''
   
 Marge tries to stand up for
 Homer, but her point is undermined when Homer yells, ``Get your butt
 out here!''

 While waiting in line to see `The Empire Strikes Back', Marge asks Homer
 what his plans for the future are.
   
   Marge: I can't imagine that job of yours is very stimulating.
   Homer: But it gives me time to think.
   Marge: Oh.  What do you think about?
   Homer: Oh, girls.  I mean, boys.  I, I mean, you.
   -- Planning for the future, ``''
   
 Coming out of the movie...
   
   Homer: Wow, what an ending!  Who would have thought Darth Vader was
          Luke Skywalker's father!
   Crowd: [waiting in line to see the movie]  Oh, thank you, Mister
          Blow-the-picture-for-me.  [etc]
   -- The infamous Ctrl-L, ``''
   
 In Homer's car (complete with `DISCO SUCKS' bumper sticker), they sing
 `You Light Up My Life' along with the radio, though Homer has trouble
 with the words.
   
   Marge: [listening to `You Light Up My Life' on the radio]  Our song.
   Homer: I bet the guy she was singing that about was real happy.
   Marge: Well, actually, she was singing about God.
   Homer: Oh, well, He's always happy.  No, wait, He's always mad...
   -- Look, do you want a happy God or a vengeful God?  ``''
   
 Marge and Homer are inside a miniature castle at the golf course.
   
   Homer: Someday, I'll buy you a &lt;real&gt; castle.
   Marge: You don't have to do that.
   Homer: Phew.  Good.
   -- ``''
   
   Marge: Maybe it's the champale talking, but I think you're pretty sexy.
   Homer: Really?  It &lt;must&gt; be the champale talking.
   -- ``''
   
 They make out.  Marge asks, ``What if we get caught?''  Homer explains,
 ``Don't worry, this castle is impregnable.''  At that moment, a golfer
 putts the ball into a ``Free Game'' hole, and lights flash and bells
 ring.

 Homer watches `Charlie's Angels' with Barney (``Pass the cookie dough.'')
 and celebrates when they're sent on a mission to Hawaii.  He gets a
 phone call from Marge (working as a roller-skated carhop at Bergers
 Burgers) asking to be taken to the doctor.

 Dr. Hibbert breaks the news.
   
   Dr.H:  Well, uh, Miss Bouvier,
          I think we've found the reason why you've been
          throwing up in the morning.
          Congratulations.
   Homer: D'oh!
   -- The price of passion, ``''
   
 Homer's ``D'oh'' echoes through the hospital.
   
   Dr.H:  Perhaps this pamphlet will prove helpful. [hands over a pamphlet]
   Marge: [reads] So you've ruined your life.
   -- Marge learns she's pregnant, ``''
   
 At home, Homer talks to Abe.
   
   Grampa: Son, you've got to marry that girl!
   Homer:  Because it's the honorable thing to do?
   Grampa: [slams his hand on the table] No, because you'll never do any better.
           Ha ha, you lucky bum!  The fish jumped right in the boat, and
           all you gotta do is whack her with the oar!
   -- Marge becomes pregnant, ``''
   
 Parked at Inspiration Point...
   
   Marge, there's something I want to ask you.  But I'm afraid, because if
   you say no, it'll destroy me and make me a criminal.
   -- Homer tries to work up the nerve to propose to Marge, ``''
   
 ``Well, I haven't said `no' to you lately, have I?'' replies Marge.
 [Obviously not.]  Homer tries to find the index card on which he
 wrote down what he was going to say, and Marge finds it and reads it.
 ``Marge, from the first moment I saw you, I never wanted to be with
 anyone else.  I don't have much to offer you except all my love.
 Will you marry me?''  ``That's the card.  Give it here,'' says Homer.
 Marge accepts the proposal, and Homer celebrates.  (``In your face,
 everybody!'')

 [End of Act One.  Time: 7:19]

 The kids are listening to the story.
   
   Lisa: Dad, if the new baby is a girl, can we name her Ariel?
   Bart: Bzzzzt.  I'm sorry, the baby's name will be Cool Mo-Dee Simpson.
   Lisa: Ariel!              Ariel!              Ariel!
   Bart:        Cool Mo-Dee!        Cool Mo-Dee!        Cool Mo-Dee!
   -- The kids learn that Marge might be pregnant, ``''
   
 Homer recalls the discussions he and Marge had about naming their child.
 (The kids dash off in a puff of smoke.)

 At the Family Jewels store, Homer and Marge survey the choice of rings.
   
   Marge: Homer, I've been thinking, if the baby's a boy, what do you think
          of the name Larry?
   Homer: Marge, we can't do that!  All the kids will call him `Larry Fairy'.
   Marge: Well, how about Louie?
   Homer: They'll call him `Screwy Louie'.
   Marge: Bob?
   Homer: `Flob'. [?]
   Marge: Luke?
   Homer: `Puke'.
   Marge: Marcus?
   Homer: `Mucus'.
   Marge: What about Bart?
   Homer: Let's see...  Bart, Cart, Dart, Ee-art...  Nope, can't see any problem
          with that!
   -- Stopped in the nick of time, ``''
   
   Homer: [spots a nice ring]  Wow.  I'll take &lt;that&gt; ring.
   Clerk: Yes, sir, and how will you be paying for it?
   Homer: I don't know.
   -- Good things come to those who wait, ``''
   
 Homer and Marge drive to `Shotgun Pete's' just past the state line.
   
   Basic ceremony's twenty bucks.  Here's your license.
   Be sure to get this punched every time.  The tenth wedding is on the house.
   -- Clerk at `Shotgun Pete's' quickie marriage emporium, ``''
   
 The minister cries, ``Next!'', and Homer and Marge march down the aisle,
 as Doris plays `Here Comes the Bride' on a synthesizer (with synthetic
 rhythm section).
   
   Minister: Dearly beloved, we are gathered here in the sight of God and
             this casino to join... [points at Homer]
   Homer:    Homer.
   Minister: ... and ... [points at Marge]
   Marge:    Marge.
   Minister: ... in holy matrimony.  Beautiful.
             [three minutes later]
             Do you, Marjorie Bouvier take Homer J. Simpson to be your
             lawful wedded husband?
   Marge:    I do.
   Minister: Homer, same question, names reversed.
   Homer:    I do.
   Minister: Then, by the power vested in my by the state gaming commission,
             I pronounce you man and wife.  Here's ten dollars worth of chips.
             You may kiss the bride.
   -- How ``''
   
 As the minister yells, ``Next!'', the photo is taken.

 Back at the Bouvier residence, Patty tells the `lovebirds' to keep it down.
 (Not that they were making much noise in the first place.)

 Marge tallies the bills and comes to an unpleasant conclusion.  Meanwhile,
 Homer shows Marge a `baby monitor' walkie-talkie.  Marge is concerned that
 they can't afford all the baby stuff.
   
   Homer: Hey, why don't I apply at the nuclear power plant?
          I hear they pay pretty well.
   Marge: I don't know.  I heard radiation can make you sterile.
   Homer: Pfft.  &lt;Now&gt; you tell me.
   -- ``''
   
 At the plant, there are only two positions available, and three applicants,
 Homer and two other men.  Smithers recognizes the other two as frat
 brothers at Alpha Tau.  They do the frat handshake, then sing a college
 song.  Homer tries to join their singing, but fails miserably.

 Meanwhile, Dr. Hibbert does a sonogram of the unborn Bart, who turns
 his back.  ``Hm, if I didn't know better, I'd swear he was trying to
 moon us.''

 Back at the job interview...
   
   Smithers: What would each of you say is your worst quality?
   Man 1:    Well, I &lt;am&gt; a workaholic.
   Man 2:    I push myself too hard.
   Homer:    Well, it takes me a long time to learn anything,
             I'm kind of a goof-off...
   Smithers: Okay, that'll do.
   Homer:    ... a little stuff starts disappearing from the workplace...
   Smithers: That's enough!
   -- Job interview, ``''
   
   Smithers: There's a problem with the reactor.  What do you do?
   Homer:    There's a problem with the reactor!?  We're all going to die!
             Aaaaaaaugh! [runs out in panic]
   -- Homer's job interview, ``''
   
 Marge goes through the bills, and Homer says he didn't get the job.
 (``They wanted someone good.'')  Marge invites Homer to feel the
 baby kicking.
   
   Homer: [to his unborn son]  Kid, I won't let you down.
          I swear to you, when you come out of there, the first
          thing you're gonna see is a man with a good job.
   Patty: Yeah, a doctor!
   -- ``''
   
 Homer tries various jobs, but screws up all of them.  First, he
 works at Ye Olde Candlemaker Shoppe in Olde Springfield Towne.  Then
 selling knives door-to-door for Slash-Co Knives.
   
   Homer: Good evening, Madam.  You have been selected by the good people of
          Slash-Co to reap the benefits of their new Nev-R-Dull knife edge.
          Here, shake hands with the Slash-Co!  [hands her the knife]
   Woman: [grabs the wrong end]  Aaaaaagh!
   Homer: [to himself]  Handle first, handle first...
   -- Homer's job experience, ``''
   
 He then works at the Pitiless Pup Attack Dog School, but not for long.
 Next, he attends a `Million$ for Nothing' seminar.
   
   First, let me assure you that this is not one of those shady pyramid
   schemes you've been hearing about.  No sir.  Our model is the trapezoid!
   -- Shady seminar speaker at `Million$ for Nothing', ``''
   
 The speaker hears a siren outside and leaps out the window (through
 the glass) in panic.
   
   Fourth notice.  Ninety days overdue.  We break thumbs.
   -- Marge reads the mail from bill collectors, ``''
   
 Men from Repo Depot come and take all the baby things, as well as
 Marge's ring.
   
   Repossessing stuff is the hardest part of my job.
   -- Man from the Repo Depot, ``''
   
 That evening, in the middle of the night, Homer goes to a desk and writes
 Marge a letter.  ``By the time you read this, I will be gone.''  He
 can't afford the things she deserves, and besides, her family doesn't
 like him.  (``Shut up with that pen scratching down there!'' yells Patty
 from upstairs.)  He promises to send her every cent he earns to support
 the child.  He leaves the note on Marge's desk and kisses her good-bye.
 Outside, he puts a `For Sale' sign on his car and moves the `DISCO
 SUCKS' bumper sticker from the car bumper to his suitcase before trudging
 off into the darkness...
   
   Lisa: [crying] That is so sad.
   Homer: Oh, come on, honey.  You know how it turns out.
          After all, you wouldn't be here today if I hadn't become the
          responsible head of a household.
   Bart:  [poking his head into the room]
          Hey, Homer, can we have a can of frosting for lunch?
   Homer: Okay.
   -- Edible complex, ``''
   
 [End of Act Two.  Time: 14:33]

 Marge finds Homer's note and cries.  Her sisters try to console her.
 (``I thought he'd two-time you for a while first.'')  At the Gulp-N-Blow,
 Patty finds hair in her taco, then spots Homer working behind the
 counter.  The sisters decide not to tell Marge.

 Marge is knitting at home, when she gets a letter from Homer.
 It contains $20 bills, and the simple note, ``Dear Marge, XXX.  Homer.''
 (Which Homer VO's literally.)

 Homer watches the SNPP employees arrive for work and gasps at the
 donut truck that goes in.

 A very pregnant Marge stands in the doorway, waiting for Homer to return.
 Patty can hold her tongue no longer.
   
   Marge, I've got two-and-a-half words for you.  Gulp.  'N'.  Blow.
   -- Patty tells Marge where she can find Homer, ``''
   
 Marge pulls up to the drive-through microphone.
   
   Homer: Yeah, whaddya want.
   Marge: My husband by my side.
   Homer: You want fries with that?
   -- Homer works at the Gulp-N-Blow, ``''
   
 The happy couple are reunited.  (``Holy cow, you're as big as a house!'')
 Marge asks Homer to come home.
   
   Look at me.  I'm a trainee.
   They won't even tell me what's in the secret sauce.
   -- Homer works at the Gulp-N-Blow, ``''
   
 Homer says he can't even afford a decent wedding ring, but Marge says that
 any ring is fine.  So Homer slips an onion ring on her finger.  Marge is
 touched, but adds, ``Would you mind if I took it off now?  The oil is
 burning my finger.''  Homer takes it off, and eats it.  Marge kisses Homer,
 adding, ``Come home soon,'' before driving off.  Homer tears off his
 trainee uniform and stuffs it in a `Thank you' trash bin.  He rushes
 to SNPP, going right past a security kiosk.  (The guard pays absolutely
 no notice.)
   
   That's it... That's it... Come closer... [gobbles a power pellet]
   Muhahaha!  Ironic isn't it.  The hunter has become the hunted!  Hahahaha!!
   -- Monty Burns plays Ms. Pac-Man, ``''
   
 Homer bursts into Burns' office.
   
   Listen to me, Mister Big-Shot.  If you're looking for the kind of employee
   that takes abuse, and never sticks up for himself, I'M YOUR MAN!  You can
   treat me like dirt, and I'll &lt;still&gt; kiss your butt and call it ice cream!
   And if you don't like it, I can change!!
   -- Homer demands a job from Monty Burns, ``''
   
   I like your attitude.  Feisty, yet spineless.
   -- Monty Burns hires Homer, ``''
   
   Sir, this man not only failed the aptitude test, he got trapped in a closet
   on his way out.
   -- Smithers voices his objections to the hiring of Homer Simpson,
      ``''
   
 Burns responds, ``I haven't been this impressed since I first laid eyes
 on a young bootlick named Wayland Smithers.  ...  Welcome aboard, son.''
   
   Only in America could I get a job!
   -- Homer celebrates being hired to work at SNPP, ``''
   
   Burns:    Who was that young hellcat, Smithers?
   Smithers: Homer Simpson, sir.
   Burns:    Simpson, eh?  I'll remember that name...
   -- The beginning of a tradition, ``''
   
 Homer returns home to Marge, to learn that she's at the hospital.
 Mrs. Bouvier grudgingly gives him a ride.

 Homer arrives and tells off Patty when she bad-mouths him.
   
   Homer:       Starting tomorrow, I'm a nuclear technician!
   Dr. Hibbert: Good God!
   -- A professional opinion, ``''
   
   Homer: And tomorrow, I'm going to buy your ring back, then I'm going
          house-hunting.
   Marge: Doesn't your job start tomorrow?
   Homer: Eh, somebody'll cover for me.
   -- Useful phrase #1, ``''
   
   Marge: [goes into labor] Oh!
   Homer: [rolls up his sleeves] Step aside.  I'll deliver this baby.
   Dr. H: Uh, why don't you let me handle it, Homer?
   Homer: [confrontationally] Oh, a college boy, eh?
   -- The birth of Bart, ``''
   
 Dr. Hibbert delivers a little Bart.
   
   Marge: Homey, isn't he beautiful?
   Homer: Hey, as long as he's got eight fingers and eight toes, he's fine
          by me.

 As Homer calls him ``Daddy's little angel'', Bart takes a lighter and
 sets Homer's necktie aflame.  ``Why you little!''

 Bart and Lisa are playing Chinese checkers, and Homer invites them to sit
 on his lap.
   
   Homer: You know, son, the day you were born, I received the greatest gift
          a man could have.  As the years went by, your mother and I were
          blessed twice more.  And not a day goes by that we don't thank God

 EPISODE TITLE: Radio Bart


EPISODE SUMMARY: 

 Homer finds Lisa dancing provocatively in front of the television.  She's
 watching a TV dance show, laden with pretty young girls dancing the same
 way.  Homer drools at the girls (reflected not only in his eyes, but
 also in his drool).
   
   Lisa:  Dad, can I have some money to buy Bart a birthday present?
   Homer: [entranced by a TV show of pretty girls dancing provocatively]
          Mon-ney.  [hands over a huge wad of bills]
   Lisa:  [riffles through it]  Dad, this is a hundred and ten dollars!
   Homer: Oh, sorry.  [gives her the entire wallet]
   -- Ask, and you shall receive, ``''
   
   `Funky-See Funky-Do' will be right back to lip-sync another of their
   hits, right after this...
   -- Announcer on TV music dance show, ``''
   
 Lisa leaves to go shopping, and a commercial comes on.  It's for one of
 those microphones that acts as a mini radio transmitter.  The commercial
 is your usual shameless plug, and Homer gobbles it, hook, line, and
 sinker.  Homer decides to buy it for Bart's birthday.
   
   Announcer: ... But order now.  Supply is limited.
   Homer:     Gasp!  Limited!?!?  [frantically dials the phone]
              Do you have any of those microphones left?
   Clerk:     [standing in a warehouse filled to the roof with boxes
              of microphones]  Yeah, a couple...
   -- A couple thousand, perhaps... ``''
   
 In bed, Homer tells Marge that this time, perhaps he will succeed at
 purchasing his son's affections.

 It's Bart's birthday.  Homer marks Bart's height on the wall.  (All the
 marks are zig-zagged, being outlines of Bart's spikey hair.)  Bart tunes in
 the Krusty the Klown Show in time to watch the birthday announcements.
 Sideshow Mel brings out a giant birthday cake, and Krusty trips him.
 Mel lands on his face, but the cake is intact.  As Mel gets up, Krusty
 kicks him in the butt, sending him headfirst into the cake.  Mel's
 hair catches fire on the candles.  (Later, we see Mel running frantically
 in the background, his hair still afire.)

 Krusty says it's time to see the names of the birthday boys and girls,
 and Bart watches his name scroll past (along with two dozen other names)
 at lightning speed.  ``Wow, best eight bucks I ever spent.''  Marge tells
 Bart that Grampa is on the phone to wish him a happy birthday.  ``Take a
 message.''  Bart brandishes a handful of 46 coupons for birthday goodies
 and heads out.

 First stop is a free birthday sundae at Phineas Q. Butterfat's.  The
 clerk gives Bart a tiny teaspoon-sized sundae.  Next is a free shave.
   
   Bart:   [in the barber shop, getting a shave]
           Digital audio tape, my butt!  When &lt;I&gt; was a kid, we had compact
           disks, and &lt;I&gt; don't recall no one complaining.
   Barber: Damn right.
   -- Bart's free shave, ``''
   
 Bart then gets his free tango lesson.  Although half the height of his
 partner, Bart dances divinely.  Bart excuses himself to go to his
 birthday party.  (``Farewell, Senor Bart,'' sighs Rosarita.)

 Bart arrives at the birthday party and greets his guests.
   
   Hey, good to see you.
   Glad you could make it.
   Toby, have you lost weight?
   -- Bart, the perfect host at his birthday party, ``''
   
 The kids harrass Wall E. Weasel, who is trying to deliver a pizza.
 Bart busies himself with a video game.  Later, he `talks' with the
 mechanical entertainment, which performs a birthday song.  (The
 lyrics sing to the `birthday boy or girl'.)  Until it catches fire,
 at least.

 Bart's first birthday gift is from Selma.  It's a label-maker.  Bart is
 hardly amused.  The other gifts are equally boring.  Homer gives Bart the
 radio microphone, but Bart merely calls, ``Next.''  Martin gives Bart a
 matching jacket and beret, identical to his own.

 Having nothing better to do, Bart labels everything in the house
 ``Property of Bart Simpson'' (including SLH).  Homer opens the fridge...
   
   Oh, there's only one can of beer left, and it's Bart's.
   -- Homer finds a `Property of Bart Simpson' sticker on a can of Duff,
      ``''
   
 Homer asks Bart how the microphone is working, to see it being used
 to prop the window open.  ``Bart, I would love to get a present like
 that.''  Bart hands it over.  ``Here you go.  Enjoy.''  Homer demonstrates
 the microphone, singing the song that was sung on the TV commercial,
 blasting his melodious voice out Lisa's radio.  Lisa covers her ears.
 (SLH howls in agreement.)

 He then makes an announcement for Marge over her radio, but she couldn't
 understand him because of the distortion.  Homer realizes his gift was
 a flop.

 In his room, Bart grouses, ``What a crappy birthday.''  Marge comes in
 and tells him the radio microphone isn't so bad.  She demonstrates.
 ``Testing, testing, one two three. ...  Oh my, do I sound like that?''
 Bart decides it might not be a total loss after all.

 Downstairs, Homer opens the freezer and pulls out a box of Neapolitan
 ice cream, to find that the chocolate is completely gone.  (The vanilla
 and strawberry are untouched.)  He pulls out a second box, with the
 same result.  ``Marge, we need some more vanilla, chocolate and
 strawberry ice cream!''  The radio crackles to life.
   
   People of earth, this is Bartron, commander of the Martian invasion force.
   Your planet is in our hands.  Resistance is useless.
   -- The first broadcast of ``''
   
 Only after he fetches a shotgun does Homer realize that it was Bart.
 ``Why you little...''  But he stops his strangling when he realizes
 that this means Bart actually &lt;liked&gt; his gift after all!  He makes
 Bart promise not to play any more practical jokes, and Bart agrees.
 (Bart surreptitiously slaps a ``Property of Bart Simpson'' label on
 Homer's butt.)

 [End of Act One.  Time: 6:41]

 Marge puts Maggie to bed and removes her pacifier.  As Marge turns
 to leave, we hear Maggie say, ``Mama!  Mama!''  Marge is amazed,
 then discovers a small radio hidden behind Maggie's pillow.

 Bart hides his microphone under Lisa's bed and uses it to snoop in
 on her conversation with one of her friends.

 In school, flatulent noises are heard when Ms. Krabappel sits down.
 Ms. K discovers the radio under her chair.

 Bart spots Rod and Todd sitting in their room listening to the radio.
   
   Bart: [over the radio] Rod!  Todd!  This is God!
   Rod:  How did you get on the radio?
   Bart: Whaddya mean, how did I get on the radio?  I created the universe!
         Stupid kid.
   Todd+Rod: [fall to their knees and clasp their hands]
   Todd: Forgive my brother.  We believe you.
   Bart: Talk is cheap.  Perhaps I'll test a guy's faith.  Walk through the
         wall!  I will remove it for you.
   Rod:  [walks into the wall]  [thud]
   Bart: Ha ha ha.
   Todd+Rod: [return to their knees in prayer]
   Todd: What do you want from us?
   Bart: I got a job for you.  Bring forth all the cookies from your kitchen
         and leave them on the Simpsons' porch.
   Rod:  But those cookies belong to our parents.
   Bart: Ugh!  Look, do you want a happy God or a vengeful God?
   Todd: [quickly]  Happy God.
   Bart: Then quit flapping your lip and make with the cookies!
   Todd+Rod: Yes, sir!
   -- How to win friends and influence people, ``''
   
 Bart twirls his microphone and blows across it, as if it were a
 six-shooter.

 Bart lowers his portable radio on a rope down a well, but he loses his
 grip, and it falls to the bottom.  Groundskeeper Willie hears a plaintive
 ``Help!  Help!'' coming from the well.  He takes a swig from his liquor
 flask and runs through traffic, returning with his plow.  Bart
 chuckles, ``Sucker!''

 Word travels quickly through town, and before you know it, the well
 is surrounded by the police, curious onlookers, and Kent Brockman.
 Bart identifies himself as Timmy O'Toole, an orphan who was turned
 away from Springfield Elementary by Principal Skinner on account of
 his shabby clothes.  Skinner denies this accusation.
   
   The circumference of the well is 34 inches, so, unfortunately, not
   one member of our city's police force is slender enough to rescue the
   boy.
   -- Kent Brockman's report, ``''
   
 (During Kent's report, we see Eddie bring a box of donuts from the
 food stand.  The other cops are already munching away.)  Chief
 Wiggum scolds his men, and when asked why &lt;he&gt; doesn't go down,
 he says, ``Well, I'm too... important.''

 Kent explains that Timmy's foot is caught under a rock, so they
 can't simply pull him up, lest he become injured.

 A falconer explains that his bird will fly the boy to safety.
 He releases the bird, which flies away, never to return.

 A man shows a fishhook and a bar of chocolate.  ``And then I'll
 clean him for free.''
   
   Although we can't reach the boy, we &lt;can&gt; freeze him with liquid
   nitrogen, so that future generations can rescue him.
   -- Dr. John Fink's plan to rescue poor Timmy O'Toole, ``''
   
 The Simpsons sit on the TV couch, metal trays set up in front of them.
   
   Dear Lord, before we peel the foil back from Your bounty...
   -- Marge's TV dinner prayer, ``''
   
 Marge asks the Lord to keep an eye on poor Timmy, and Bart laughs.
   
   Homer: That Timmy is a real hero!
   Lisa:  How do you mean, Dad?
   Homer: Well, he fell down a well, and... he can't get out.
   Lisa:  How does that make him a hero?
   Homer: Well, that's more than you did!
   -- ``''
   
 On TV...
   
   Channel 6's own Krusty the Klown has gathered members of the entertainment
   community, who normally steer clear of fashionable causes...
   -- Kent Brockman's news report, ``''
   
 Kent Brockman interviews Krusty regarding his new project, a video
 called We're Sending Our Love Down the Well.
   
   I called my good friend Sting.  He said, ``Krusty, when do you need me?''
   I said, ``Thursday.''  He said, ``I'm busy Thursday.''
   I said, ``What about Friday?''  He said, ``Friday's worse than Thursday.''
   Then &lt;he&gt; said, ``How about Saturday?''  I said, ``Fine.''  True story!
   -- Krusty makes his music video, ``''
   
 Kent interviews Sting and Krusty, then we see the resulting video.
   
   Sting:  There's a hole in my heart as deep as a well for that poor little boy,
           who's stuck halfway to Hell...
   Sideshow Mel: Though we can't get him out, we'll do the next best thing...
   McBane: We go on TV and sing, sing, sing!
   All:    And we're sending our love down the well...
   Krusty: All the way down!
   All:    We're sending our love down the well...
   Krusty: Down that well!
   -- Krusty's music video, ``''
   
 Kent asks Krusty what he's going to do with the royalties.  Krusty explains
 that first, they have to pay for promotion, shipping, distribution, the
 limos they rented...  Whatever's left over, they throw down the well.

 The field around the well has turned into a Timmy O'Toole amusement park.

 Lisa watches another ridiculously violent Itchy and Scratch cartoon,
 this one with a well theme, and dedicated to Timmy O'Toole.  Meanwhile,
 SLH has gotten his hands, er, mouth on Bart's microphone, and growls
 emerge from the well.  The cartoon is interrupted for a special report,
 and Kent asks Dr. Marvin Monroe for an explanation.  Monroe explains that
 the child is returning to a feral stage.  He shows an artists's conception,
 which looks like a young wolfman.  Lisa sees Bart struggling to
 recover the microphone and puts two and two together.  Bart finally gets
 the mike and explains (in his Timmy voice) that he was trying to chew his
 foot off, then pretends to go to sleep.  Lisa tells Bart that when the
 townspeople realize that it was a hoax, they're going to want to kill him.
 Bart asks how they'll find out.  Lisa says, ``I bet you were stupid enough
 to have left a `Property of Bart Simpson' label on that radio.''  We take
 a wild ride through Springfield, down the well, and focus on the label
 Lisa described.  (Bart:  ``D'oh!'')

 That evening, the two cops read the Cinderella story down the well for
 Timmy, then go for a coffee break.  While they're gone, Bart ties a rope
 to a tree stump and rappels down the well.  (He's wearing a flashlight
 taped to his lucky red hat so he can see where he's going.)  The cops
 return, and Eddie says, ``Hey, I almost tripped over this thing,'' and
 unhooks the rope from the stump.  Bart screams as he falls...

 [End of Act Two.  Time: 14:27]

 Bart lands with a thud at the bottom of the well.  Poetically enough, his
 foot is trapped under a rock.  (``What did I do to deserve this?'')
 Bart yells for help and admits to his practical joke.  The cops decide
 to pull their own prank:  They leave.

 The two cops tell Homer and Marge that Bart is trapped down the well.

 Homer and Marge pay a visit to the well, which has drawn a small crowd.
   
   Don't worry, son.  Just 'cuz you're trapped in a hole doesn't mean you
   can't live a rich and full life.
   -- Homer's reassuring words, ``''
   
 Homer tosses down Bart's Krusty doll, which lands on Bart's head.  Bart
 complains, ``Ow!  Knock it off, you bald boob!''  Homer threatens, ``Hey,
 don't make me come down there!''

 Chief Wiggum says they've located a piece of machinery in Shreveport,
 Louisiana, but there's no room in the budget to bring it to Springfield.
   
   Your boy picked a bad time to fall down a well.  If he'd done it
   at the start of the fiscal year, no problemo.
   -- Chief Wiggum tells Marge it's all in the timing, ``''
   
 Kent interviews Homer and Marge...
   
   Kent:  The time has come for finger-pointing, and most of them are
          squarely aimed at the boy's parents.
   Homer: It's not our fault!  We didn't want the boy, he was an accident!
   Marge: Homer!
   Homer: Uh...  Could you edit that last part out?
   Kent:  Mr. Simpson, we're live, coast-to-coast.
   Homer: D'oh!
   -- `''
   
 The next morning, girls have already made up a jumprope rhyme about Bart.
 Lisa tells them to stop, and they do.  But once she's gone, they continue.
   
   And our &lt;new&gt; number one hit, ``I Do Believe We're Naked'', by
   Funky-See Funky-Do, replaces ``We're Sending Our Love Down the Well'',
   which plunges all the way down to number 97.
   -- Casey Kasem's countdown, ``''
   
 At a press conference...
   
   Ever since I called for the rescue of that Simpson lad, I have taken a lot
   of heat.  So, I am flip-flopping!  I say, let him stay down there!
   -- Mayor Diamond Joe Quimby, bending ever so gently, ``''
   
 Roving Reporter Dave Shutton composes his story, ``Town to Well Boy:
 No more free food''.  He gets a hot lead and speeds off.  The Springfield
 Shopper headline reads, ``Squirrel resembling Abraham Lincoln found.''

 Marge and Homer pay a late-night visit to the well.
   
   Marge: Bart honey, I made you an extra-warm sweater you can wear while you're
          down in the well.  [tosses it]
   Bart:  Mom, it's too big.
   Homer: Don't worry, you'll grow into it.
   -- Bart is trapped in a well, ``''
   
   You know, I've done a lot of bad stuff through the years.
   I guess now I'm paying the price.  But there's so many things
   I'll never get a chance to do.  Smoke a cigarette, use a fake ID,
   shave a swear word in my hair... [sobs]
   -- Bart's remorse, ``''
   
 Homer has had enough and grabs a shovel to start digging; Marge fetches
 a wheelbarrow.  Groundskeeper Willie says to himself, ``Now why didn't I
 think of that?'' and tears off his shirt, revealing an impressive physique.
 He joins Homer with a shovel.  A man appears out of nowhere with a pick-axe.

 Kent Brockman interrupts with a special bulletin:  The Lincoln Squirrel
 has been assassinated!

 Pretty soon, the entire town has joined the digging effort.  Apu discovers
 a dead canary, and everybody rushes out in panic.  Dr. Hibbert concludes
 that the canary died of natural causes, and everybody goes back.

 Sting continues shoveling...
   
   Marge: Sting, you look tired.  Maybe you should take a rest.
   Sting: Not while one of my fans needs me.
   Marge: Actually, I don't know if I've ever heard Bart play one of your albums.
   Homer: Shhhh.  Marge, he's a good digger!
   -- Digging Bart out of a well, ``''
   
 Once Sting breaks through, Homer and Marge push him out of the way so they
 can check on Bart.  Homer tells Bart, ``Don't worry, son.  They're going
 to make sure no one ever falls down this well again.''  After the field
 is restored to its former glory, Groundskeeper Willy hammers into the ground
 about thirty feet from the well a small sign that reads simply, ``Caution:
 Well.''  ``Thaht should dew it.''

 EPISODE TITLE: Lisa the Greek


EPISODE SUMMARY: 

 We begin with a computer-generated sequence, depicting two football
 players approaching each other.  The red-uniformed player (#86) sticks
 out his arm, decapitating the blue-uniformed player (#12), whose head
 flies off (with a shocked expression), sailing through the logo, ``Inside
 Football Today.''  Brent Gunsilman welcomes the home audience to ``six
 hours of exciting football action.''  Homer, surrounded by his favorite
 salt- and cholesterol-laden treats, announces ``Bye-bye belt!'', whips
 off his belt, and lets it all hang out.  He then digs in ferociously.
 Marge sees him and warns him that those foods aren't good for his heart.
 Homer scoffs, ``My heart is just fine.''  We take an inside look at Homer's
 chest cavity, where an aorta blows up like a balloon (presumably due to a
 clogged artery), but the danger is averted when the clog clears, and
 the blood continues on its way.  (``A little beer will put out &lt;that&gt;
 fire,'' says Homer.)
   
   And now, with his picks for today's games, the man who's right 52% of
   the time, Smooth Jimmy Apollo!
   -- Brent Gunsilman hosts a football pre-game show, ``''
   
 Jimmy says the Denver/New England game is too close to call.  ``But
 if you're one of those compulsive types who just has to bet, well,
 I don't know... um... Denver.''  Homer celebrates.  ``Woo hoo!
 Denver!  Yeah!''  Homer calls Moe.
   
   Moe's Tavern, where the peanut bowl is freshened hourly.
   -- Moe answers the phone, ``''
   
 Homer puts $20 on Denver, and Moe accepts the bet.  (He has to ask
 Chief Wiggum to hand him his notebook, which Wiggum had been using
 as a coaster.)
   
   At the end of thirteen seconds of play,
   it's New England seven, Denver nothing.
   -- The football report, ``''
   
 Lisa steps in front of the TV, blocking Homer's view.
   
   Look Dad, I made a modern studio apartment for my Malibu Stacy doll.

   This is the kitchen, this is where she prints her weekly feminist
   newsletter...
   -- Lisa's latest triumph, ``''
   
 But Homer isn't paying any attention.  (``Lousy stupid Denver...'')

 Marge gives Maggie a bath and shampoo in the sink.  Marge praises
 Lisa's work.
   
   Lisa:  Why isn't Dad ever interested in anything I do?
   Marge: Well, um, do you ever take an interest in anything &lt;he&gt; does?
   Lisa:  No. ... Well, we used to have burping contests, but I outgrew it.
   -- ``''
   
   Well, if you want to get closer to him, then maybe &lt;you&gt; should bridge the
   gap.  I do it all the time.  I pretend I'm interested in looking at power
   tools, going to those silly car-chase movies, and ... some things I'll tell
   you about when you're older.
   -- Marge's advice to Lisa, ``''
   
 Bart slips a dish into the bathwater and receives a brief scolding.

 In the third quarter, New England is winning, 35 to 7.  Lisa suggests
 that she watch the game with Homer, and he reluctantly agrees.  ``Just
 don't say anything and sit down over there.''  Lisa plops on the couch,
 and Homer tells her to keep moving over until she's at the far end of
 the sofa.  Lisa sighs.  Homer scolds, ``Lisa, please, I can't hear the
 announcer.''  ``He said Denver just fumbled.''  ``D'oh!''

 In the yard, Bart uses a magnifying glass to melt a plastic soldier toy.
 (``See you in hell, soldier boy!'')  Marge suggests that, since Homer and
 Lisa are inside watching the game, it ``might be fun'' for Bart to go
 shopping for clothes with her.  Bart maintains that he doesn't need new
 clothes, though his point is undermined by the holes in the shirt and pants
 he's currently wearing.

 Back to `Inside Football Today', where New England has defeated Denver
 by a score of 55 to 10.
   
   Smooth Jimmy Apollo:  [explaining his poor prediction]
          Well, folks, when you're right 52% of the time, you're wrong 48%
          of the time.
   Homer: Why didn't you say that before!!
   -- Watching a TV football post-game show, ``''
   
 On the Miami/Cincinnati game, Jimmy picks Miami as his Lock of the Week.
 On another channel, another broadcaster selects Cincinnati as his Shoe-in
 of the Week.  On another channel, Professor John Fink's high-tech computer
 picks Cincinnati, by 200 points?!  He kicks his ``worthless hunk of junk.''
 On another channel, Homer falls for a TV ad for a phone-in guaranteed-win
 football pick.  Homer calls...
   
   TV:    So call me now!  $5 for the first minute, $2 for each additional minute!
   Homer: [dials the number]
   Voice: You... have reached... the Coach's...  Hot-...
   Homer: Line.
   Voice: Line.
   Homer: Yeah, lay it on me, Coach.
   Voice: In the game... of... Mi... am... i...
   Homer: Mm hm.
   Voice: Versus Cin...
   Homer: Cincinnati.
   Voice: cin...
   Homer: Cincinnati.
   Voice: nat...
   Homer: Cincinnati.
   Voice: i...
   Homer: Come on, come on, don't you realize this is costing me money!
   -- Dial 1-909-WIN-BIGG for football picks, ``''
   
 Homer eventually gives up.  In desperation he asks Lisa who she picks.
 ``I don't know.  The Dolphins?''  Homer phones in a $50 bet on the
 Dolphins.  Moe's call waiting kicks in, and he takes a call from Krusty,
 phoning in his $700 bet on the Rams from backstage.  (The show is taping.)
 Sideshow Mel honks his horn twice, which Krusty interprets as a $2000 bet.

 Marge drags Bart to `Wee Monsieur'', a clothing store for young men.
   
   Mom, I'm tired.  I want to go home.  Can't I just lie down for a minute?
   -- Bart whines about being forced to shop for clothes, ``''
   
 There, she loads up Bart with brightly-patterned clothes.
   
   Bart:  You know why these clothes are on sale, Mom?
          Because the people who wear them get beaten up.
   Marge: Well, anyone who beats you up for wearing a shirt isn't your friend.
   -- More words of wisdom from Marge, ``''
   
 Bart's arms are loaded with clothes, the pile reaching above his head.
 Marge scolds, ``And don't make that face at me.''  Bart responds, ``How'd
 you know?''

 The Dolphins score a touchdown, and Homer celebrates (spilling his Duff
 in the process).  Lisa copies Homer's cheering.  Homer lets slip that
 he bet $50 on the game.  Lisa doesn't understand why.
   
   What could be more exciting than the savage ballet that is pro football?
   -- Lisa, ``''
   
 Homer tries an analogy.
   
   Homer: You like ice cream, don't you?
   Lisa:  Uh huh.
   Homer: And don't you like ice cream better when it's covered with hot fudge?
          And mounds of whipped cream?  [getting carried away]  And chopped nuts?
          And, ooh, those crumbled-up cookie things they mash up?
          Mmm...  Crumbled-up cookie things...
   -- Homer's train of thought gets derailed yet again, ``''
   
 Lisa concludes that ``gambling makes a good thing even better.''
 Homer realizes that there is some kind of bond between him and his daughter.

 Bart changes in the fitting room and sees the sign ``This room monitored
 at all times.''  He spots a TV camera, so he takes some cardboard backing
 and makes the sign, ``Get bent.''  The security men
 who are watching the monitors spot a little girl putting on socks.  ``Those
 aren't the socks she came in with!''  Armed with high-powered rifles, they
 head out.

 Marge checks up on Bart, who at the moment is dressed only in his briefs.
 Everybody in the store chuckles at Bart's embarrassing situation.

 Homer and Lisa celebrate Miami's 24-10 victory over Cincinnati.
 Homer then tells Lisa not to breathe a word about Homer's gambling to
 Marge.
   
   Homer: Your mother has this crazy idea that gambling is wrong.
          Even though they say it's okay in the bible.
   Lisa:  Really?  Where?
   Homer: Uh... Somewhere in the back.
   -- ``''
   
 Marge returns from shopping and says that Bart is modelling his new clothes
 for his friends.  Bart is in the car, dressed in plaid.  The car is shaking.
 We see the reason:  Jimbo, Kerny, and Dolph are pushing the car up and down.
 ``You gotta come out &lt;sometime&gt;, Simpson.''

 [End of Act One]

 Homer tucks Lisa into bed.
   
   Lisa:  Can I watch football with you again next Sunday?
   Homer: Sure!  You'll find it gets rid of the unpleasant aftertaste of church.
   -- Sundays of thunder?  ``''
   
 Homer leaves and Marge enters.  Marge is pleased that her advice worked,
 and Lisa asks,  ``Could you loosen my blanket a little?  Dad tucked me
 in too tight, and it's cutting off the circulation in my arms and legs.''

 Homer and Lisa watch a pre-game show.
   
   Football player:  [being interviewed]
          This team is fired up.  We came here to play!
   Homer: Aw right!  [picks up the phone to place his bet]
   Lisa:  [scoffing]  He'll lose.
   Homer: What?  Didn't you hear what he said?
   Lisa:  Look at the fear in his eyes, listen to the quiver in his voice.
          [poetically] He's a little boy lost in a game of men.
   -- ``''
   
   Homer: You think we should bet against them?
   Lisa:  I'd bet my entire college fund on it.
   Homer: You got it.  [to phone]  Moe, twenty-three dollars on New York!
   -- ``''
   
 New York defeats Philadelphia 35-10.
   
   Homer: [tossing Lisa in the air in celebration]  Yaay!
   Lisa:  Yaay!
   Homer: [continues tossing]
   Lisa:  Whoa!
   Homer: [continues tossing]
   Lisa:  Dad, I hate to break the mood, but I'm getting nauseous.
   -- ``''
   
   Homer: Who do you like in the afternoon games?
   Lisa:  Well, I like the 49ers because they're pure of heart,
          Seattle because they've got something to prove,
          and the Raiders because they always cheat.
          [later]
   Brent: And on an extreeeeeemely suspicious play, the Raiders win!
   -- ``''
   
 Homer and Lisa cheer.

 Lisa pays a visit to the Springfield Public Library.
   
   [Under the banner ``The Library / The Hip Place To Be'' sits a lone reader]
   Lisa: Hey, the new sign's really working!
   Mrs. Norton:  Oh, it's been a madhouse, Lisa!
   -- Give a hoot, ``''
   
   [Lisa flips through the card catalog]
   Let's see... Football... Football... `Homoeroticism in'...
   `Oddball Canadian rules'... `Phyllis George and'...
   -- Let your fingers do the walking, ``''
   
 Maggie, Homer and Lisa watch the conclusion of another game.  Maggie
 has a tiny football in her hand and tries to throw it, but she falls
 at the same time, making her throw more of a spike.  The final score
 is announced, Atlanta 17, Houston 13.  ``Who woulda thunk it!''
   
   Homer: Lisa, you picked the winner every time.  You must have some
          kind of special gift!
   Lisa:  Come on, Dad.  It doesn't take a genius to realize that Houston's
          failed to cover their last ten outings on away turf the week after
          scoring more than three touchdowns in a conference game.
   Homer: Oh, my little girl says the cutest things.
   -- ``''
   
 Lisa adds, ``Sunday is fast becoming my favorite day of the week.''
 Homer corrects her, ``Not Sunday.  Daddy-daughter day.''

 Homer comes into Moe's Tavern and orders the usual, ``a beer, and a wad
 of bills!''  Moe quietly grumbles as he takes $135 out of his boot to pay
 Homer.  ``I used to hate the smell of your sweaty feet.  [inhales]  Now
 it's the smell of victory.''  (``Shut up,'' mutters Moe.)

 Homer takes the family to The Gilded Truffle, a very expensive restaurant.
   
   Gasp!  Look at these prices!  We could finally get rid of those termites
   for the cost of this meal!
   -- Marge reads the menu for The Gilded Truffle, ``''
   
 Marge asks where Homer got the money to pay for it, and Lisa asks, ``Can't
 a man do something nice for his loved ones?''
   
   Waiter: Hello, I'm Marco, I'll be your waiter.
   Homer:  Hello, I'm Homer, I'll be your customer.
           [Homer, Bart, and Lisa chuckle]
   Waiter: Never heard that one before...
   -- At The Gilded Truffle, ``''
   
   Waiter: Would you care to select the wine?
   Bart:   I'll do the honors.  [takes the wine list, reads it]
           No, no, no, no!  My God!  What passes for a wine list these days?
           Marco, just bring us your freshest bottle of wine, chop-chop.
   -- At The Gilded Truffle, ``''
   
   Homer: Oh, violin guy! [strolling violinist approaches]
          [tucks some money in the violinist's pocket]
          What's your favorite song, Lisa?
   Lisa:  The Broken Neck Blues.
   Homer: [to violinist] Play on.
   -- At The Gilded Truffle, ``''
   
 Back to watching football on TV.
   
   Brent:  It is the playoffs. It's five below, and there's one loyal fan
           wearing nothing but a G-string, and the team colors painted on
           his body!
           [camera shows the fan in question, shivering, teeth chattering]
   Johnny: He doesn't look too happy!
   Brent:  Heh heh.  Well, maybe the paint has shut off his pores, and
           he's slowly suffocating.  Still, &lt;that&gt; is a &lt;real&gt; fan.
   -- Football pre-game show, ``''
   
 Lisa is on the floor with a calculator and some note paper.  Her
 computations complete, Lisa places her pencil behind her ear.
   
   Homer: Well, Lisa, it's daddy-daughter day, and Daddy needs daughter's picks.
   Lisa:  Dad, I'm making the Chiefs my five-star silver bullet special.
          And with your blessing, I'd like to tie it to the Cowboys plus
          five at Chicago.
   -- ``''
   
 Homer lets Lisa phone in the bet.  (``This is L.S. calling for H.S.'')

 Moe pays Homer his winnings.
   
   Barney: Hey, Homer, you wanna go bowling next Sunday?
   Homer:  Barney, are you nuts?  That's the Super Bowl!
           How about the Sunday after that?
   Barney: Well, my Ma's coming in from Norway, but uh, what the hell. [belch]
   -- ``''
   
 Lisa's class are reading their essays on the theme, ``The Happiest Day
 of My Life.''
   
   Ralph: ... and when the doctor said I didn't have worms any more, that
          was the happiest day of my life.
   Mrs. Hoover:  Thank you, Ralph, very graphic.
   -- Reading essays in front of the class, ``''
   
 Lisa is up next.
   
   The happiest day of my life was three Sundays ago.  I was sitting on my
   daddy's knee when the Saints, who were four-and-a-half point favorites,
   but only up by three, kicked a meaningless field goal at the last second
   to cover the spread.
   -- Lisa's essay, The Happiest Day of My Life, ``''
   
 ``Dear God,'' says Mrs. Hoover.

 At home, Homer brings the family gifts.
   
   Lisa:  Oh, Dad!  You must have bought me every Malibu Stacy accessory there
          is!
   Homer: Not quite.  They were out of Malibu Stacy lunar rovers.
   -- Homer's surprise gift, ``''
   
   Ooh, perfume!  Meryl Streep's Versatility!
   -- Marge's gift from Homer, ``''
   
 Maggie gets a stuffed elephant, which she tosses aside, preferring to
 play with the bubble wrap the animal was wrapped in.  (Pop!  Pop!)
   
   Homer: Boy, I know you're going to like your present.
   Bart:  [it's a hand-held gizmo with three buttons]
          [Bart presses each button a few times]
   Toy:   Shut up!  Shut up!
          Kiss my butt!
          Shut up!
          Go to hell!  Go to hell!
   Bart:  Dad, I promise you, I will &lt;never&gt; get tired of this.
   -- ``''
   
 At bedtime...
   
   Marge: Homer, those were very thoughtful presents, but you have to tell
          me where you got the money from.
   Homer: All right, Marge, I'll tell you, but first you have to promise you
          will not get mad.
   Marge: I promise I &lt;will&gt; get mad, because I always do when you make me
          promise I won't.
   Homer: All right, if you must know.  Lisa and I have been gambling on pro
          football.
   Marge: Homer!!
   Homer: You promised you wouldn't get mad!
   -- ``''
   
 Marge is furious, but Homer tries to explain that Lisa never picks wrong;
 she has a gift.
   
   Homer: Aren't parents supposed to encourage their kids whenever they show
          talent?
   Marge: But gambling is illegal!
   Homer: Oh, only in 48 states.  Besides, it's a victimless crime.
          The only victim is Moe!  Heh heh heh.
   -- Homer has been using Lisa to help him make bets on football,
     ``''
   
 Homer says, ``What's the problem?  The kids are happy, you smell like
 Meryl Streep, and I got that foot massager I always wanted.  Believe
 me, Marge, nothing bad could possibly come of this.''  (Homer forgets
 to knock on wood.)

 At the dinner table, Homer's foot is still soaking in the foot massager.
   
   You know, Dad, we've been watching a lot of TV lately.  Maybe the Sunday
   after the Super Bowl we could hike up to the top of Mount Springfield.
   The fires in the tire yard really make for some beautiful sunsets!
   -- Lisa, ``''
   
 Homer says he's going bowling with Barney.  ``What about Daddy-daughter
 day?'' ``Don't worry, the new football season is only seven months away.''
 Lisa tearfully concludes that Homer was merely using her.  Marge
 scolds, ``You're a very selfish man.''  Bart's toy says, ``Go to hell!
 Go to hell.''  Bart adds, ``Hey, once again, great present, Dad.''

 [End of Act Two]

 Lisa tosses and turns in her sleep.  She dreams that she is a tired adult
 with too much make-up, at a casino smoking a cigarette.
   
   Adult Lisa: My third husband bought me this.  [takes off her ring]
               Gimme some [casino] chips for it!
   Clerk:      Are you sure, ma'am?
   Adult Lisa: Don't tell me what to do, sonny.  I've been gambling since I
               was eight, and I've been hocking jewelry since I was twelve!
               Now gimme some chips!
   -- Lisa's nightmare, ``''
   
 Lisa wakes up with a start.
   
   Look around you, Malibu Stacy.  All this was bought with dirty money.
   Your penthouse, your Alfa Romeo, your collagen injection clinic...
   -- Lisa talks to her doll, ``''
   
 Lisa returns Malibu Stacy to her shoebox.  ``It may not pretty, but dammit,
 it's honest.''  She takes down a Corey poster, curls it into a megaphone,
 and announces that she is giving away all her ill-gotten Malibu Stacy
 accessories.  Girls stampede down the sidewalk (Bart escapes with his
 life) and clean out Lisa's bedroom of said ill-gotten accessories.
 Homer arrives with a Malibu Stacy chinchilla coat, which a girl snatches.
 Lisa says, ``So you've come to buy my forgiveness.  Sorry, Homer.''
 Homer says he enjoyed watching football together, and Lisa admits that she
 did, too.  Homer invites her to watch the Super Bowl, and Lisa agrees.
 Homer then asks Lisa for her pick, and her demeanor changes.
   
   Lisa:  Look, Dad.  I'll tell you who's going to win the Super Bowl if you
          want me to, but it'll just validate my theory that you cared more
          about winning money than you did about me.
   Homer: Okay.
   -- ``''
   
 Lisa picks Washington.  ``However, I may also be so clouded with rage that
 subconsciously, I want you to lose.  In which case, I'd bet the farm on
 Buffalo.''  Homer asks her a second time.  ``If I still love you,
 Washington.  If I don't, Buffalo.''

 Homer glumly soaks a chip in dip while watching the pre-game show.
   
   Brent:  We're live from the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome, and Super Bowl XXVI.
           Today, we're going to be seen by people in one hundred and fifty
           countries, all over the world!

 Homer hears Lisa's saxophone wailing from upstairs.  ``Oh, every note
 is like a dagger in my heart.''  He leaves.
   
   Moe:    [answering the phone] Moe's Tavern, home of the Super Sunday Brunch
           Spectacular!
   Barney: [surveying the buffet table]  Whoa!  Baloney!  Bread!
   Moe:    [jotting in his notebook]  I've got you down for forty bucks.
           Good luck, Your Eminence.
   -- Super Bowl Sunday, ``''
   
 Moe sees Homer and tells him he's out of the bookie business.  Barney
 notes that Moe has been taking bets all day, and Moe shuts him up with
 a free beer.  Homer tells Moe he's not placing a bet, and Moe snatches
 the beer back.  (And pours it down the drain.)
   
   I had the greatest gift of all.  A little girl who could pick football.

          the game!
   Troy:  Thanks, Brent.  My new show is called `Handle with Care'.

          retired criminal.  We're the original Odd Couple!

 Lisa asks for the score, and Bart reports, ``You hate Dad is up by a

 ``They wanted it more,'' notes Moe.
   
   Barney: Hey Homer, didn't you say that if Duff Dry wins [the Duff Bowl],
           your daughter loves you?
   Homer:  Not Duff Dry.  Washington!
   Barney: Okay, okay.  They're &lt;both&gt; great teams.

 The Redskins score a touchdown.

   for eight more years!

 At sunset the following Sunday, Lisa and Homer reach the top of Mount
 Springfield.  (Lisa managed to climb the mountain in her red dress.
 Homer is completely out of breath.)  Homer pants, ``It's... beautiful. ...

 is enhanced by the Springfield Tire Yard Fire burning below.

 EPISODE TITLE: Homer Alone


EPISODE SUMMARY: 

 In `Road Runner' style, Homer chases Bart around the house.
   
   BART (Brat'us Don'thaveacow'us)
   HOMER (Homo Neanderthal'us)
   -- The Simpsons meet the Road Runner, ``''
   
 In the mayhem, Homer knocks a lamp off its stand, sending it crashing onto
 the floor.  Marge inspects the mess.
   
   I am &lt;not&gt; cleaning that!  ...  Oh, who am I kidding.
   -- Marge cleans up another mess, ``''
   
 Maggie lies in her crib, and Marge arrives with a bottle of formula.
 But Marge is unable to remove the pacifier from Maggie's mouth.
   
   When you grow up, you can suck your pacifier all you want.
   -- Marge tries to reason with Maggie, ``''
   
 Success.  While Maggie sucks on her bottle, Marge changes her, then
 places her over her shoulder to burp her.  Maggie belches.

 In the kitchen, Marge fixes everyone's lunch.
   
   Marge: [making lunch]  Extra mustard for Bart, sliced diagonally, not
          lengthwise.  Light mayo for Lisa, cut off the crust.  Double
          baloney for Homer...
   Lisa:  [simultaneously] Mom, can you sign this permission slip for my
   Bart:  [simultaneously] Mom, have you seen my lucky red cap?  Mom,
   Lisa:  [simultaneously] field trip?  Mom, I &lt;hate&gt; those pimentos, they
   Bart:  [simultaneously] where's my lucky red cap?  Mom, aren't you listening
   Lisa:  [simultaneously] make me gag.
   Bart:  [simultaneously] to me?  I told...
   Homer: [comes in]
   Lisa:  [simultaneously] Mom, please sign the permission slip.  [etc]
   Bart:  [simultaneously] Mom, I'm talking to you.  Hello?  Hello!  I'm going to
   Homer: [simultaneously] Marge, I split my pants again.  Ooooh!  Can I have two
   Lisa:  [simultaneously] [etc] without lunch.
   Bart:  [simultaneously] be crushed today if I don't wear my lucky red
   Homer: [simultaneously] sandwiches today?  Make them baloney sandwiches, too,
   Lisa:  [simultaneously] Mommm!  I can't eat those pimentos...
   Bart:  [simultaneously] cap!  Mommmm!  Wheeeere's my caaaaap!
   Homer: [simultaneously] can I have two slices of baloney and...
   Marge: ONE AT A TIME!   ONE AT A TIME!
          [pause]
   Lisa:  [simultaneously] So when you make the sandwich, no pimentos &lt;please!&gt;
   Bart:  [simultaneously] [etc]
   Homer: [simultaneously] Double baloney!  Double baloney!  Don't forget to make
   Lisa:  [simultaneously] Because you know how much they...
   Bart:  [simultaneously] Mommm!  Where's my lucky red cap!
   Homer: [simultaneously] it &lt;double&gt; baloney because you can hardly taste
                           the baloney...
   -- ``''
   
 Marge tells them enough is enough.  She pokes out the pimentos in Lisa's
 lunch meat.  Bart's hat is where he left it, behind the toilet.  Marge
 will sew Homer's pants, but she's out of baloney.

 Marge is loaded down with bags, Maggie, and the cat (in a carrier), as she
 goes over her list of errands one last time.  Homer asks Marge to take
 his bowling ball to Nick's; there's a bottle cap stuck in the thumb hole.
 Marge says, ``Can't you just use one of the balls at the alley?''  Homer
 whines, ``Ohhhhh!  Alley balls!''  Marge gives in.  ``Just put it in my
 left hand.''  He does.  This throws Marge's balance out of kilter.

 Marge spots the school bus outside and tells the kids to hurry up.
 ``No way.''  ``Never happen.''  The bus speeds off.  Says Bart, ``Well
 I'll be damned.''

 With Maggie in the passenger seat (eating the shoulder belt), Marge
 drives the kids to school.
   
   Lisa: Mom, Bart's making faces at me.
   Bart: It's a nervous twitch, and I'm a little sensitive about it,
         if you don't mind.
   -- ``''
   
 Bart continues to make faces, prompting Lisa to yell, ``Bart, quit
 it!  Quit it!  Hey, quit it!  Quit it!  Quit it!  Quit it!  Mom!!!!!!''

 The car skids to a halt in front of school.  Marge yells, ``&lt;Get!&gt;
 &lt;Out!&gt;''  Bart and Lisa do, and the car speeds off.

 Grocery shopping.  Marge fetches fruit leather, cheap imitation orange
 drink, Krusty-brand duck sausage pizza...  When Marge leaves the cart alone,
 Maggie throws things out of the cart.  Including a glass jar.  (*smash*)

 Marge goes to Nick's Bowling Shop, to find that she got the wrong Nick's.
 So she goes to the Nick's on the other side of town.  But that's not the
 right one either.

 Driving home, Marge turns on the radio and hears jackhammering.  It's a
 headache commercial.  Next station.  ``It's time for another Bill-and-Marty
 Classic Crank Call.''  They call a man and tell him his wife is dead.
 Then laugh uproariously.  Marge growls some more.  As Marge drives, the
 nerve-wracking events of the day swirl around her head.  Meanwhile, Maggie
 tugs on the nipple of her bottle, eventually succeeding in removing the
 top and spilling milk over the entire car (including Homer's dry-cleaned
 bowling uniform).  This proves too much.  Marge yells, ``Nooooooooooooo!!''
 and skids the car to a halt in the middle of the Springfield Memorial Bridge.
 She then calmly puts the car in park and turns off the ignition.  Traffic
 piles up.  A bus driver comes up to the car window and says, ``Okay, lady,
 this better be good.''  Marge roars.  The man backs off.
   
   This is Arnie Pie with Arnie in the Sky.  We've got big problems on the
   Springfield Memorial Bridge, people.  Traffic going waaaay back in both
   directions.  And look out at the corner of 14th and Elm, because I just
   dropped my bagel.
   -- Helicopter traffic report, ``''
   
   Eddie:  She's locked in the car and refuses to move.
   Wiggum: Did you flash your lights?
   Eddie:  Yes.
   Wiggum: [thinks]  Well, &lt;I'm&gt; fresh out of ideas.
   -- ``''
   
 Otto takes the opportunity to sunbathe atop the bus.  A mobster yells,
 ``Come on!  I got a body in the trunk!''  Krusty scolds Mr. Teeny for
 screwing around with the car radio.

 Arnie is joined by Kent Brockman.  Kent is lowered from the helicopter
 (wearing a helmet-mounted camera) for an exclusive interview.  But he
 is given too much slack and falls past the bridge.  As they try to
 pull him back up, he bounces against the brick-faced bridge.  (``Ow!'')

 Homer watches the report on television and jokes with his coworkers.
 Until he sees who the unappreciated housewife in question is.  (``D'oh!'')

 [End of Act One.  Time: 5:17]

 (Reeboks are really cool.  Drive a Pontiac.  Wash your hair with Permasoft.
  Eat Cracker Barrel cheese.  Watch Roc.  Watch In Living Color.  Watch 90210.
  Drive a Volvo.  Back to the show.)

 Homer pushes to the front of the crowd, and Chief Wiggum gives him
 a megaphone.
   
   Wiggum: Try to talk her out of there.
           [hands Homer a megaphone]
           But don't put your lips on it or anything.
   -- ``''
   
   Homer: [through a megaphone] Hello?  Hello?  Is this thing on?  Hello?
   Marge: Homer, is that you?
   Homer: [aside] What should I say?
   Wiggum: Well, how about, ``Yes, it's me.''
   Homer: [through a megaphone] Yes, it's me.
   -- I own a mansion and a yacht, ``''
   
 Homer eventually talks Marge out of the car, and the two embrace.
 ``Cuff her, boys!'' yells Chief Wiggum.

 A mug shot of Marge is taken.  And of her hair.

 In a smoke-filled room, Mayor Quimby tells Chief Wiggum to let Marge
 go.  ``If Marge Simpson goes to jail, I can kiss the chick vote good-bye!''
 Threats are exchanged.
   
   I hereby declare today to be Marge Simpson Day in the city of Springfield!
   -- Mayor Quimby goes after the chick vote, ``''
   
 Apparently, Quimby won the war of nerves.

 Homer goes to sleep.  ``All's well that ends well.''  Marge is still
 upset.  She watches television and catches an advertisement for ``Rancho
 Relaxo'', Springfield's only two-star health spa.
   
   Swim, play tennis, or just sit and stare at the walls.
   -- Advertisement for Rancho Relaxo, ``''
   
 She shuts off the television and wakes Homer.  She says she needs a
 vacation.  Homer reminds her that the family just took a vacation.
   
   Marge: I need to unwind.
   Homer: I knw you do, Marge, but come on, you know what our vacations are
          like.  Those three monsters in the back seat.  ``Are we there yet?
          Are we there yet?''  And let's face it, I'm no day at the beach
          either.  ``Marge, can I have another sandwich?  Marge, can I have
          another sandwich?''
   -- In the comfort of your own home, ``''
   
 Marge explains that she meant by herself.  Homer fears a divorce, but
 Marge reassures him.

 Bart and Lisa are locked inside the station wagon, their noses pressed
 against the glass.  Marge thanks her sisters for taking care of the
 kids while she's gone.  ``We've got six months of maternity leave we're
 never going to use anyway.''  Homer comes out with Maggie, but once the
 baby spots her aunts, she grabs the door frame and doesn't let go.
 (``Wish &lt;I'd&gt; thought of that,'' notes Lisa.)  Homer tries to yank Maggie
 loose, with no success.  Marge suggests that since Maggie doesn't want to
 go, she should just stay home with Homer.  The twins express their
 reservations.
   
   For your information, I can take care of my...
   [Maggie loses her grip and falls]  Auugh!
   [picks up Maggie]  See?  Got her on the first bounce.
   -- A bouncing baby girl, ``''
   
 Homer (and Maggie) bid Marge farewell at the train station.

 At Rancho Relaxo...
   
   This is KOMA, WKOMA, restful easy listening.  Coming up next, a super
   set of songs about clouds...
   -- ``''
   
 Back at home, Homer hears a clattering.  It's Maggie, rattling her cup
 along the bars of her crib.  Maggie points at a picture of Marge.  Homer
 explains, ``Sorry, honey.  Mommy went crazy.''

 Bart and Lisa stare sickly at their lunch.
   
   Selma: Kids, you haven't touched your tongue sandwiches.
          You need something to drink?
   Patty: We've got clamato, Mr. Pibb and soy milk.
   -- ``''
   
   Lisa:  [yawns]  I think I'll just hit the hay.
   Selma: It's 12:30 in the afternoon!
   Lisa:  [quietly]  I'm aware of the time.
   -- Staying with Aunt Patty and Aunt Selma, ``''
   
 Selma tells Lisa she'll be sleeping with her; Bart will sleep with Patty.
 (``And I should warn you, I'm told I snore.'')  The twins leave to watch
 Divorce Court.
   
   Bart: I'm scared, Lisa.
   Lisa: You think &lt;you&gt; know fear?  Well, &lt;I've&gt; seen 'em naked!
   Bart: Waaaaauuuugh!
   -- Staying with Aunt Patty and Aunt Selma, ``''
   
 At Rancho Relaxo, Marge turns on the television set in her room.  It's
 a prepared videotape, hosted by none other than...
   
   I'm Troy McClure.  You might remember me from such movies as ``Today
   We Kill, Tomorrow We Die'' and ``Gladys the Groovy Mule''!
   -- ``''
   
   Troy: Our tour starts in your very own room, where Relaxo-Vision offers you
         the latest Hollywood hits.  And after midnight, the finest R-rated
         movies Europe has to offer!  [smacks his lips]  Today's selections are...
   Some other announcer:
         Thelma and Louise,
         The Happy Little Elves Meet Fuzzy Snuggleduck, and
         The Erotic Awakening of S.
   -- ``''
   
 The shameless promotion continues.  Troy pays a visit to the kitchen.
 Troy gets a massage.  Marge follows the instructions and dials for service.

 Back at home, Homer has trouble feeding Maggie.
   
   Homer:  Come on, Maggie.  Nummy-nummy-num!
   Maggie: [refuses to eat her baby food]
   Homer:  Aaaaahhh...  [eats some to demonstrate]
           Mmm...  [digging in]  Mmm...!
           [tries another jar]
           Mmm... strained peas.
   -- ``''
   
 Homer reclines on the couch, then gets up, revealing Maggie underneath him.

 Homer enlists the aid of a staple gun to change Maggie's diaper.

 Homer entertains Maggie with a puppet show, but SLH attacks the puppets
 (and Homer as well).  Maggie applauds.

 Back at Rancho Relaxo, Marge gets a massage.
   
   Marge, it's times like this I'm glad I flunked out of that Mexican med school.
   -- Gregory, the masseuse at Rancho Relaxo, ``''
   
 Barney pays Homer a visit, at Homer's request.  Barney spots the baby.
 ``Wow, if it isn't little Bart!''
   
   [picks up Maggie] Whoa!  Someone smells stinky!
   [sniffs himself]  Oh, it's me.
   -- Barney, bastion of cleanliness, ``''
   
 At bedtime, Bart rummages through Patty and Selma's closet.  ``I've said
 it before, and I'll say it again.''  Bart produces a bra.  ``Ay, Carumba!''
 He then shoots Lisa with what is later identified as a blackhead gun.
 (``Ewwww!'')   The twins return from their television-watching.
 ``Best MacGyver ever.''  ``Richard Dean Anderson will be in my dreams
 tonight.''  They turn in, and Selma proceeds to snore sickly.  Bart and
 Lisa remain wide awake.  And shudder.

 Marge curls up in bed, then realizes she has the entire bed to herself
 and stretches out.

 Homer tries to sing Maggie to sleep.
   
   [sung to Brahms' Lullaby]
   Go to sleep...
   And good night...
   La-la la la la la la...
   Dee-dee-dee...
   Dee-dee-dee...
   May your Christmas Days be bright!
   -- Homer sings Maggie to sleep, ``''
   
 ``Good night, my little pork chop.''  Maggie remains wide awake throughout.
 After Homer leaves, Maggie looks forlornly at a photo of Marge, climbs out
 of her crib, across the kitchen floor (and Barney).  Maggie crawls out the
 doggie door and spots something tall... and blue!   But it's a bush.
 Maggie continues onward down the street into the darkness...

 [End of Act Two.  Time: 14:58]

 (Reeboks are really, really cool.  So is a Game Boy.  And brush your teeth
  with Crest.  Watch pro wrestling.  Watch Married ... with Children.  Stay
  tuned for Drexel's Class.  Back to the show.)

 Homer comes into Maggie's room for her 9am feeding.  (It's 11:45.)
 But she's gone!  Home searches everywhere.  Barney announces that
 he's going to make a breakfast omelet.  But Homer wants him to help
 look for the baby.

 Barney thinks he's found Maggie, underneath the front stoop.  He pulls
 with all his might.  ``Barney, you're going to pull her arm off!''
 ``The sooner I get her out, the sooner we can have omelets!''  Barney
 finally wrests it free.  A water hose (spraying).

 Maggie wanders through the Springfield Mall.  She spots a tall, blue
 hairdo in the beauty salon...
   
   Hairdresser:  So, what's the verdict?
   Woman:        [realizes she's been given a Marge Simpson hairdo]
                 Oh, dear God!  I can't even put a bag over my head!
   Hairdresser:  Yes you can.
   -- ``''
   
 Disappointed, Maggie continues...

 Homer calls the Department of Missing Babies.  The hold music is
 ``Baby Come Back''.  Homer starts crying.

 At Rancho Relaxo, Marge goes down a checklist.  ``Bungee jumping,
 kayaking, calligraphy, cigar-making, hula dancing.  Hm, I guess
 I've done everything.''  She relaxes in a grass skirt and coconuts.
 The videotaped message continues.  Troy tells Marge that the next
 step is up to her.
   
   As I said to Dolores Montenegro in ``Calling All Quakers''...
   ``Have it &lt;your&gt; way, Baby!''
   -- Troy McClure, ``''
   
 Troy then hang-glides off a cliff.  Marge calls room service and orders
 a hot fudge sundae with whipped cream, and some chocolate-chip cheesecake,
 and a bottle of tequila.  Marge soaks in the tub (watching `Thelma and
 Louise'), takes a bite of her sundae, sinks underwater, and emerges,
 her hair down, completely relaxed.

 Homer pays a visit to Patty and Selma's apartment.  Bart and Lisa instant
 yell, ``Dad!'' and each clutch one of Homer's legs.  He asks the kids
 if they've seen Maggie.  They haven't, and Homer rushes off, leaving Bart
 and Lisa in the hallway.  Selma calls, ``Come on, kids!  It's time to rub
 Aunt Patty's feet!''  Lisa and Bart shudder.

 Maggie spots a shadow of a tall hairdo, but it's just a beefeater, trying
 hawk a lube job shop.

 Homer cries, then brightly answers the phone.  It's Marge, who says she
 feels much better.  Homer asks her how she'd feel if the dog ran away.
 Marge says, ``That's awful!''  Homer has some good news for her; the dog
 didn't run away.  Marge says she's coming home.  ``You can pick me up
 at the train station in an hour.  And bring the kids.  Bye.''

 Chief Wiggum talks through a megaphone.  ``Please!  Don't jump!  I know
 you're going through some tough times, but you have your whole life ahead
 of you!''  Pan across to show Maggie serenely asleep atop the roof of
 a Phineas Q. Butterfat shop, nestled next to the store mascot, which has
 a tall, blue, soft ice cream cone head.

 Homer tries to plan his excuse.
   
   Marge, Maggie was very young.  It's not like we got so attached to her...
   -- Homer practices his excuse for losing Maggie, ``''
   
 He answers the door.  It's Chief Wiggum.
   
   Wiggum: You the man who reported the lost baby?
   Homer:  Yes.
   Wiggum: Can you describe her?
   Homer:  Uh, she's small...  She's a girl...
   Wiggum: Bingo!  [produces Maggie]
   -- ``''
   
 Homer is thrilled, but Wiggum says he's wanted on three counts of criminal
 neglect.  Homer is so happy, he kisses Chief Wiggum.  Embarrassed, Wiggum
 responds, ``Aw, shucks.  Just don't do it again, you big lug.''

 Homer duct-tapes Maggie securely to the car seat, then picks up the
 older kids.  He walks out of the apartment, Bart and Lisa each clinging
 to one of Homer's legs.  He has to kick them into the back seat.
 (``Aaagh!''  ``Ungh!'')

 On the train, Marge looks at a wallet photo of her happy family, then
 compares it to a less-than-happy family which greets her.  They embrace her
 warmly (and all talk simultaneously).  Says Marge, ``I missed you, too.''

 In bed, Marge tells Homer that she wants him to help her a little around
 the house, and Homer gladly agrees.  Marge continues her requests, and
 Bart interrupts her.  Pull back.  The entire family is in bed together.
 Continues Bart, ``I think I speak for everyone in this bed when I say
 you have nothing to worry about.  Now let's try and get a little shut-eye,
 okay?''  Bart turns off the light, and everyone sighs and goes to sleep.
 Maggie blinks once.  Twice.  Then shuts her eyes.

 EPISODE TITLE: Bart the Lover


EPISODE SUMMARY: 

 The class is forced to watch one of those stupid educational films.
 Jimmy's car won't start because the battery is dead---one of the
 consequences of wishing for a world without zinc.  Nor can he
 phone Betty to tell her he's going to be late.  Distraught, Jimmy
 puts a gun to his head, but it doesn't fire---no zinc for the firing
 pin.  Jimmy then wakes up from his zincless nightmare.
   
   Thank goodness I still live in a world of telephones, car batteries,
   handguns [*bang*!] and many things made of zinc.
   -- Jimmy, a character in one of those stupid educational films,
      ``''
   
 ``Gross, he's picking his nose!'' exclaims Bart, casting a well-placed
 shadow.  The bell rings, and the kids rush out.
   
   If anyone wants to learn more about zinc, they're welcome to stay. ...
   We can talk about anything. ...  I'll do your homework for ya? ...
   -- Ms. Krabappel, alone again, ``''
   
 With a heavy sigh, she drives home, stopping at the Kwik-E-Mart.
   
   Mrs. Krabappel, I haven't seen you since we doubled our prices.
   -- Apu, ``''
   
 Ms. Krabappel buys a Scratch-N-Win, and doesn't.  Driving home, her
 car sputters.  The gas station attendant identifies sugar in the gas
 tank.  (``Your ex-husband strikes again.'')  She arrives home and spots
 the personal ads section in a magazine.  ``It might be fun, kind of a
 lark.''  She dials the number.  ``Come on, answer the phone...''  She
 slams her fist on the counter.  ``I need a man!''

 The students are gathered in the auditorium for an assembly.  Bart tosses
 a paper airplane which, just like your mother warned you, hits Todd in
 the eye.  Principal Skinner eventually gets everyone's attention and
 introduces Ted Carpenter from the Twirl King Yo-Yo Company, who in
 turn introduces Mr. Amazing, Sparkle, Zero-Gravity, and The Cobra, four
 teen-aged yo-yo-ers.  They have the entire student body mesmerized.
   
   Those guys must be millionaires!
   -- Bart is awed by a yo-yo demonstration, ``''
   
   I'll bet they get all kinds of girls!
   -- Nelson is awed by a yo-yo demonstration, ``''
   
 Ms. Hoover fails to see the educational value of the assembly, but
 Ms. Krabappel finds a typically cynical explanation.  The demonstration
 continues.  Afterwards, Lisa gets an autographed photo of Sparkle.
 ``Wait, this isn't you.''  ``That's the &lt;old&gt; Sparkle.''  The yo-yo-ers
 are herded into the van and scoot off.  (``Get your worthless butts
 in the van!  We got three more schools to do!'')

 The next day, every student has a yo-yo.  Some are better than others.
 Bart seems to have become quite an expert.  At home, Homer and Marge
 watch Bart play with his yo-yo.  (No, silly, I mean the toy.)
   
   Homer: Can you believe it!?  Pretty soon, I'll be able to quit my job and
          live off the boy!
   Marge: What?  Name me one person who's gotten rich by doing yo-yo tricks!
   Homer: [thinks]  Donald Trump? ... No.
          Arnold Palmer? ... No.
          Bill Cosby! ... No.
          [out loud]  D'oh!
   -- ``''
   
 In school...
   
   Ms.K:     [reading]  After two months at sea, the Pilgrims were running out
             of food and water.  [Nelson raises his hand]  Yes, Nelson.
   Nelson:   Did they have any have yo-yo's?
   Ms.K:     [exasperated] No, they did not have yo-yo's.
             [continues reading] When they landed at Plymouth Rock, they
             were greeted by the friendly Wampanog Indians.
   Milhouse: [raises his hand] Did the Indians have yo-yo's?
   Ms.K:     [snaps]  No, they did not have yo-yo's!
             [slams book closed]  That's it!
             [slams book onto her desk]  I am getting sick and tired of
             talking about yo-yo's.  From now on, I will not accept any book
             reports, science projects, dioramas, or anything else on yo-yo's
             or yo-yo-related topics.  Am I making myself clear?
   Bart:     Yo!
   -- Yo, mama.  ``''
   
   Milhouse: Hey Bart, got any new tricks for us today?
   Bart:     Just one.  A little something I call ``Plucking the Pickle''.
   -- ``''
   
 But the yo-yo crashes into the aquarium.  Pan from the yo-yo, down
 the string, to Bart's finger.
   
   I didn't do it.
   -- Bart, caught red-handed, ``''
   
 Groundskeeper Willy cleans the mess.
   
   Willy: Don't you worry about your wee fish, lass.  They're goin' to
          a better place.  [takes them out of the room]  [a toilet flushes]
   -- To that big fishtank in the sky, ``''
   
 Ms. Krabappel gives Bart one month's detention and confiscates the yo-yo.
   
   Ms.K: Bart, if I were you and you were me, would you give back the yo-yo?
   Bart: [imagines himself, yo-yo in hand.  Ms. Krabappel is inches tall]
         Here ya go.
   Ms.K: [jumps]
   Bart: [pulls it out if reach]  Just kidding.
         [drops the yo-yo] Here ya go.
   Ms.K: [jumps]
   Bart: [pulls it out if reach]  Just kidding.  Ha-ha-ha.
         [end of dream]
   Ms.K: Well, would you?
   Bart: Absolutely!
   -- ``''
   
 The yo-yo goes into Ms. Krabappel's desk, along with other confiscated items.

 Ms. Krabappel receives a response to her personal ad.  From Jasper.

 After class, Bart works under the sink, muttering, ``She'll pay for this.''
 He discovers the source of the clog---a Malibu Stacey doll head.
   
   Ms.H: Edna, Happy Hour in the teachers' lounge.
   Ms.K: Just a sec!  [scribbles `B' atop all the essays]
   -- There's a time for quality and a time for quantity, ``''
   
 After Ms. Krabappel leaves, Bart retrieves his yo-yo, and spots the
 personal ad.
   
   1 + 1 = 2?
   Recently divorced

          Box 402
   -- Ms. Krabappel's personal ad, ``''
   
 Bart discovers responses to the ad and puts 2 and 2 together.
 (Err, 1 and 1.)  He sets to work composing a reply.  ``My name is...''
 He looks around and spots a portrait of Woodrow Wilson.  ``... Woodrow.''

 Ms. Krabappel reads the response in her bedroom.  ``I like holding hands
 and dinner by candlelight.  And oh, yes.  I really hate yo-yo's.''  She
 collapses with joy on her bed.

 [End of Act One.  Time: 7:51]

 Marge looks out the kitchen window and spots SLH, shivering.  The dog
 tries to drink from his water bowl, but the water has frozen, and his
 tongue sticks to the dish.
   
   Marge: I bet we could buy a nice doghouse for $50.
   Homer: [sigh] Marge, you're a tool of doghouse makers.
   Marge: I am not!
   Homer: Yes, you are.  You've been brainwashed by all those doghouse
          commercials on TV.
   -- That's a load of rich creamery butter... ``''
   
   Homer: I'll build him a doghouse. [starts sketching]
   Marge: Oh, I don't know...
   Homer: Don't worry, I just drew up a little blueprint.
          Let me walk you through it.
          [shows his sketch, quality rivaling that of a 4-year-old]
          This is the door.  He goes through that. ... This is the roof. ...
          This happy character here is the sun.  He shines down on the house, see?
   -- The best-laid plans, ``''
   
 Bart comes in with the day's mail.
   
   How was detention today, dear?
   -- Marge's motherly concern, ``''
   
   I'm starting to get the hang of the floor-waxer.
   -- Bart returns from another day of detention, ``''
   
 One letter is addressed to ``Woodrow''.  Bart reads it in his room.
 ``You're not like the other men I've met.''  ``Yeah, I'm the twenty-eighth
 President of the United States.''  Ms. Krabappel invites Woodrow to
 write back and encloses a photo.
   
   You've got a date with the Xerox machine!
   -- Bart receives a sexy photo of Ms. Krabappel, ``''
   
 In the yard, Homer tries to saw wood for the doghouse, but fails as usual,
 swearing all the while.  Tood hears this from the Flanders' yard.

 At the Flanders' dinner table...
   
   A fella came into the store today and asked for change for a dollar?
   Well, sir, I gave him three quarters by mistake.  Took me the whole
   afternoon to track him down!
   -- Ned Flanders, ``''
   
   Maude: Todd, would you like some mixed vegetables?
   Todd:  Hell, no!
   Ned+Maude+Rod: [gasp!]
   Maude: What did you say?
   Todd:  I said I didn't want any damn vegetables.
   Ned:   All right, that's it, young man.  No Bible stories for you tonight!
   Todd:  [leaves, crying]
   Maude: [to Ned] Weren't you a little hard on him?
   Ned:   Well, you knew I had a temper when you married me.
   -- Dinner at the Flanders' house, ``''
   
 Rev. Lovejoy is about to dig into his chilled dessert.  Mrs. Lovejoy
 comes in, ``Ned Flanders is on the phone.''  Rev. Lovejoy mutters, ``Oh,
 if this about that stupid quarter again...''
   
   Rev.L: [reluctantly, to phone] Hello, Ned.
   Ned:   Sorry to bother you, Rev. Lovejoy, but I'm kind of in a tizzy.
          My son Todd just told us he didn't want to eat his damn vegetables.
   Rev.L: Well, you know kids and vegetables.  What was it?  Asparagus?
   Ned:   No, no, Reverend, the point is, he said a `bad word'!
   Rev.L: [realizes]  Oh, oh, right, yeah.
          Well, kids usually pick these things stuff up from &lt;someplace&gt;.
          Find out who's doing it and... direct them to the Bible.
   Ned:   &lt;Where&gt; in the Bible?
   Rev.L: Uh... Page 900. [quickly hangs up]
   Ned:   But Rever--- [click]
   Rev.L: [looks down at his dessert, which has melted]  Damn Flanders.

 Bart pays Lisa a visit.
   
   Bart: Hey, Lis.  A moment of your time.
   Lisa: [stops playing her sax] Yeah?
   Bart: Suppose I was writing my &lt;second&gt; letter to a girl, and I already
         used up my A-material.  What should I say?
   Lisa: [teasing]  Ooooh, could it be there's a special someone you're not
         telling me about?  [puts down he sax, bats her eyelashes coyly]
   Bart: Oh, please.
   Lisa: Is it Sherri?
   Bart: No.
   Lisa: Is it Terri?
   Bart: No!
   Lisa: Is it that girl with the lazy eyepatch?
   Bart: No!
   Lisa: Is it that exchange student, M!pa?
   Bart: No!!  It's &lt;not&gt; for me.  It's... homework.
   Lisa: Sure it is.
         Hey Bart, [teasing, makes goo-goo eyes] let's do some homework!

 At the Flanders' residece...
   
   Todd:  [watches `Gomer Pyle' on television]
   Ned:   Is this &lt;all&gt; he watches?
   Maude: Well, he used to watch `Davey and Goliath', but he thought the idea
          of a talking dog was blasphemous.
   -- The House of the Lord, ``''
   
 Ned scratches out another potential bad influence on Todd.

 While Marge collects the laundry, Bart asks if she saved Homer's love
 letters.  She did, of course, although there's only one.  And it's really
 a postcard from Duff Brewery.  Bart reads it as Homer v.o.'s.
   
   [sloppily scrawled]
   Maybe it's the beer talking Marge but you got a butt that won't quit.
   they got those big chewy pretzels here merJanthfgrr five dollars??!!!?
   get outta here [scrawl]
   -- Homer's single love letter (postcard) to Marge, ``''
   
 Bart spit-cleans Ms. Krabappel's coffee mug and asks what's troubling her.
 She muses how she wishes she could meet a man who likes the way she looks
 in the morning, laughs at her jokes, can fix her car...

 In his room, Bart composes his reply.
   
   Dear Edna,
   Your photo took my breath away.  Truly yours is a butt that won't quit.
   Yesterday morning, I put your picture up in my garage to inspire me while
   I gapped my spark plugs.
   -- Bart's second letter to Ms. Krabappel, ``''
   
 Ms. Krabappel submerges in her bubble bath in ecstasy.

 Rod and Todd play.
   
   Rod:  At last we built the mission.
   Todd: Finally, the villagers have a place to pray.
   Rod:  [sings] Bringing in the sheaves!
   Todd: [sings] Bringing in the sheaves!
   Rod+Todd: We shall come rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves!
   -- ``''
   
 Ned scratches out ``brother'' from his list of possible bad influences.
 From the next yard comes Homer's swearing as he fights with the doghouse.
   
   Ned:   Homer, I'm afriad I've got a bone to pick with you.
   Homer: Look, if it's about the camcorder, I &lt;lost&gt; it, okay?
   -- ``''
   
   Ned:   I'm talking about your, heh heh, potty-mouth.
   Homer: What the hell are you talking about?
   -- ``''
   
   All of us pull a few `boners' now and then, go off `half-cocked', make
   `asses' of ourselves.  I don't want to be `hard on' you...
   -- Ned Flanders talks to Homer about his foul language, ``''
   
   Ned:   I just wish you wouldn't curse in front of my boy.
   Homer: Oh, come on, Flanders.  I don't complain about your... ...
          moustache!
   Ned:   What's wrong with my moustache?
   Homer: Makes it look like you got something to hide.
   Ned:   What!?
   Homer: [privately] People are talking...  Lots of people.
   -- ``''
   
 Ned makes a deal.  He'll shave the ``ol' soup strainer'' if Homer gives
 the sailor talk the heave-ho.  Homer agrees.  ``Aye-aye! ... [sotto]
 Admiral Butt-head.''

 Bart watches ``Colorization Theater'' (all the colors are way off) and
 picks up some more useful phrases for his letters to Ms. Krabappel.

 Ms. Krabappel shows Ms. Hoover her latest letter.  She'll ask for a photo,
 and ``If he's got everything where it should be, I'm reeling him in!''
 Bart opens ``NHL Stars of 1950'', flips to Gordie Howe and snip out the
 photo, saying, ``Strap on your skates, Gordie.  You're going in.''

 That evening...
   
   Homer: Hey, Marge.  You wanna hear something funny?  Flanders thinks I
          swear too much!  Hee-hee!  ... Marge, you're not laughing.
   Marge: Well, you know, maybe he's right.
   Homer: Well, what a surprise!  Marge sticks up for Flanders!
          Can we have &lt;one&gt; conversation where you don't bring up your hero,
          Ned Flanders?
   Marge: Actually, Homer, &lt;you&gt; brought up Ned Flan---
   Homer: Look, we're past that.
   -- ``''
   
   When my father got out of the Navy, he cursed a blue streak.
   It nearly cost him his job as a baby photographer.
   -- Marge talks to Homer about his swearing, ``''
   
 Marge suggests Homer start a ``Swear Jar'', contributing 25 cents for each
 offense.  Homer agrees, but asks lots of questions to set the ground rules.

 In the treehouse, Bart reads Ms. Krabappel's response, suggesting they meet
 for dinner, then return to her apartment ``for some home cookin'.''  Bart
 is puzzled at first, then says, ``Aye Carumba!''  Bart has had his fun.
 ``Time to boat this bass.''
   
   Ms.K: [writing]  When I read your letters, I feel as if you are right here
         watching me.
         [looks up, Bart is watching her]
   -- ``''
   
 Bart composes his reply, inviting Ms. Krabappel to dinner at the Gilded
 Truffle.  Ms. Krabappel tries on a large assortment of dresses (ranging
 from cute polka dots to slinky to leather).

 Bart chuckles at seeing Ms. Krabappel waiting at the Gilded Truffle,
 then leaves to enjoy the movie next door.  After the movie is over, he
 spots Ms. Krabappel still waiting, and crying.
   
   I can't help but feel partly responsible.
   -- Bart, completely responsible, ``''
   
 [End of Act Two.  Time: 16:16]

 In church, Homer accidentally puts a $20 bill in the collection tray.
 ``Da--''.  (*clink*) go the coins into the jar.  At the bowling alley,
 the last pin won't go down.  ``Oh, you son-of-a---'' (*clink*).
 Ned, having shaved off his moustache, was immediately cast in a commercial.
 ``The way these checks keep coming in is almost criminal!''  Homer yells,
 ``You dirty bast---'' (*clink*)  Homer completes the doghouse.  Lisa asks
 where the door is.  ``Ohhh---'' (*clink*)  While Homer reclines in the
 hammock, a beehive falls on his stomach.  Homer's bee-sting-covered hand
 drops more coins into the quickly-filling jar.

 At detention, Bart tries to tell Ms. Krabappel there are millions of other
 men.  She challenges him to name one.  Principal Skinner?  ``Let's just
 say his Mommy won't let him out to play.''  Coach Fortner is an alcoholic.
 As for Groundskeeper Willie, ``I'm not going to &lt;tell&gt; what that guy's
 into.''
   
   Bart, you're the closest thing to a man in my life.
   And that's so depressing, I think I'm going to cry.
   [she cries]
   -- Ms. Krabappel, dumped again, ``''
   
 In the yard, Homer hits his thumb with a hammer, but says, ``Oh, fudge.''
 Upon stepping on a nail, ``Fiddle-dee-dee.  That will require a tetanus
 shot.''  Fed up, he kicks the doghouse down.  Marge and Lisa wheel in a
 brand new doghouse they bought, more than paid for by the money in the
 swear jar.  And there's also a little surprise.
   
   Gasp!  Beer!  How did you know!
   -- Homer receives a surprise gift, ``''
   
 Inside, Marge plays peek-a-boo with Maggie.  Bart comes in.  ``Mom, this is
 a little ahead of schedule, but... I need help with my love life.''  Lisa
 responds, ``I knew it!''

 Bart shows the photo of Ms. Krabappel he received.
   
   This is your teacher!?  I should start going to Parents' Night.  [growls]
   -- Homer sees Bart's photo of a sexy Ms. Krabappel, ``''
   
   Homer: Boy, you've got to go to your teacher and tell her the truth!
   Marge: No, Homer, the truth will humiliate her!
   Homer: Oh, Marge, I only said it because I thought that's what you wanted
          to hear!
   -- The secret to a long-lasting marriage, ``''
   
 Lisa suggests they write another letter, saying good-bye without hurting
 her feelings.
   
   Step aside!  Sensitive love letters are my specialty!
   -- Homer offers to help Bart write a love letter, ``''
   
   Dear Baby,
   Welcome to Dumpville.  Population---You.
   -- Homer helps Bart write a letter, ``''
   
 Time passes, and various attempts to write a letter are proposed and shot
 down.
   
   Bart:  How about, ``Crocodiles bit off my face.''
   Marge: That's disgusting!  And besides, when a woman lives a man, it
          doesn't matter that a crocodiles bit off his face.
   Homer: I may hold you to that, Marge.
   -- ``''
   
   Three simple words:  I am gay.
   -- Homer helps Bart write a letter, ``''
   
 The family seem to have settled on a reply, but Homer wants to add,
 ``(P.S., I am gay.)''  But he &lt;does&gt; come up with a touching concluding
 sentence.

 Ms. Krabappel sits glumly in her apartment.  Bart slips a note under her
 door and scoots away.  ``Dearest Edna, I must leave you.  Why I cannot
 say.  Where I am going you cannot know.  How I will get there I haven't
 decided yet.  But one thing I can tell you, any time I hear the wind
 blow it will whisper the name... Edna.  And so let us part with a love that
 will echo through the ages. -- Woodrow.''

 Ms. Krabappel hums cheerfully to herself and looks out the window of the
 classroom as Bart scrubs the floor with a toothbrush.  ``It's such a nice
 day today, let's have detention outside.''  ``It's a date.''  Bart offers
 his arm, Ms. Krabappel takes it, and they walk into the sunshine.

 Pan over to the photo mounted on Ms. Krabappel's desk, as Gordie Howe's
 stats are overlaid.

 EPISODE TITLE: Homer at the Bat


EPISODE SUMMARY: 

 At the plant, Homer digs into the donuts, eating a half dozen in rapid
 succession.
   
   Homer: [scarfing down donuts]
   Lenny: Hey, Homer, slow down.  You're going to choke or something.
   Homer: Don't tell me how to eat donuts!  [starts choking]
   Karl:  [matter-of-factly] Hey, Homer's choking again.
   Lenny: Isn't there a first-aid chart around here somewhere?
   Karl:  Somebody scare him.
   Charlie: That's for the hiccups!
   -- Remain calm, dough-nut panic, ``''
   
 Lenny looks at the company bulletin board, on which is a Heimlich Maneuver
 poster.  ``Hey, look at this!''  But he was referring to the softball team
 sign-up sheet.  Homer finally dislodges the donut and eagerly signs up.
 He invites the others to sign up as well, but they don't share his
 enthusiasm.
   
   Lenny: Homer, last year, we were 2 and 28.
   Homer: Look, I know it wasn't our best season...
   Lenny: Actually, it was.
   -- Room for improvement, ``''
   
 Homer tells them that this year will be different.  He has a secret weapon.
 The other employees muse about what this weapon could possibly be...
 Charlie imagines that Homer has a giant glove.  Karl imagines Homer
 is able to sproing from base to base.  Lenny imagines Homer having a
 death ray, with which he incinerates the opposition.  Everybody signs
 up eagerly.

 In the Simpsons garage...
   
   Homer: Come here, boy, I want to show you something.
   Bart:  What's that, a homemade bat?
   Homer: It's something very special.  A homemade bat.
   -- A Homer-made bat, ``''
   
 Homer explains...
   
   It all started last year during a terrible thunderstorm, when I locked
   myself out of the house.  Shelving myself with a large piece of sheet metal,
   I ran for cover under the tallest tree I could find!
   -- Homer Simpson, Safety Inspector, ``''
   
 A bolt of lightning strikes the tree, and a large branch falls to the
 ground, the point at which it had been joined to the tree still glowing.
 ``Something told me this was a very special, very magical piece of wood...
 that I could make a bat out of.''  Putting his homemade football on hold,
 Homer sets to work planing, sawing, nailing (?), and acetylene torching (!)
 the branch.
   
   Homer: [working to build a baseball bat in the garage]
   Marge: Homey, come to bed.
          [scene change:  Marge is in bed, as wood shavings flick onto her
           from Homer's woodwork in bed]
          Homer, go back to the garage.
   -- Yessss, master, ``''
   
 Homer shows Bart the bat.
   
   Bart:  [sees Homer's homemade bat]  Wow!  How many home runs you gonna
          hit with that?
   Homer: Let's see.  We play thirty games.  Ten at-bats a game.  Mmm...
          Three thousand.
   -- Back-of-the-envelope calculations, ``''
   
 At the softball field, the police force team faces the nuclear power plant
 team.  After some warm-up, the umpire briefs the teams on the ground rules.
   
   Umpire: Okay, let's go over the ground rules.
           You can't leave first until you chug a beer.
           Any man scoring has to chug a beer.
           You have to chug a beer at the top of all odd-numbered innings.
           Oh, and the fourth inning is the beer inning.
   Chief Wiggum:  [in baseball uniform]  Hey, we know how to play softball.
   -- The canonical softball drinking game, ``''
   
 The field is set...
   
   Umpire: Play ball!
   Chief Wiggum: [steps to the plate]
   Police radio: Attention all units!  Attention all units!
           Armored car being robbed at 59th and...
   Chief Wiggum: Turn off that damn radio!
   -- Please arrange to have your car robbed only during normal business hours,
      ``''
   
 Marge and the kids are in the stands watching the game.  Marge has a
 video camcorder (borrowed from Ned, no doubt) and narrates the game.
   
   And the man wants to hit the ball, too.  [crack!]  And he does.
   And there he goes, off in that direction.  And everyone is happy.
   -- Marge Simpson does the play-by-play, ``''
   
 Despite Bart's offer to help, Marge maintains that she can handle the
 play-by-play herself.  The police team hit a homer run and shoot their
 guns in celebration.  (``Hey, stop that!'' scolds Chief Wiggum.)

 The game is in the bottom of the ninth, two out, the police up 5 to 2,
 the bases are loaded, and it's Homer turn at bat.  It's secret weapon
 time, but when his teammates see that it's his magic bat, they take the
 opportunity to make fun of it.  (``And I have an enchanted jockstrap,''
 kids Karl.)

 Homer steps to the plate, and it's a homer for Homer.  (The ball sails
 past the fence to a picnic area, striking a man on his head as he is
 about to eat a sandwich.)  Homer taunts the losing team.  (``Ha ha,
 cops can't win!''  ``Get his licence and registration,'' orders Chief
 Wiggum.)

 At home, Homer reviews the videotape as Bart and Lisa admire.
   
   Lisa:  Wow, Dad!
   Bart:  Homer, can I get you a beer?
   Lisa:  No, &lt;I&gt; want to get him a beer.
   Homer: Kids, kids, kids!  You can &lt;each&gt; get me a beer.
   -- Beer and beer alike, ``''
   
 But first, Homer re-watches the game-winning hit in super-slow-motion.
 (His ample belly provides considerable jiggle.)

 The nuclear plant team plays against several other opponents, and Homer's
 enchanted bat continues its magic.  The other players on the team
 have their own `magic bats', made from such curious objects as a piano leg
 and a wooden leg.

 At the Millionaire's Club atop the Springfield Trade Center, Smithers
 informs Burns of the team's success; they need only defeat Shelbyville
 next week to capture the pennant.  Burns' lunch companion is Ari
 Amodopoulos, who challenges Burns' confidence in his team.
   
   Ari:   Would you care to bet a million dollars on that?
   Burns: Oh, if we're going to bet, why don't we make it interesting!
   Ari:   What, a million dollars isn't interesting to you?
   Burns: Oh, did you say a million?  I'm, I'm sorry, my mind was elsewhere.
          I thought you would start with a small amount, then we would
          bait each other, and, well, you know how it goes.
          Yes, certainly, a million would be fine.  [handshake]
   -- But gambling is illegal in 48 states... ``''
   
 [End of Act One]

 In Burns' office...
   
   Burns:    Smithers, I've been thinking.  Is it wrong to cheat to win
             a million-dollar bet?
   Smithers: Yes, sir.
   Burns:    Let me rephrase that.  Is it wrong if &lt;I&gt; cheat to win a
             million-dollar bet?
   Smithers: No, sir.  Who would you like killed?
   -- Burns remembers to phrase it as an ethical question, ``''
   
 Burns had in mind hiring ringers for the team.  He unveils a
 chart of a baseball diamond, with names like Honus Wagner and
 Mordecai ``Three-Finger'' Brown.  Smithers points out that all of the
 plays have retired, and are long dead.  (``In fact, your right fielder
 has been dead for 130 years.'')  So Burns sends Smithers out to scour
 the American, National, and Negro Leagues to find players.  He has 24 hours.

 At an autograph session...
   
   Smithers: [whispers in Jose Canseco's ear]
   Jose:     I get $50,000 to play one game?
   Smithers: That's right, Mr. Canseco.
   Jose:     Well, it's a pay cut, but what the hey.  It sounds like fun.
   -- For love of money, ``''
   
 Smithers scrambles through the woods and narrowly escapes being shot at.
   
   Smithers: [in the woods, a bullet grazes his shoulder]
   Hunter:   Hey, sorry.  I thought you were a deer.
   Smithers: Heh heh, that's okay.  Happens all the time.
   -- ``''
   
 The hunter is none other than Mike Scioscia, who muses that he sometimes
 wishes he were doing something a little more blue-collar, ``with big
 machines and cool dials and stuff.  Like an oil refinery, or hydro-electric
 plant.''

 At Graceland, the tour guide shows Elvis's three television sets.
 There, Smithers approaches Ozzie Smith.

 Smithers rings a doorbell, and the door is answered by Don Mattingly,
 who was doing the dishes.  Mattingly eagerly invites Smithers in.

 Smithers invites Steve Sax, who was performing with the Steve Sax Trio.

 At a company meeting, Burns introduces security guard Roger Clemens,
 janitor Wade Boggs, lunchroom cashier Ken Griffey, Jr., and Steve Sax,
 Don Mattingly, Darryl Strawberry, Ozzie Smith, Mike Scioscia, and Jose
 Canseco (for whom he'll make up jobs later).  The employees are
 impressed until they realize that the players are joining the softball
 team.  Lenny complains, ``Mr. Burns, with them on the team, you won't
 need us!''  Burns replies, ``Well, DUH!''

 Burns orders Scioscia to sign up, but Mike is excited about working the
 solid contaminant encapsulator.  ``One more outburst like that and I'll
 send you back to the big leagues.''
   
   Homer:  You're Darryl Strawberry.
   Darryl: Yes?
   Homer:  You play right field.
   Darryl: Yes?
   Homer:  I play right field, too.
   Darryl: So?
   Homer:  Well, are you better than me?
   Darryl: Well, I never met you... but... Yes.
   -- Any questions? ``''
   
 At dinner, Homer grouses that the whole team worked hard to reach the
 championship game, only to be replaced.  Meanwhile, Maggie feeds her
 Brussel sprouts to SLH.
   
   Marge: What makes you think this Darryl Strawberry character is better
          than you?
   Homer: Marge, forget it.  He's bigger than me, faster than me, stronger
          than me, and he already has more friends around the plant than I do.
   Bart:  You make me sick, Homer.  You're the one who told me I could do
          anything if I just put my mind to it!
   Homer: Well, now that you're a little bit older, I can tell you that's
          a crock!  No matter how good you are at something, there's always
          about a million people better than you.
   Bart:  Gotcha.  Can't win, don't try.
   -- Lesson for the day, ``''
   
 The team is on the field for practice.  Burns is wearing an old-style
 uniform with ``Zephyrs'' on the front.  He lectures the players that
 they all have to earn their spot on the team.  And rather than beer,
 they are instead to drink a special nerve tonic which promotes health
 (though has also been known to cause gigantism, but only in rare cases).
 Ken Griffey, Jr. takes a sip and is hooked.  Time for the training to
 begin, and all groan when Smithers brings out the medicine balls.

 In the training room, everybody is working out, except for Homer, who
 is in one of those steam reducing gizmos.

 At the plate, Burns demonstrates how to bunt.  But when the ball hits
 the bat, Burns goes sailing into the backstop.
   
   Smithers: What are you going to do with the million dollars, sir?
   Burns:    Oh, I dunno.  Throw it on the pile, I suppose.
   -- Burns has bet $1 million on the softball team, ``''
   
 To help seal the victory, Burns hires a hypnotist.
   
   Hynpotist: You are all very good players...
   Team:      [entranced] We are all very good players...
   Hypnotist: You will beat Shelbyville...
   Team:      We will beat Shelbyville...
   Hypnotist: You will give one hundred and ten percent...
   Team:      That's impossible.  No one can give more than one hundred percent.
              By definition that is the most anyone can give...
   -- You own a mansion and a yacht...  ``''
   
 Back in the field, a fly ball is hit to Homer, but Darryl Strawberry
 leaps upwards out of frame to catch the ball.  When Homer complains,
 Darryl says to Burns, ``Some of these players have a bad attitude, Skip.''

 At the plant...
   
   Mike Scioscia: [pushing a wheelbarrow of glowing green goop]
   Karl:  [pulls up beside him with his own wheelbarrow of glowing green goop]
          Hey, Scioscia.  I don't get it.  You're a ringer, but you're here every
          night in the core, busting your butt hauling radioactive waste.
   Mike Scioscia: Well, Karl, it's such a relief from the pressures of playing
          big-league ball.  I mean, there, you make any kind of mistake, and
          boom, the press is all over you.  [accidentally spills his goop]
          Uh oh...
   Karl:  Ah, don't worry about it.
   Mike Scioscia: Oh man, is this ever sweet...
   -- ``''
   
 Bart and Ralph are choosing up sides for a pick-up baseball game.  Ken
 Griffey, Jr. stops by, and Ralph chooses him.  Bart, annoyed, chooses
 Milhouse.  Wade Boggs comes past, and Ralph picks him.  Bart reluctantly
 chooses Lewis.  Ralph chooses Jose Canseco.  (``D'oh!'')

 Burns orders Mattingly to get rid of his sideburns.  Curiously, Mattingly
 isn't wearing sideburns at all.

 Homer steps to the plate with WonderBat.  Roger Clemens throws the ball
 so fast, it burns Homer's bat in two.

 It's the day before the game, and Burns gives his team some final advice.
 (Darryl Strawberry chimes in sycophantically.)
   
   Now, before I post the starting line-up, I want to assure those of you
   whose names are not on the list... that I'm very disappointed in you.
   -- Monty Burns, softball team manager, ``''
   
   Homer: Please please please, I want to make the team.  [catches Roger Clemens]
          Clemens, did I make the team?
   Roger: You sure did!
   Homer: I did!  Woo-hoo!  Woo-hoo!  In your face, Strawberry!
   Roger: Wait a minute, are you Ken Griffey, Jr.?
   Homer: No.
   Roger: Sorry.  Didn't mean to get your hopes up.
   -- ``''
   
 [End of Act Two]

 In his office, Burns gloats that there's no way he could lose his bet.
 ``Unless, of course, my nine all-stars fall victim to nine separate
 misfortunes and are unable to play tomorrow.  But that will never happen.
 Three misfortunes, that's possible.  Seven misfortunates, there's an
 outside chance.  But nine misfortunes?  I'd like to see that!''

 His wish is the writer's command.

 Steve Sax is pulled over by the two cops.  When they see that he's from
 New York City, the haul him into jail, since there's an unsolved murder
 in the Big Apple.

 Mike Scioscia lies in a hospital bed, a nearby Geiger counter clicking away.
   
   Dr. Hibbert:  Uh, Mike, try to lift your arm.
   Mike Scioscia: Can't... lift... arm... or... speak... at... normal... rate...
   -- ``''
   
 Thanks to acute radiation poisoning, he's out of the game.  Ken Griffey,
 Jr. is wheeled in, his head swollen to gargantuan proportions, thanks to
 the nerve tonic.

 Jose Canseco is walking down the street when he passes a burning house.
 The woman outside pleads for him to rescue her baby.  Being the kind,
 generous soul that he is, Jose rushes into the burning house and emerges
 with the child.  She then hears her cat, and Jose rescues it as well.
 She hears her player piano.  Jose pulls up his collar and heads back in
 again.

 In bed...
   
   Homer: Oh, one thing I'm good at and I can't do it any more.
   Marge: Homey, you're good at lots of things.
   Homer: Like what?
   Marge: Like snuggling?  [snuggles up to him]
   Homer: Yeah.  but none of my friends can watch me.
   -- It's an indoor sport, ``''
   
 At Moe's Tavern...
   
   Barney: And I say, England's greatest Prime Minister was Lord Palmerston!
   Wade Boggs: Pitt the Elder!!
   Barney: Lord Palmerston!!!
   Wade Boggs: Pitt the Elder!!!!  [pokes Barney]
   Barney: Okay, you asked for it, bud!  [punches him out]
   Moe:    Yeah, that's showing him, Barney!  [scoffing]  Pitt the Elder...
   Barney: Lord Palmerston!!!! [punches Moe]
   -- ``''
   
 Chief Wiggum congratulates his boys.  ``I think we can close the book on
 every unsolved crime in our fair city.''  Sax asks to call his lawyer.
 ``You watch too many movies, Sax.''

 Ozzie Smith pays a visit to the ``Springfield Mystery Spot''.
 He buys a ticket and goes in.  We hear a falling scream.

 At the Simpsons house...
   
   Homer: Where do you think you're going?
   Lisa:  To the game.
   Homer: No no no.  I don't want you to see me sit on my worthless butt.
   Bart:  We've seen it, Dad.
   -- ``''
   
 Burns again tells Mattingly to get rid of his sideburns.  Mattingly tries
 to explain that he isn't wearing sideburns, but Monty won't hear anything
 of it and sends him off.  Smithers gives Burns the reports on the missing
 players.  Ozzie Smith is still falling.  (He takes a snapshot on the way
 down.)  Jose Canseco is still rescuing household appliances from the
 burning house.  (``The dryer goes on the right.'')  Roger Clemens thinks
 he's a chicken.  Burns threatens the hypnotist, who merely pulls out
 his watch.  (``But I did a &lt;good&gt; job... a &lt;good&gt; job...'')  Burns is won
 over.  Mattingly arrives, his sideburns shaved up almost to the top of his
 head.  But Monty isn't impressed.  ``I thought I told you to trim those
 sideburns!''  He throws him off the team.  (Says Mattingly to himself,
 ``I still like him better than Steinbrenner.'')  Monty gives an inspiring
 non-speech to his players, who rush onto the field.  All except Homer, since
 Darryl Strawberry is suited up for the game.

 Lisa and Bart taunt Strawberry with the infamous ``Darryl...'' chant.
 Marge scolds the kids, but Lisa explains that they're professional athletes,
 ``It rolls right off their backs.''  Darryl Strawberry sheds a tear.

 The peanuts vendor appears and throws his wares haphazardly about.  One
 bag land on the field, another in the parking lot.

 Monty asks Smithers to massage his brain when he realizes that it's his
 managerial skills which will have to save the day.  He orders Strawberry
 to hit a home run.  And he does.  (``I told him to do that.'')

 Marge videotapes Homer on the bench, but when Homer reaches down to scratch
 himself in that place baseball players (and Roseanne Arnold) always
 scratch themselves, Marge quickly turns the camera away.  ``Children, tell
 me when your father stops scratching himself.''  Time passes.  ``Kids?''
 Bart replies, ``We'll tell you, Mom.''

 The game is tied, it's the bottom of the ninth, the bases are loaded,
 there are two outs, and Strawberry is due to bat.  Even though Darryl
 has hit nine home runs, Burns sends him to the showers because Strawberry
 and the pitcher are both left-handed.  (``It's called playing the
 percentages.'')  He sends Homer, a righty, to the plate instead.  Burns
 reviews the signals with Homer.  Burns' explanation goes on and on, and
 Homer's mind wanders.  ``I wish I was home with a big bag of potato
 chips.  Mmm... potato chips...''

 Homer steps to the plate.  Marge and the kids cheer.  Everyone else boos.
 Monty goes into a totally bizarre sequence of signs from the third base
 coach's box, and while Homer merely stares, confused, the pitch hits him
 in the head, knocking him unconscious.  But the good news, is that by
 getting hit by the pitch, Homer wins the game.  ``I guess he'll be happy
 when he comes to,'' notes Marge.  The runner from third has to push
 Homer's body aside to step on the plate.  The team carry Homer's unconscious
 body off the field on their shoulders.

 Everybody is gathered together for a team picture.

 [End of Act Three]

 The scene, a baseball stadium.  The picture fades to black-and-white, and
 acquires the streaks and graininess of an old movie.  Terry Cashman sings
 ``Talkin' Baseball'', but with new lyrics suited to the episode.

 Instead of ``Shhh...'', we hear the crack of a bat.
 The Gracie theme is played by a stadium organ.

 The Twentieth Century Fox logo is unchanged.

 EPISODE TITLE: Separate Vocations


EPISODE SUMMARY: 

 Springfield Elementary School.  Ms. Krabappel begins, ``Now class, I
 promised you a surprise today...''  Milhouse imagines a native American
 wrestling an alligator.  Sherry imagines a Happy Little Elf giving out
 ice-cream cones.  Bart imagines Ms. Krabappel removing the skin from
 her face, revealing her true self to be a purple two-horned alien.
 ``I knew it!''  But the surprise is that they're going to take a test.
 The kids groan.

 The reaction in Miss Hoover's class is slightly different.  Lisa cheers,
 ``All right!  A test!''  It's the Career Aptitude Normalizing Test (CANT).
   
   Some of you may discover a wonderful vocation you never even imagined.
   Others may find out that life isn't fair... [turning bitter] in spite
   of your Masters from Bryn Mawr, you might end up a glorified babysitter
   to a bunch of dead-eyed fourth-graders while your husband runs naked
   on a beach with your marriage counselor!!  [stares from the students]
   Ahem.
   -- Ms. Krabappel administers the Career Aptitude Normalizing Test (CANT),
      ``''
   
   First question.  If I could be any animal, I would be (a) a carpenter ant,
   (b) a nurse shark, or (c) a lawyer bird.
   -- Ms. Krabappel administers the Career Aptitude Normalizing Test (CANT),
      ``''
   
 Bart answers (c).
   
   Question sixty.  I prefer the smell of (a) gasoline, (b) French fries, or
   (c) bank customers.
   -- Miss Hoover administers the Career Aptitude Normalizing Test (CANT),
      ``''
   
 Lisa answers (c).

 The test is over.
   
   Janey: Well, that was a waste of time.
   Lisa:  Janey, school is &lt;never&gt; a waste of time.
   Ms.H:  Since we have fifteen minute until recess, please put down your
          pencils and stare at the front of the room.
   -- Time well-spent, ``''
   
 Some time later, two uniformed guards come into the classroom and pick
 up the tests, placing them into a satchel which is handcuffed to one
 guard's wrist.

 The tests are flown to Iowa Non-International Airport and rushed to the
 testing center for computerized grading.  When the machine gets to Bart's
 form, it gags.

 J. Loren Pryor gives the students their scientifically-selected career
 results individually.  Janey: architect.  Boy: insurance salesman.
 Ralph: salmon gutter.  Milhouse: military strong-man.
 Martin: systems analyst (his wish come true).  Lisa: homemaker.
 (``It's like a Mommy,'' Dr. Pryor explains.)
   
   Bart: Police officer!?  Well I'll be jiggered!
   Dr.J: Heh heh heh.  If you'd like to learn more, I could arrange for
         you to ride along in a police car for a night.
   Bart: Hey, I don't need you to get me in the back of a police car.
   -- Bart reads his scientifically-selected career, ``''
   
 Dr. Pryor admits that he had Bart pegged as a drifter.  Bart daydreams
 a bit on that.  (``Cool.'')

 At the dinner table, Lisa complains, ``A homemaker?  I might as well be
 dead!''
   
   Homer: So what are &lt;you&gt; going to be, boy?
   Bart:  Policeman.
   Homer: [gags on his food]
   -- Bart's scientifically-selected career, ``''
   
   Marge: You know, your father wanted to be a policeman for a little while,
          but they said he was too heavy.
   Homer: No, the Army said I was too heavy.  The police said I was too dumb.
   -- ``''
   
   Lisa:  Well, &lt;I'm&gt; going to be a famous jazz musician.  I've got it all
          figured out.  I'll be unappreciated in my own country, but my
          gutsy blues stylings will electrify the French.  I'll avoid the
          horrors of drug abuse, but I do plan to have several torrid love
          affairs, and I may or may not die young.  I haven't decided.
   Marge: Honey, if that's what you want, we'll do anything we can to help.
   -- Is she accepting applications for torrid love affairs?
      ``''
   
 Homer interrupts, ``Wait a minute.  Isn't anybody going to follow in
 &lt;my&gt; footsteps?''  Everybody else at the table (Maggie included) quickly
 looks away, pretending not to have heard.  A coyote howls in the distance.

 Marge takes Lisa to a music school.  Lisa demonstrates her ability to
 the teacher, who is impressed.
   
   I'll be frank with you Lisa, and when I say frank, I mean,
   you know, devastating.
   -- Instructor at music school, ``''
   
 Unfortunately, Lisa inherited stubby fingers from her father.  Lisa
 protests, then realizes, ``My God, they &lt;are&gt; stubby...''

 Homer answers the door.  It's the two cops.  Homer nervously tries to
 explain, ``I didn't steal that copper wire, I just thought they were
 throwing it out.''  But that's not the reason for their visit.  They
 came to let Bart ride with them.  Homer lets Bart go.  ``Maybe this'll
 straighten the boy out.''
   
   Bart:  Wow!  Can I see your club?
   Cop:   It's called a baton, son.
   Bart:  Oh.  What's it for?
   Cop:   We club people with it.
   -- Just conduct yourself properly and nobody gets hurt, ``''
   
 ``Well, it's about time!'' notes the across-the-street neighbor as she
 watches the two cops taking Bart away.
   
   Bart: So, you guys like being cops?
   Cop:  Oh, it's great.  You get to run red lights, park wherever you please,
         hot and cold running chicks...
   -- The perquisites of power, ``''
   
 The two cops point out Mayor Quimby's Cadillac parked in a motel.
   
   Tonight, His Honor is, heh, polling the electorate.
   -- Eddie explains Mayor Quimby's presence at a motel, ``''
   
 Inside, Quimby
 asks his date du jour, ``How would you uh like a street named after
 you?''

 Lisa is at her desk.  ``Dear log:  This will be my last entry, for you
 were a journal of my hopes and dreams.  And now, I have none.''

 While the cops wait for the light to change, the Kwik-E-Mart on the corner
 is robbed at gunpoint.  The light turns green, and the car continues on
 its way.
   
   Bart: Do you need straight A's to be a cop?
   The Two Cops:  [laugh uproariously]
   -- Just checking, ``''
   
 Bart asks for some action, but Eddie explains that the life of a cop is
 not the way it's portrayed in the movies.  Just then the man who held
 up the Kwik-E-Mart speeds past, and the two cops give chase.  Eddie
 radios in his report.  ``We are in pursuit of a speeding individual,
 driving a red... car, licence number Eggplant Xerxes Criminy Overbite
 Narwhale.''  The thief floors the gas, and a wild car chase ensues,
 just like on TV.  Meanwhile, Apu is tied up in his store.
   
   Ooh, they used nylon rope this time.  It feels so smooth against my skin.
   Almost sensuous...
   -- Apu, tied up after being robbed at gunpoint, ``''
   
 After a few more car chase cliches, the cops chase the car into an alley
 and block off one exit with the police car.  Their backup hasn't arrived,
 so Eddie, knowing it's against every regulation, gives Bart a handgun.
 ``Would you cover us?''  The two cops tiptoe along, and the bad guy's
 car screams down the alley, bearing down on Bart.  Bart fires hapazardly,
 then chucks his gun when it runs out of bullets.  ``See you in Hell,
 punk!'' gloats the robber.  Bart screams and covers his face.

 ``To be continued...''

 [End of Act One.  Time: 7:38]

 ``Act II:  Death Drives a Stick.''  After a brief recap of the final
 seconds of Act One, the bad guy's car skids to a halt because the
 alley grew too narrow for the car to pass.  It stops inches from Bart.
 The police backup finally arrives.  Wiggum finds a box full of lottery
 tickets in the car.
   
   Wiggum: Looks like you just bought yourself a lottery ticket.  To jail!
   Eddie:  He's unconscious, sir.
   Wiggum: Ah, they can still hear things.
   -- Subliminal messages, ``''
   
 Bart announces that he's going to be a cop when he grows up, and Wiggum
 makes him an honorary police officer.

 The next morning, Lisa comes down to breakfast, grousing.  ``Morning,
 Honey!'' greets Marge.  ``What's so good about it, stuck in the house
 by the stove...'' mutters Lisa.  Marge tells Lisa that homemaking leaves
 opportunity for creativity.  Marge shows Lisa how she arranged the bacon,
 eggs, toast (and sprig of parsley) into a smiley face on the plate.  Lisa
 asks, ``What's the point?  They'll never notice.''  Marge responds,
 ``You'll be surprised.''  Bart and Homer come down and immediately tear
 into their breakfast, destroying the delicately balanced food arrangement
 Marge slaved over.  (The sound of Homer eating here is hilarious.)

 Bart practices fingerprinting Maggie, who then crawls away, leaving
 ink stains on the carpet.  Marge scolds SLH when she finds him and
 a mangled chocolate cake.  But Bart shows her surveillance photos
 of Homer sneaking up on, then devouring said cake.  The last photo
 is of Bart taking a picture of his butt in the mirror.

 Marge finds Lisa in her room, reading comics and munching on chips.
 She has quit the band, and Marge suggests Lisa stay in band.  ``If
 you think it's so great, why don't &lt;you&gt; join the band?''  Marge
 tells a story about how people who told her what to do were wrong.
 A young Marge plays astronaut, but her sisters tell her that a woman
 can never be an astronaut.  Marge insists that they will, and there'll
 be colonies on the moon.  Lisa is not won over.

 Lisa watches Principal Skinner polish a statue of a puma in the
 school lobby.  Janey invites Lisa to quiz her on the vowels, but Lisa
 instead heads into a bathroom marked, ``Keep the hell out.''
 Janey warns, ``That's the bad girl bathroom.''  Lisa responds, ``Uh-doy!''

 Inside are two older girls (fifth graders?) smoking, and discussing
 egging Skinner's car.  Lisa tells them there's something even better
 they can go after...

 Skinner finds his puma egged and toilet papered.
   
   I saw some awful things in Nam, but you really have to wonder at the
   mentality that would desecrate a helpless puma!
   -- Principal Skinner, ``''
   
 Principal Skinner hears Groundskeeper Willie being arrested.  Bart
 reported him for burning leaves in violation of the town's clean air
 laws.
   
   Skinner: Bart Simpson on the side of law and order?  Has the world gone
            topsy-turvey?
   Bart:    That's right, man.  I got my first taste of authority...
            [rubs his hands]  And I liked it!
   -- ``''
   
 Skinner chats with Bart.
   
   Look, let's can the euphemisms.  No more bullspit.
   -- Principal Skinner, ``''
   
 Skinner offers Bart the position of hall monitor.  Bart isn't so sure,
 since it would involve squealing on other kids.  He imagines himself
 testifying in court (protected by a Blue Dot) against a mobster, his
 voice electronically altered to sound like Steve Allen.  Bart is won
 over when Skinner tells him he gets to wear a sash.

 Bart quickly takes charge.  No skateboarding in the halls.  No
 hogging the water fountain.  He saves Milhouse from a ``pink belly'',
 though Jimbo, Kerny and Dolph give Milhouse a parting wedgie.

 In bed...
   
   Marge: Bart's grades are up a little this term.
          But Lisa's are way down.
   Homer: Oh... We always have one good kid and one lousy kid.
          Why can't &lt;both&gt; our kids be good?
   Marge: We have &lt;three&gt; kids, Homer.
   Homer: Maaarge, the dog doesn't count as a kid!
   -- ``''
   
 Miss Hoover's class is doing some artwork with paste, construction paper,
 and sparkles.  (Ralph eats the paste.)  When Miss Hoover asks Lisa to
 sprinkle her sparkles, Lisa responds, ``Shove it.''

 Lisa is called into Skinner's office.  Skinner asks, ``Lisa, what are
 you rebelling against?''  Lisa answers, ``Whaddya got?''

 [End of Act Two.  Time: 13:55]

 The two girls in the bad girls' bathroom discuss Lisa's latest development.
 Lisa comes in, and they congratulate her.  Lisa is offered a cigarette,
 which she, after some thought, takes.  ``Uh...  I'll smoke it in class.''

 Skinner congratulates Bart on cleaning up the school.
   
   The school is a police state.  Students are afraid to sneeze.
   And I have you to thank.
   -- Principal Skinner to Hall Monitor Bart Simpson, ``''
   
 He takes Bart to the confiscated goods room (``Madre de Dios!  The legends
 were true!'') and lets Bart choose one item.  Bart selects a crossbow.

 In a '50s-movie style montage...
   
   Bart:    Seymour, this is an absence slip signed by Nelson's mother.
            And this is Nelson's English homework.  Notice the
            identical elongated loops on the `d's.
   Skinner: Forgery!  So he &lt;didn't&gt; have leprosy!
   -- The alibi falls apart, ``''
   
   Teacher: This is a great day for me.  I thought I could never teach again!
   Skinner: Oh, things have changed.  There will be no mockery of your name,
            Mr.  Glascock.
   -- I'm not touching this one, ``''
   
 Milhouse shoots a spitball at Kerny, who whines, ``Bart, do something!''
 Bart hauls Milhouse away.  Milhouse asks, ``Sure we have order, but at
 what price!''

 Miss Hoover goes over last night's homework.
   
   Ms.H: Lisa, what nineteenth-century figure was named `Old Hickory'?
   Lisa: I don't know.  You?  [snickers from the class]
   Ms.H: Lisa, if you'd bothered to do the assignment, you'd know the
         answer is... [flips to answer key]  The Battle of New Orleans.
         I mean... Andrew Jackson.
   Lisa: Well, you're earning &lt;your&gt; eighteen grand a year. [more snickers]
   -- ``''
   
 Lisa is given eraser clapping duties as punishment.  Lisa decides to
 take every Teacher's Edition from every classroom and hide them in her
 locker.

 In the smoke-filled teachers' lounge...
   
   Skinner: Um, ladies and gentlemen, the unthinkable has happened.
            Some sick, twisted individual has stolen every teacher's edition
            in this school.
   Teacher: What'll we do!?
   Ms. K:   Declare a snow day!
   Teacher: Does anyone know the multiplication table?
   Skinner: No, please, don't panic.  [peers out the window]  They can smell fear.
   -- Make no sudden movements, ``''
   
 The next day...
   
   Ms. K:  Children, I know this is highly irregular, but for the rest of the uh
           day, Martin will be teaching this class.
   Martin: I will?  But I wouldn't know where to begin.
   Ms. K:  Just do it, Braniac!
   -- Somebody stole all the teachers' editions of the school textbooks,
      ``''
   
 Other teachers also try to cope.  It proves too much for Miss Hoover.
 (``Calm blue ocean...  Calm blue ocean...'')  Mr. Glascock quits.

 Bart emerges from Skinner's private bathroom.  Skinner explains that
 the police haven't had any luck finding the teachers' editions...
 (Flash to Wiggum announcing that the dogs have picked up the scent of
 books.  They're standing in front of Old Springfield Library.  He orders the
 battering ram, which crashes through the doors.)  Bart stops Skinner from
 picking up the phone and ordering new books.
   
   Bart:    Seymour, I'll bet you a steak dinner those books are still here.
            All we have to do is search every locker.
   Skinner: Oh, Bart, I'm not sure random locker searches are permitted by
            the Supreme Court.
   Bart:    Pfffffft.  Supreme Court.  What have &lt;they&gt; done for us lately?
   Skinner: Let's move.
   -- Annoyed any Republicans today?  ``''
   
 With a Batman-style scene change, Bart and Skinner set to work searching
 the lockers.  They close in on Lisa's locker, and Bart gets there first.
 He's shocked that it's Lisa's locker.  Bart asks her why she did it.
 ``Come on, Bart.  In your pre-fascist days, you knew the giddy thrill of
 futile rebellion!''  Bart answers, ``Yeah, but even I had my limits.
 You're looking at expulsion for this.''  Lisa knows, and cries.

 Skinner arrives and is elated that the books have been found.  He asks
 who the culprit is, and Bart takes the fall, to the shock of all.
 Bart gloats that he duped Skinner once again, and Skinner decides that
 Bart's service to the school is a mitigating circumstance in his
 punishment.  Four hundred days' detention.  Bart acts cocky until
 it goes up to six hundred days, and Milhouse (the new hall monitor)
 takes Bart away.

 Lisa asks Bart why he did what he did.  ``Because I didn't want you
 to wreck your life.  You got the brains and the talent to go as far
 as you want.  And when you do, I'll be right there to borrow money.''

 As Bart does yet another blackboard punishment (``I will not expose
 the ignorance of the faculty''), Lisa plays her sax on the bench outside
 the window.  Bart offers some words of encouragement.

 Reviews


A. Warren Pratten {awp}:  I really enjoyed this week's show.  Bart reminded
me of a few guys in public school that were real trouble-makers until they
were made `prefects' by the principal.  From that moment on they became
`holier-than-thou' and the principal's pets.

Andrew Tannenbaum {trb}:  I thought it was a great warped episode, full of
odd references.  I give it a thumbs up.

Alan J. Rosenthal {ajr}:  Oh well, not one of the best.  [Later...]
I changed my mind completely when I watched it for the second time yesterday.
It's actually quite good!  I don't know why I didn't dig it the first time.

Joe Kincaid {jk}:  I really liked this episode.  I was laughing hysterically
all the way through Bart's facist period.

Yours Truly {rjc}:  A good idea that just didn't come together.  Probably
a victim of bad timing, coming too closely on the tail of ``Lisa the Greek'',
so the idea of Lisa gone bad lost its shock value.  And let's hope the
sappy endings aren't making a comeback.

The ``It's funny because it's true'' award goes to Lisa's, ``If
you think it's so great, why don't yoooooou join the band?''  A kid
with an attitude.

 Animation and continuity goofs

Despite some people's claims that the map on the wall of Bart's classroom
is ``out of this world'', I maintain that it is indeed a map of our planet,
grossly distorted.  Looks like a Mercator projection.

Mrs. Hoover is a Miss again.

Although we are led to believe that the kids actually did stare straight
ahead for fifteen minutes, the wall clock says otherwise.

The lip sync is off for Bart's ``Well, I'll be jiggered!''  Any guesses
as to what Bart &lt;really&gt; said?  Is it printable?

Chief Wiggum's badge vanishes briefly.  And once the bad guy's car stops,
room magically appears around it.

Rolf Wilson {rw}:  As Bart discovers the locker with the Teacher's Editions,
he takes out 4 books, revealing the family picture.  Then Lisa slams the
locker shut.  In the very next scene, all the books are on the floor of
the hall.  Dave Hall {dh} suggests that this was merely an editing decision.
After all, do we really want to watch Bart take all the books out of the
locker?

Theron Stanford {tws} points out the continuing inconsistency in the
placement of Lisa's and Bart's classrooms.  In the opening of this episode,
Bart's classroom is above Lisa's.  But later, Lisa claps erasers out the
upper-story window, and Bart does his blackboard punishment on the ground
floor.  There are additional inconsistencies in ``Bart the Lover'' and
``Lisa's Substitute''.

From one angle, Bart's second blackboard punishment is written as one
giant paragraph.  But when the angle changes, Bart's punishment puts
each sentence on a line by itself.

 The Iowa Standardized Tests


    During the late '70s and early '80s, the Iowa Test of Basic Skills
    was used by many school districts throughout the country.  Merely
    saying the words ``Iowa Test'' to a student would evoke a strong
    reaction.

 Car chase cliches

   Car chase music.
   The chased car loses a tire rim (not a hubcap) going around a turn.
   Down a San Francisco hill.  (The cars leave the ground when they hit
        a small incline.)
   An oncoming car (punchbuggy green!) swerves into a parked milk truck,
        which explodes into flames.
        (The milk truck looks like a gasoline tanker, except
        it has the word `MILK' painted clearly on the side.)
   Crashing through (empty) boxes.

   Missing:  The cars don't crash through a vegetable stand.  (My personal
   favorite car chase cliche.)

   And listen to Bart's noises as he fires the gun and throws it aside
   afterwards.

1968 Dodge Charger.  Orange, like ``The Dukes of Hazzard''.

 The Army thought that Homer was too heavy, and the police thought he

   was too dumb.  Note that the Army didn't think Homer was too dumb
   or the police that he was too heavy. {jk}

 That's it.  Bart sets the record for having been voiced by the most people.

   Nancy Cartwright, Daniel Stern, Neil Patrick Harris (sort of), and
   Steve Allen.

 You'd think Jimbo, Kerny, and Dolph would have dropped out of school.

 EPISODE TITLE: Dog of Death


EPISODE SUMMARY: 

 A ridiculous state lottery advertisement.
   
   Employee:  I don't need your crummy job, Mr. Employer!  I've won the lottery!
   Employer:  Well, who needs employees?  I won the lottery, too!
             [two window washers descend on a scaffold, each with a huge
              bag of cash (money overflowing) at his feet]
   Window washers: We both won the lottery!
   All:       [to camera] Why don't you win the lottery, too!
   Announcer: The state lottery, where everybody wins!
              (actual odds of winning, one in 380,000,000.)
   -- Truth in advertising, ``''
   
 The gang at Moe's Tavern watch the commercial.  Moe expresses his scorn.
   
   Bleah.  The state lottery.  Exploiter of the poor and ignorant.
   [turns on his neon sign:  BEER IS THE ANSWER]
   -- Moe scoffs at a lottery advertisement, ``''
   
 But
 the rest of the gang go berzerk when they hear that the payoff is $130
 million.  They rush en masse to the Kwik-E-Mart, which is a madhouse.
   
   [on the phone]  Bart, I need some lucky numbers, fast!
   How old are you? ...  [jots it down]  Uh huh.
   And what's your birthday? ...  [jots it down]  No kidding.
   And what's Lisa's birthday? ...   What?  You don't know your
   sister's birthday??  What kind of brother are you!
   -- Homer catches lottery fever, ``''
   
   Apu:    Snap on your bulletproof vest, Sanjay, it's time for another bank run.
   Sanjay: All right.  But if I don't make it, promise you won't sleep with
           my wife.
   Apu:    I promise nothing.
   -- Read my lips, no lewd lapses, ``''
   
 At home...
   
   Homer: You'll never guess what happened, Marge.  Are you ready?
          I have a feeling that we may win... the lottery!!
   Marge: But we never, ever...
   Homer: I know you're excited, but calm down and listen to me carefully...
   -- Brimming with excitement, ``''
   
 Homer wants Marge to get all her money, but Marge says the full extent
 of her lottery involvement is one ticket a week with the girls at the
 hair salon.  They each play their birthday.  During the discussion, a very
 sick Santa's Little Helper wanders past.
   
   Marge: Homer, we're on a tight budget, here.  Promise me you won't get
          carried away.
   Homer: Yes, money.  ...  I mean, honey.
   -- Homer catches lottery fever, ``''
   
 A news report on the lottery comes on the TV.  (``Down in front!'' yells
 Homer at SLH.  SLH collapses.)  Kent Brockman reports that every copy
 of Shirley Jackson's ``The Lottery'' has been checked out of the library.
 Nevermind that it has absolutely nothing to do with winning the lottery.
 Homer angrily tosses his copy into the fireplace.
   
   Kent:    But there's already one big winner:  Our state school system,
            which gets fully half the profits from the library.
   Skinner: [talking with his teachers]
            Just think what we can buy with that money...
            History books that know how the Korean War came out.
            Math books that don't have that base six crap in them!
            And a state-of-the-art detention hall [holds up a scale model]
            where children are held in place with magnets.
   Teacher: [to no one in particular]  Magnets.  Always with the magnets...
   -- ``''
   
 Homer is convinced, having bought $50 worth of tickets, that he's going
 to win the lottery.  He asks the kids what they're going to do with
 their share of the money.  Bart'll put it in the bank.  Lisa will give
 it to the poor.  (How socially responsible of her.)  Homer scoffs, ``What
 do kids know about spending money.''  Homer dreams another impossible
 dream.  I won't try to describe it.

 It's lottery time.
   
   Kent: We now take you to the [lottery] drawing, live.  I hope you've got
         &lt;your&gt; tickets.  I've got mine.
   [at the police station, everyone's watching.  The phone rings.]
   Eddie:  They're about to start, Chief.
   Wiggum: [answers the phone]  No, you got the wrong number.
           This is nine-one....two.
   -- Lottery fever, ``''
   
 Krusty and Mel take time out from their show to watch the drawing.

 The first number is 17.  Homer tears up his tickets.  Marge note that
 you can still win something for matching five of six.  The second number
 is 3.  Homer tears up the tickets again.  Grampa sighs, ``I knew we
 wouldn't win.''  Homer scolds his father for keeping this information
 to himself.
   
   If you were seventeen, we'd be rich!
   But nooooooooooo...  You had to be ten.
   -- Homer scolds Bart, whose age he used to select his losing lottery numbers,
      ``''
   
 The final number is drawn, and Kent Brockman realizes he's won.  He
 celebrates, then regains his composure.  ``Recapping our day's top story,
 the winner of today's state lottery is... me, Kent Brockman.  Can we get
 a shot of me?''  A picture of Kent from a few seconds ago appears.
 ``There we go.''  He sets his ticket aside and tries to continue with
 the rest of the news, but he can't stand it any more and dashes off.

 Marge, always looking on the bright side, notes, ``At least we've still
 got each other.''  Grampa announces that the dog is dead, and the family
 rush over to find a limp SLH on the kitchen floor.

 [End of Act One.  Time: 5:13]

 But the dog isn't dead.  He's just very weak.  Grampa refuses to admit
 his mistake...
   
   I'm tired of this conversation.  Let's talk about something else.
   I'm going home.
   -- Grampa Simpson, ``''
   
 The family take SLH to Springfield Animal Hospital, where the vet tries,
 but fails, to resuscitate a hamster with electrical heart stimulation.
 (The zapping appears to be doing more harm than good...)
 Realizing that the patient is lost, he says, ``This is the part of the
 job I hate.''  He takes the hamster and tosses it into a tiny basketball
 hoop mounted over the waste basket.

 Next up is SLH, which he diagnoses with a twisted stomach.  The life-saving
 operation will cost $750.  Homer says they'll talk about it as he carries
 SLH out of the examining room.  Bart constantly asks, ``What's there to
 talk about?''  In the waiting room is Krusty with a cigar-smoking chimp.
 ``Mister Teeny needs a refill of his nicotine gum.''

 On the ride home, Bart asks when SLH is going to have his operation, but
 Homer changes the subject...
   
   I want to tell you about the most wonderful place in the world:  Doggie heaven.
   In doggie heaven, there are mountains of bones, and you can't turn around
   without sniffing another dog's butt!
   -- Homer talks to Bart when SLH falls ill, ``''
   
 Homer lists some dogs in doggie heaven.
   
   Bart:  Is there a doggie hell?
   Homer: Well... Of course, there couldn't be a heaven if there weren't a hell.
   Bart:  Who's in there?
   Homer: Oh, uh... Hitler's dog... and that dog Nixon had, what's his name,
          um, Chester...
   Lisa:  [annoyed] Checkers.
   Homer: Yeah!  One of the Lassies is in there, too.  The mean one!
          The one that mauled Jimmy!
   -- Are there pirates in doggie hell?  ``''
   
 Bart asks, ``Wait a minute.  Does this have anything to do with SLH?''
   
   Marge: Honey, $750 is a lot of money.  We really can't afford this operation.
   Bart:  You're gonna just let him [SLH] die?
   Marge: I know you're upset...
   Bart:  Darn right, I'm upset!
   Marge: Bart, watch your language! ... Oh, you did.  Sorry.
   -- Save it for later, ``''
   
 Bart refuses to let them let SLH die.  He leaves, grumbling, ``Lousy,
 dog-killing, son-of-a...''

 Homer figures they'll get Bart a new dog, ``one with an untwistable
 stomach!''  SLH places his head in Homer's lap and whimpers pathetically.
 Homer eventually gives in.  ``Lousy, manipulative dog...''

 Homer pays a visit to Mr. Burns's office and asks to borrow money.
 Burns sort-of furtively summons security, who takes Homer away.
   
   Smithers: People like dogs, Mr. Burns.
   Burns:    Nonsense.  Dogs are idiots!  Think about it, Smithers.
             If I came into your house and started sniffing at your
             crotch and slobbering all over your face, what would
             you say?
   Smithers: ...  If &lt;you&gt; did it, sir?
   -- A tough question, ``''
   
 Marge catches Homer reading a Canine Surgery book and tells him he will
 not attempt the operation himself.  Homer says it's as easy as carving
 a turkey.  He then flashes back to Thanksgiving dinner, as all the
 guests shield their faces from the onslaught of lacerated turkey meat
 flying from Homer's electric knife...  He tosses the book into the
 fireplace.

 The family are gathered around the dinner table.  Marge says she found
 a way for them to pay for the operation, but it'll entail sacrifices.
 Homer will have to give up beer, Bart will have to get his hair cut for
 free at Springfield Barber College, Marge will forego her weekly lottery
 ticket as well as stretching the food money.
   
   Marge: I found a way to stretch the food budget.
          Fried chicken night will now be organ meat night.
          Ham night will be Spam night.
          And pork chop night...
   Homer: [whining, fearing the worst] Oh...
   Marge: ... will now be chub night.
   Homer: Chub!?  I don't even know what that is!
   -- Neither do I, ``''
   
 Lisa won't be able to get volume 4 of Encyclopedia Generica from the
 grocery store (Copernicus to Elephantiasis), and Maggie's baby clothes
 will have to last a little longer.  (Maggie makes a muscle and her
 sleeve rips.)
   
   Marge, I've figured out an alternative to giving up my beer.
   Basically, we become a family of travelling acrobats!
   -- Homer's budget-saving plan, ``''
   
 The family wait in the animal hospital waiting room.
 Mr. Danielson's game cock has been saved.
 SLH goes under the knife.  The EKG goes flat...

 SLH runs down a tunnel...  ``Come to the light, boy...''
 SLH reaches the pearly gates, with its doggie door.  Then retreats...

 SLH returns to the world of the living, thanks to mouth-to-mouth
 resuscitation.

 A bandaged SLH is returned to the Simpsons.
   
   It's times like this I'm glad I flunked out of dental school.
   -- Veterinarian, ``''
   
 Two days later, it's ``lousy chub night''.  Homer spots SLH's dinner dish.
   
   Homer: Hey, how come he [SLH] gets meat and we don't?
   Marge: You wouldn't want what he's eating.  It's mostly just snouts and
          entrails.
   Homer: Mmmmmm...  snouts...
   -- ``''
   
 Kent Brockman's news report is somehow different.  Maybe it's the gold
 jewelry he's wearing.  Or the fur coat.
   
   Homer: Well, he's got all the money in the world, but there's one thing
          he can't buy.
   Marge: What's that?
   Homer: [thinks]  A dinosaur!
   -- ``''
   
 The next item is Principal Skinner receiving the lottery proceeds on
 behalf of the school system.  Springfield Elementary gets a brand new
 chalkboard eraser.  Skinner blows up, ``One eraser?  Well, I'm used to
 my government betraying me.  I was in Nam.  I served for three..''

 Kent announces this week's numbers:  3, 6, 17, 18, 22 and 29.
 Marge complains, ``If it wasn't for that dog, I would've won'' since
 those are the numbers she normally plays every week.

 Maggie's clothes fall apart, leaving her naked on the couch.

 Ms. Hoover tells the class they have to write a report on Copernicus.
 (Lisa slaps her forehead.  ``D'oh!'')

 Homer sings at Moe's Tavern for spare change.

 Bart suffers a horrible haircut at the barber college.

 SLH goes to each family member in turn.  Homer tells the dog to shove off.
 Marge is busy mending Maggie's clothes (while they're still in her back).
 Lisa is busy reading a ``third-rate biography of Copernicus'' she found
 at the bus station.  Bart just says, ``Dumb dog.''  SLH slinks away.

 In bed, Marge asks Homer if he closed the gate. ``Yes.''  We hear the
 gate swinging in the wind.  ``Oh, you mean &lt;tonight&gt;.''  Homer calls,
 ``Bart!  Close the gate.''  Bart yells, ``Lisa, close the gate!''  Lisa
 says, ``Close the gate, Maggie.''  Maggie lies in her crib, wearing a
 Crown Royal pouch as her baggie.

 SLH wanders out the gate, takes one last look at the house of the family
 that no longer loves him, and heads down the street.

 [End of Act Two.  Time: 14:10]

 The family call for SLH from the lawn, but he doesn't come.
 Homer:  ``Wait, there he is!  ...  No, that's a horse...''
 (Isn't that illegal? [8[FG]06])

 To the strains of Peter's Theme from Peter and the Wolf, we trace SLH's
 wanderings on a map.  He goes down Springfield River, into the woods
 (encountering a grizzly), through Swartzwelder County, rescues a baby
 from a burning house, chases a cat, and reaches the Michael Jackson
 Expressway, where he is picked up by the Springfield Dog Pound.

 Meanwhile, Marge is having trouble finding a picture of SLH in the
 photo album that she's willing to let the public see.

 Ned finishes his recycling spiel to Burns, who sarcastically says he
 can't wait to paw through his garbage.  ``Release the hounds.''  Ned's
 running shoes prove helpful.  One of the hounds (``Crippler'') is old,
 and Burns remembers the dog's hippie-nabbing during the sixties.

 Burns and Smithers look for a replacement at the dog pound, and they
 find SLH (busy sniffing another dog's butt).
   
   Why here's a fellow.  Wiry, fast, firm, proud buttocks.  Reminds me of me...
   -- Monty Burns selects a new attack dog (SLH), ``''
   
 Meanwhile, Homer finishes posting a huge sequence of posters of SLH,
 then walks away.  The building he posted them on is demolished.

 SLH's first lesson as an attack dog:  Neutralizing intruders.
 Smithers is dressed as a girl scout (``Wanna buy some cookies?''),
 but SLH just licks his face.
   
   If that were a real girl scout, I'd have been bothered by now!
   -- Burns scolds SLH, his new attack dog, ``''
   
 Lisa shows Barney a poster.
   
   I know how you feel.  I lost my dog, too.  He's in here somewhere...
   [a muffled whimper emerges from somewhere in his apartment]
   -- Barney can't help find SLH, ``''
   
 His eyelids propped open, SLH is forced to watch a movie.  Another
 sequence that defies description.

 The family are nearly resigned to having lost SLH forever.
   
   That was his dish...  And that was his leash...  And that's where he took
   a wizz on the rug... [sobs]
   -- Homer looks back on the days with Santa's Little Helper, ``''
   
   Marge: Homer, get a hold of yourself.  Even if he [SLH] &lt;has&gt; passed on,
          there's no reason to cry.  Remember, doggie heaven?
   Homer: Oh, Marge, there is no such place!
   Marge: Ahem.
   Homer: [spots the kids]  Or...  To put it another way...  There &lt;is&gt;...
   -- Yes and no, ``''
   
   Bart:  I'm not giving up.  I don't care if I have to knock on every door
          in this two-bit town.  I'm going to find my dog!
   Homer: And I'll be right here watching TV.
   -- He'll be with you in spirit, maybe, ``''
   
 Meanwhile, Burns taunts SLH into attacking him.  Success.

 A very tan Kent Brockman answers his door.
   
   Kent: [answering the door]  Hello, I'm Kent Brockman.
   Bart: Um, excuse me, sir.  I lost my dog.
   Kent: Mm hm.  And I suppose you want me to buy you a new one, mm?
         You know, ever since I won the lottery, everybody wants a
         piece of Kent Brockman.  Homeless this and hungry that...
   -- ``''
   
 Kent is called back in by his butler.  ``Your llama just bit
 Ted Kennedy.''  ``Good!''

 Bart rings Burns' door.  Burns is in one of those glass cases.
   
   Smithers: Um, I hate to interrupt your longevity treatment, sir,
             but there's a sweet little boy at the door.
   Burns:    Release the hounds.
   -- ``''
   
 The hounds are released, with SLH leading the pack.  Bart recognizes
 his dog, but the recognition isn't mutual.  Bart runs for his life
 and is cornered by SLH.  SLH leaps (in slo-mo) at Bart, then (in
 a doggie flashback) eventually recognizes his former master.
 SLH growls at the other attack dogs, who scurry away.

 SLH is back in his loving home, being petted by everyone.

 As we pull back from the Simpsons house, the following subtitles appear...
   
   NO DOGS WERE HARMED IN THE FILMING OF THIS EPISODE.
   A CAT GOT SICK AND SOMEBODY SHOT A DUCK, BUT THAT'S IT.
   -- Watching cartoons is also dolphin-safe, ``''

 EPISODE TITLE: Colonel Homer


EPISODE SUMMARY: 

 The family wander through the Googolplex Cinema parking lot, trying to find
 a parking space.  Every spot they find is stolen from them just before they
 reach it.  Homer finds a space labelled ``Compacts only''.  He reasons,
 ``Marge, that's just a suggested car size.''  Homer squeezes the car into
 the space (scratching the cars on either side in the process).  ``How am
 I doing on the right?''  Lisa responds, ``Well, we're getting a lot of
 sparks over here, Dad.''  Homer `succeeds' in parking the car.  ``Okay,
 everyone out the window.''

 Unable to find a movie to suit everyone, Marge suggests the kids see one
 movie while she and Homer watch something else.  Bart and Lisa dash off.
 Homer wants to see ``Look Who's Oinking'', but it's sold out, so he has
 to settle for ``The Stockholm Affair'', a highbrow political movie.

 Homer does every single annoying thing a person has ever done in a movie
 theater.  Meanwhile, Lisa covers her eyes while Bart thoroughly enjoys
 a gory scene from the latest Space Mutant movie.
   
   Bart: If you don't watch the violence, you'll never get desensitized to it.
   Lisa: [covering her eyes] Please tell me when the scary part's over.
   Bart: [pause]  It's over.
   Lisa: [uncovers her eyes]
         [the movie theater is bathed in red as we hear blood spurting]
         Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh!
   -- Watching `Space Mutant VI', ``''
   
 Homer continues being incredibly annoying, including giving away the
 ending.  The other viewers throw their food at him, and Marge bawls
 him out.

 On the car ride home, Marge tries to apologize, but Homer is still mad.
 Bart uses a magic marker (drawing directly on Homer's head) to illustrate.

 Marge, Bart and Lisa stand by the car.  Homer is still behind the wheel.
 ``I'm going now, and I don't know when you'll see me again.''  He speeds
 off.  Then comes back, hands over Maggie, and speeds off again.  Lisa
 remarks, ``I guess that executive stress ball we gave him isn't working.''

 Homer drives along the highway.  Billboard:  ``Flaming Pete's [picture
 of a steak] 75 miles.''  Homer continues.  The next billboard reads the
 same, but this time only ``30 miles''.  Another billboard, reading
 ``Next exit.''  Homer reaches the next exit.  Flaming Pete's has burnt down.

 Homer continues his long drive, trying to hold his breath as he goes past
 various smelly things.  He reaches ``The Beer -n- Brawl'' tavern.
   
   Man 1:  Hey you, let's fight.
   Man 2:  Them's fightin' words!
   -- Say what you mean, ``''
   
 Homer tries to order a Duff, but they only serve Fudd.
   
   Okay, Fudd me.
   -- Homer orders a beer, ``''
   
 The musical performer is Yodelin' Zeke.

 The next act is Lurleen, their waitress.  Though the bar denizens react
 poorly to the fact that drink service will stop.  Lurleen sings a song
 she just wrote, which describes Homer's current state down to the last
 detail.  Well, almost.  The song concludes, ``Your wife don't understand
 you, but I do.''

 After her song, Homer approaches Lurleen.  ``Your song touched me in a way
 I've never felt before.  And which way to the can?''

 [End of Act One]
   
   Lurleen: So what's your name, stranger?
   Homer:   Homer J. Simpson.
   Lurleen: My name's Lurleen Lumpkin.
   Homer:   That's a pretty name.
   Lurleen: Oh, you think so?
   Homer:   Maybe.  I'm not sure.  I forgot it.
   -- Persistence of memory, ``''
   
 Homer arrives home the next morning, singing.  Homer's diction has taken
 distinctly country/western turn.  Homer sings at work, carelessly pulling
 levers back and forth.  Power cuts in and out all across town.
   
           [in the operating room, the power flickers]
   Nurse:  Doctor, you weren't supposed to remove his gall bladder.
   Doctor: Put it back!  Put it back!
   -- It was like that when I got here!  ``''
   
 Lenny scoffs at Homer's singing to his bowling ball, until he learns
 that Homer's bowling a 280.  Lenny gives it a shot.

 Homer tries to order a Fudd at Moe's Tavern, but Moe says that he thought
 it was pulled off the market ``after all those hillbillies went blind.''
 Homer says he got some at another bar, and Moe is shocked that Homer
 went to another bar.

 Homer drives to Lurleen's mobile home in Spittle County.
   
   Lurleen, I can't get your song out of my mind.
   I haven't felt this way since Funky Town!
   -- Homer, ``''
   
 Homer asks for a copy, but Lurleen says they're all in her head.
 So Homer insists they ``crack open [her] head and scoop out those
 songs.''  He takes her to Lucky's Records, where Lurleen records
 her song on a CD (for 25 cents).  The clerk (Wade) says his brother
 owns a radio station in Weevilville, and Homer grants permission to
 let them play the song.

 The song is played on KUDD 570 AM.  The effects of the song are profound.
   
   Moe:    [listening to a song on the radio]  For the next half hour,
           beer is on the house.
   Barney: [bursts out of the men's room]  What'd you say, Moe?
           [pull back to see that the bar is otherwise empty]
   Moe:    Nuthin'.
   -- Trees falling in the forest, ``''
   
   Krusty: [slapping Sideshow Mel]  I thought I told you to stay away from
           my sister!!
           [a song comes on the radio]
           [softens]  Oh, here's 50 bucks.  Take her to the Copa.
   -- Calms the savage breast, ``''
   
 The music even quells a riot at the prison.

 The family listen at home.
   
   I can feel her sweet country soul in every digitally-encoded bit.
   -- Lisa, ``''
   
   Country music sucks.  All it does is take precious air space away from
   shock DJ's, whose cruelty and profanity amuse us all.
   -- Bart the Critic, ``''
   
   Marge: Who is this woman?
   Homer: Well, right now, she's an out-of-work cocktail waitress,
          but she's going to be a country music superstar like...
          uh... that jerk in the cowboy hat... and that dead lady.
   -- ``''
   
 Marge expresses her disapproval.
   
   Marge, you make it sound so seamy.
   All I did was spend the afternoon in her trailer watching her try on
   some outfits.
   -- Homer tries to reassure Marge, ``''
   
 This fails to reassure her.  Homer answers the phone.  It's Lurleen.
 ``Uh, I think I can come over.  Lemme ask my wife.''  Marge yells
 ``Mmmmmmmm'' as loud as humanly possible.  Homer replies, ``It's a
 date.''  Homer visits Lurleen, who is immensely grateful.
   
   Lurleen: Homer, no man has ever been this nice to me without... you know...
            wantin' sum'in' in return.
   Homer:   Well, now, I was going to ask you for a glass of water, but now
            I feel kinda guilty about it.
   -- Ask and you shall receive, ``''
   
   Lurleen: [chuckles] Oh Homer, you're just a big sack of sugar.
   Homer:   Hey!  [thinks on it]  You &lt;did&gt; say sugar, right?
   -- ``''
   
   Lurleen: Homer, I want you to be my manager.
   Homer:   Really?!  Well, I should warn you, I'm not great with figures.
   Lurleen: That's okay.
   Homer:   I make a lot of stupid decisions.
   Lurleen: Nobody's perfect.
   Homer:   I did bad in school.
   Lurleen: I didn't even go.
   Homer:   My personal hygeine has been described as...
   -- Is that a fair recital of my deficiencies?  ``''
   
 Lurleen takes Homer to the Coruplent Cowboy, a clothing store.
   
   Now this is made from a space-age fabric specially designed for Elvis.
   Sweat actually cleans this suit!
   -- Clerk at the Corpulent Cowboy, ``''
   
 Slightly past midnight, Marge sleeps alone in bed.  Homer finally arrives
 home, clad in traditional gaudy Western attire.  Marge is furious and
 asks him if he's having an affair.  Homer denies it, but admits under
 interrogation that Lurleen did kiss him a couple of times.  Marge forbids
 Homer to become her manager.
   
   Homer: Marge, you're standing in the way of my boyhood dream of
          managing a beautiful country singer!
   Marge: Your boyhood dream is to eat the world's biggest hoagie!
          And you did it at the county fair last year, remember!?
   -- ``''
   
 Marge holds up a picture to illustrate.  Homer says that, whether she
 likes it or not, he's going to make Lurleen a star.  Marge snaps back,
 ``Fine.  See if I care.''  Homer leaves.

 [End of Act Two]

 Homer hands over a huge wad of cash to the man at the recording studio.
   
   Marge: Homer, how much did you just give that man!?
   Homer: Calm down, Marge, it's just our life savings.  I'm not going into hock
          for this.
   -- ``''
   
 Lurleen kisses ``'' greeting, but her reception from Marge is
 decidedly less pleasant.
   
   Marge: Hm...  I thought you said she was overweight.
   Homer: Marge, it takes two to lie.  One to lie and one to listen.
   -- Tangoing optional, ``''
   
 The recording session is under way, as Bart and Maggie entertain themselves
 with the equipment.  Lisa plays her sax as Lurleen sings about a baseball
 metaphor for love titled ``Bagged Me a Homer''.  But the recording has to
 stop because they're getting a grinding noise on the track.  Marge
 gnashes her teeth loudly.

 Lurleen becomes a hit, and the kids help with the production.  Bart slips
 the records into the sleeve, Lisa stamps the jacket, and a heavily
 lipsticked Maggie kisses it.  (Leaving lip-prints on the album cover.)
   
   Homer:   Guess what, Lurleen.  I got you a gig on TV!
   Lurleen: [squeals with delight]  Oh, Homer!  You're as smart as you
            are handsome!
   Homer:   [angry] Hey!  [softens]  Oh, you meant that as a compliment.
   -- ``''
   
 The TV show wants her to sing two sings, and Homer suggests she sing a new
 song.  She privately sings for him a song she just wrote ``that could really
 heat things up''.  It's titled, ``Bunk with Me Tonight.''  Homer misses
 the not-so-subtle intent.  Lurleen sings it again, a bit more pointedly,
 and it finally sinks in.  Homer makes his escape.

 Marge is on the phone with her sister.
   
   Marge: All our money's tied up in this woman.  If she fails, we're broke.
          If she succeeds, I have no husband.  I don't know what to root for.
   Patty: You don't?
   -- ``''
   
 Preparing for Lurleen's television debut, Homer struggles with his
 string-tie.  Marge notes that while Homer and Lurleen were out judging
 a greased pig contest, Maggie cut her first tooth.  But Homer isn't
 listening.  She calls in the kids, who are adorably dressed in their
 Sunday best.  ``You've got a wonderful family, Homer.  Please don't
 forget it when you walk out that door tonight.''  Homer leaves.
   
   Much as I hate that man right now, you gotta love that suit.
   -- Bart on Homer, ``''
   
 The television show in question is ``Ya-Hoo!'', a spoof of ``Hee-Haw''.
 While Lurleen sings ``Bagged Me a Homer'', Homer is approached by a
 well-dressed gentleman.
   
   I'm from Rebel Yell Records, a division of the Tokasagi Corporation.
   -- ``''
   
 Homer refuses to sell Lurleen's contract.

 In Lurleen's dressing room, Homer asks if there's anything she needs.
 Lurleen bolts the door shut and kisses him.  Homer stops.  ``My whole
 romantic life is flashing before my eyes!''  And it does.  It involves
 lots of slapping.  Then came Marge.  Homer tells Lurleen that his goal
 was to share her voice with other people, and he's done it.  ``I'd better
 get out of here before I lose my family.''  He leaves, then pokes his
 head back in the door.  ``Just so I don't wonder.  You would've gone all
 the way with me, wouldn't you?''  She nods.

 Homer approaches the agent.
   
   Now before we negotiate, I have to tell you I'm desperate to unload Lurleen,
   and I'll take any offer.
   -- Homer Simpson, Master Bargainer, ``''
   
 He sells the contract for $50.

 At Homer, Marge sits in bed (naked) watching the incredibly feeble
 ``Ya-Hoo!'' program.  Homer arrives home.  ``Is there any room in the
 bed for a gad-durned fool?''  ``Always has been.''  While Lurleen sings
 ``Stand By Your Manager'', Homer undresses (but keeps the hat) and gets
 into bed.  Her song concludes, ``I hope that Marge knows just how lucky
 she is.''  Marge says, ``I do'', and the two kiss.  Homer tosses his hat
 onto the camera.

 EPISODE TITLE: Black Widower


EPISODE SUMMARY: 

 Homer and the kids sit on the couch in their Sunday best watching television.
   
   Dad Dinosaur:  Would you turn off that rock-and-rock music?
   Boy Dinosaur:  Hey, don't have a stegasaurus, man!
   -- Television on television, ``''
   
   These talking dinosaurs are more real than most &lt;real&gt; families on TV.
   -- Lisa watches `Dinosaurs', ``''
   
 Quick shot of a baby dinosaur bashing its papa with a frying pan.
 (Papa dinosaur yells, ``D'oh!  D'oh!'')
   
   It's like they saw our lives and put it right up on screen!
   -- Bart watches `Dinosaurs', ``''
   
 Marge and Patty come in, and Patty wants to relate some disturbing
 information about Selma's new boyfriend before they arrive.
 Lisa imagines Selma with a man so disfigured he wears a hood.
 Homer imagines a man without a body, his head kept alive by elaborate
 machinery.  Bart imagines Selma with Homer.  (``Bleah!'')
   
   Patty: Aunt Selma has this crazy obsession about not dying alone.
          So in desperation, she joined this prison pen-pal program.
          Her new sweetie's a jailbird.
   Bart:  Coooool!  He can teach us how to kill a man with a lunchtray!
   -- ``''
   
 Marge tries to explain that he's an &lt;ex&gt;-convict.  ``He's paid his debt to
 society.''  Patty wonders why Marge isn't using the good silverware.

 Selma arrives with her boyfriend.  It's... Sideshow Bob!  The kids scream
 in fear.  Sideshow Bob explains that Bart is the ``seamus in short pants''
 who put him in jail.

 At dinner...
   
   Homer: Gee, if some snot-nosed little kid sent &lt;me&gt; to prison,
          the first thing out, I'd find out where he lives, and...
          [vigorously mimes with his steak knife] tear him a new belly button!
          Ungh!  Ungh!  Lousy snitch!  Yaargh!
   Bart:  [laughs nervously, loosens his collar]
   -- Don't give him any ideas, dear.  ``''
   
   Sideshow Bob:  Ah, Mr. Simpson, you're forgetting the first two noble
          truths of the Buddha.
   Homer: I am not!
   -- ``''
   
 Sideshow Bob tells his story.  He became a ``seething cauldron of rage and
 recrimination''.  While picking up litter along the highway (Krusty Burger
 wrappings, mostly) Sideshow Bob gets a faceful of a Krusty milkshake tossed
 out of Krusty's stretch limo.  His bitterness ruined his nomination for
 a Daytime Emmy.  Krusty is the awards presenter, and Sideshow Bob wins
 the award.  He accepts angrily from his prison cell...
   
   Just don't drop that thing in the shower, Bob!
   -- Krusty's bitter remarks towards an imprisoned Sideshow Bob upon the
      latter's winning of a Daytime Emmy, ``''
   
 ... and has to be restrained and tranquilized.
   
   Now for the highlight of the evening, Best Film-to-Video Transfer.
   -- Krusty hosts the Daytime Emmys, ``''
   
 Sideshow Bob asks his audience, ``Do you know what prison is like for a
 lifelong conservative Republican?''  He continues his story.  In his
 prison cell, his stick of lip balm becomes community property.  His
 only joy is plotting revenge against Bart while making anti-Bart license
 plates.
   
   Sideshow Bob:  [menacingly] Bart, if I wanted to kill you, I'd have choked
           you like a chicken the moment I walked in that door.
   Family: Gasp!
   Sideshow Bob:  [cheerily]  But then, what kind of guest would I have been?
   Family: [chuckle, except for Bart]
   -- On the other hand, if he'd brought a gift first... ``''
   
 Back to the story...
   
   Sideshow Bob:  You can't take my Emmy!
   Prison Guard:  Hey, you know the rules.  Awards for excellence in entertainment
                  are contraband.  No Emmys, no Oscars, not even a Golden Globe.
   -- ``''
   
 Sideshow Bob's Emmy is added to a huge pile of other awards.

 Sideshow Bob receives a letter as part of the prison pen-pal program...
   
   Dear No 24601...
       I need a man, and I cannot find one among the law-abiding.
       I have a steady job and a lucrative hobby filing nuisance lawsuits.
   I share an apartment with my twin sister.  Enclosed is a photo of us on
   a tandem bike.  I forget which one I am.
   -- Selma's letter to Sideshow Bob, ``''
   
 Sideshow Bob composes his reply, which Selma reads in the tub.  Overcome,
 Selma slowly sinks, the tip of her cigarette being the last to submerge.
 Their love bloomed.  During a visitation, Sideshow Bob asks to kiss
 Selma through the glass.  She presses her cheek against the glass (the
 cheek growing to gargantuan proportions in the process).  ``Inspired
 by the love of a good woman, I resolved to be the best prisoner number
 24601 I could be.''  He plays the violin near the conjugal visit trailers.
 He bids farewell to his cellmates.  That concludes the story, and everyone
 sighs adorably.  Except for Bart.
   
   You're living proof that our revolving door prison system works.
   -- Lisa to Sideshow Bob, ``''
   
 Marge notes that she's never seen Selma so happy, giggling like a schoolgirl.
 Selma giggles sickly.  Sideshow Bob makes a joke about his ex-con status,
 and all find it amusing.  Except for Bart.  Bart reminds everyone that
 Sideshow Bob framed Krusty, and Sideshow Bob thanks Bart for doing so,
 and thereby allowing him to meet Selma.
   
   Sideshow Bob: Selma, would you mind if I did something bold and shocking
          in front of your family?
   Selma: All right.  But no tongues. [removes her cigarette and puckers up]
   Sideshow Bob: Although kissing you would be like kissing some divine
          ashtray, that's not what I had in mind.
   -- ``''
   
   Kissing you would be like kissing some divine ashtray.
   -- Sideshow Bob to his new love Selma, ``''
   
   Sideshow Bob:  Selma, will you marry me?
   Bart:  Don't be a fool, Aunt Selma!  That man is scum!
   Selma: Then call me Mrs. Scum!
   -- ``''
   
 [End of Act One.  Time: 6:24]

 While Sideshow Bob and Selma sing at the karaoke bar at the Happy Sumo,
 we are treated to a montage of their romance.  They take a paddleboat
 ride in the SNPP runoff lake.  They go for a walk along the beach.
 They dance ridiculously through a field of flowers.  Sideshow Bob rubs
 Selma's feet and pumices her corns.  Selma lets Ralph Mellish pass his
 drivers license eye test (even though he gets it wrong).
   
   We now return to the 27th Annual Krusty the Clown Telethon for Motion Sickness.
   -- ``''
   
 The latest total is displayed.
   
   I love you people!  I love my kids!  [indicates]
   Poor little guys.  So tragic.  So nauseous.  You should see the bus they
   came to the studio in!
   -- Krusty hosts his Telethon for Motion Sickness, ``''
   
 Krusty introduces the ``Chairman of the Company'', who says there's an old
 friend backstage.  Sideshow Bob comes out on stage, and the two hug.
   
   Sideshow Bob: Krusty, can you ever forgive me for framing you and putting
           you in jail?
   Krusty: Hey, if they ever open the books on this telethon, I'm right back
           in there!
   -- Telethon for Motion Sickness, ``''
   
 Bart and Lisa watch the telethon, and Bart's mistrust of Sideshow Bob
 continues.  Krusty kicks Sideshow Bob in the butt.  ``Oh, Krusty, I
 can't tell you how much [kick] I missed this.''

 Marge, Homer, Selma and Sideshow Bob sit at the kitchen table.
   
   Marge: Now, about your wedding dress.  Mmm, I'm not sure how to put this...
   Selma: White!
   Marge: [writing] White.
   -- ``''
   
 As for appetizers, Homer suggests...
   
   Homer: You can't go wrong with cocktail weenies!  They taste as good as
          they look, and they come with this delicious red sauce.  It
          looks like ketchup.  It tastes like ketchup.  But brother, it
          ain't ketchup!
   Sideshow Bob: Well, Selma, he makes a good case.
   -- Catering the wedding, ``''
   
 Selma says they can get whatever they want.  ``All tastes like styrofoam
 to me.''  Selma explains that, when she was a kid, a bottle rocket
 accidentally shot up her nose.  ``I permanently lost my sense of taste
 and smell.''
   
   This wedding is spinning out of control.  Can we really afford it?
   I've already run through eight of the ten dollars they gave me when
   I left prison.
   -- Sideshow Bob, ``''
   
   Hey, relax.  I told you, I got money.
   I bought stock in a mace company just before society crumbled.
   -- Selma, ``''
   
   I just hope people don't think I'm marrying you for your money.
   Instead of your... less tangible qualities.
   -- Sideshow Bob to Selma, ``''
   
 Bart continues to eye Sideshow Bob suspiciously.

 Sideshow Bob and Selma kiss in a horse-drawn carriage, then Selma glances
 at her watch and yells, ``Holy frijoles!  We've got ten minutes to
 MacGyver!''
   
   Selma: Driver, here's a fin.  Get me home and don't spare the whip!
   Barney: [the carriage driver]  Whatever you say, Mum! [belch]
   -- For that added romantic touch, ``''
   
 Selma rushes home, having missed the beginning of MacGyver.  Sideshow Bob
 is disappointed that he's not the only man in her life.  Time passes.
   
   Man:      Thank you, Senor MacGyver.  You've saved our village.
   MacGyver: Don't thank me.  Thank the moon's gravitational pull.
   -- Watching television, ``''
   
   Selma: That MacGyver's a genius.
   Sideshow Bob: First of all, he's not a genius.  He's an actor.
          And second, he's not &lt;much&gt; of an actor.
   Selma: [refusing to believe]  You're lying!  You're lying!
   Sideshow Bob: No, Selma.  &lt;This&gt; is lying.
          [puts on an absurd smile]
          That was a well-plotted piece of nonclaptrap that never
          made me want to retch.
   -- Telling it like it is, ``''
   
 Selma storms out in tears.

 Marge tries to calm down Selma in the Simpsons living room.  Bart is
 pleased that this means the wedding is off.  Sideshow Bob tiptoes in.
   
   Sideshow Bob: Selma, I don't know what to say...
   Selma: Just tell me you like MacGyver.
   Sideshow Bob: Very well, I... I... [breaks down]
          I can't do it!  Even that car chase seemed tacked-on!
   -- A critical eye, ``''
   
   Homer: I hate all the programs Marge likes, but it's no big deal.
          You know why?
   Selma: No.
   Sideshow Bob: Go on.
   Homer: Whenever Marge turns on one of her ``non-violent'' programs,
          I take a walk.  I go to a bar, I pound a few, then I stumble
          home in the mood for looooove. [puts his hand on Marge's lap]
   Marge: [smiles, takes his hand]
   -- Meeting halfway, ``''
   
 Sideshow Bob decides to take Homer's advice, and the two reconcile.
   
   Bart no like.  Bad medicine.
   -- Bart expresses his disapproval, ``''
   
 Maggie proves an adorable (although poorly-balanced) flower girl at the
 wedding.
   
   Lisa: [bitterly] &lt;I&gt; could've been the flower girl.  And I wouldn't keep
         falling down, either.
   Bart: Hey, they chose Maggie, okay?
   Lisa: Yeah, well, if you want to go for cutesiness instead of competence, fine.
   -- Selma's wedding, ``''
   
 Reverend Lovejoy performs the ceremony.  As Sideshow Bob turns to say,
 ``I do'', Bart sees his face turn into the Grim Reaper.

 At the wedding reception, Moe and Barney greet a champagne tray.  Moe
 takes the glass.  Barney takes the bottle.  Meanwhile, Homer surrounds
 himself with hors d'oeuvres trays.  Patty quietly complains, ``I'm the
 only single girl left in the family.''  She spots Homer gorging himself.
 ``Well, I guess it could be worse.''
   
   Marge:  [wielding a camcorder at Selma's wedding reception]
           Ooh, there's Krusty the Clown.  Krusty, Krusty, say something funny!
   Krusty: Oh, gee, a joke.  Um... Um... Uh, funny, uh, okay.  Uh,
           this guy walks into a bar and takes out a tiny piano and a
           twelve-inch pianist.  Oh hoho, no, wait!  I can't tell &lt;that&gt; one!
   -- ``''
   
 At cake-cutting time, Sideshow Bob makes a brief speech, and Selma announces
 that, on the advice of her new husband, she's giving up smoking.
 Except after meals and after MacGyver.  Bart remains suspicious.

 Bart asks Chief Wiggum if he trusts Sideshow Bob.  Chief Wiggum reassures
 Bart that Sideshow Bob wouldn't try anything while he's around.  He
 then asks himself, ``Now where did I put my gun?''  He spots it next to
 the wedding cake.  Some children take slices of cake lying only inches
 away from the gun.

 It's rice-throwing time, and Selma and Sideshow Bob drive off.  All wave
 good-bye, except for Bart, who continues to scowl.

 That evening, Sideshow Bob drives down the highway as Selma sleeps on his
 shoulder.  ``That's right, dear.  Enjoy your rest.  The wedding was very
 tough on you.  And the honeymoon is going to be... murder...''  His evil
 laugh echoes into the darkness.

 [End of Act Two.  Time: 14:35]

 At home, the family watch a videotape of Selma's honeymoon suite
 at Shelbyville Falls.  (``Hey, and after we watch this, we can tape over
 it!'' notes Homer.)  The camera pans to Sideshow Bob roughing up the
 bellhop for not giving them a room with a fireplace.  He then spots
 the camera and smiles.

 Apparently, Sideshow Bob's complaining paid off.  He lights the fire,
 with the aid of the natural gas starter.
   
   Ah, fire!  Scourge of Prometheus!  Toaster of marshmallows!
   [evilly] Eradicator of deadwood...
   -- Sideshow Bob lights the fireplace, ``''
   
 Sideshow Bob suggests Selma shut off the camera.  Selma, lying in bed,
 rips off the covers.  ``And make love?''  Sideshow Bob replies, resigned,
 ``I suppose so.''  The videotape ends.

 Back home, Bart wonders why Sideshow Bob would get so upset over a fireplace.
 Marge explains that he wants the honeymoon to be romantic.  ``Romantic?
 With Aunt Selma?''

 While Selma moans with delight, Sideshow Bob rushes frantically into the
 bathroom, scrubs himself, and splashes water on his face.  He says to
 himself, ``Even murder has its ugly side.''  Selma calls, ``Bob, would
 you mind rubbing my feet?''  Sideshow Bob shudders...  He returns.
 ``Darling, you make it sound like such a chore!''
   
   Sideshow Bob: [rubbing Selma's feet] [quietly]  Soon I will kill you...
   Selma:  What?
   Sideshow Bob: Son pied sent il beau.
           French for ``Her foot smells lovely.''
   Selma:  [calms down]  Oh...
   Sideshow Bob: [quietly] Prepare to be murdered...
   Selma:  Huh?
   Sideshow Bob: /eh pah dee meh moo-doo/.
           That's Sanskrit for ``Your toes are like perfume.''
   Selma:  [calms down]  Oh...
   Sideshow Bob: [quietly] Voy a matar a Usted.
   Selma:  Wha?
   Sideshow Bob: That's Spanish for... [quietly] I'm going to kill you...
   -- ``''
   
 Sideshow Bob quickly changes the subject.  It's time to watch MacGyver.
 While Selma sits in her comfy chair, Sideshow Bob carefully places a
 pack of cigarettes next to Selma, then evilly tiptoes across
 the room.  A knob goes *squeak*, then he tiptoes back.  ``Well,
 time for my walk!''  He quietly adds, ``Don't forget to die...''

 Patty stops by the Simpsons house, feeling somewhat lonely.  She asks
 to watch television with them and turns on MacGyver.  The word ``MacGyver''
 echos through Bart's head, then Bart stands and announces, ``Aunt Selma
 has one hour to live!''  Homer responds, ``Hey!  Down in front!''

 Sideshow Bob enjoys a drink by the hotel pool and says, ``Good-bye.''
 There is a tremendous explosion.  Sideshow Bob calmly picks up the
 phone and frantically reports a terrible accident in his room.

 Sideshow Bob returns to the exploded room (singing, ``Then I went and
 spoiled it all by doing something stupid like explode you'') as he
 approaches Selma's TV chair.  He spins it around, to find Bart sitting
 in it.  ``Sideshow Bob, I'm afraid the only victims here are the good
 people of Best Western Hotels.''  Sideshow Bob is understandably shocked
 to find Bart, as well as Selma, very much alive.
   
   You tried to kill me.  I want a separation.
   -- Selma to her husband of nary a few days Sideshow Bob, ``''
   
 Sideshow Bob finds himself surrounded by police.
   
   My best-laid plans have gang agley!
   -- Sideshow Bob, poetic to the end, ``''
   
   Bart:   Chief Wiggum, think you have room in your jail for a two-time loser?
   Wiggum: Well, no, frankly.  But that never stopped us before.
   -- Sideshow Bob, foiled again, ``''
   
   Sideshow Bob: Bart, I must know.  How did you untangle my web?
   Chief Wiggum: Yeah, Bart, pull us in!
   Bart:         Well, I'd hate to tell the number one cop in town how to do
                 his job...
   Chief Wiggum: No no, please.  It's the only way I'll learn.
   -- ``''
   
 Bart explains.  He realized that the reason Sideshow Bob got so frantic
 over a measly fireplace was for the natural gas.  Surely anyone would have
 smelled a gas leak---except Selma.  While she watched MacGyver, the room
 filled with gas, and the spark from her post-MacGyver cigarette would set
 it off.
   
   Her only hope was a plucky young boy and his slow-witted father.
   -- Bart the Hero, ``''
   
 After trying four times to explain it to Homer, Bart explained it to
 Marge, who understood immediately, and the family mobilized.
   
   To the Simpson-Mobile!
   -- Homer, ``''
   
 With a burst of flame, the Simpson-Mobile speeds off for Shelbyville.
 In her room, Selma prepares to light her cigarette, but Bart storms in
 and stops her just in time.

 But why, then, did the room explode?  Chief Wiggum and his men celebrated
 their success by smoking cigars in the hallway.  Chief Wiggum's carelessly
 discarded match ignited the gas.  Sideshow Bob is taken away.
   
   I'll be back.  You can't keep the Democrats out of the White House forever.
   And when they get in, I'm back on the street!  With all of my criminal buddies!
   Ba-ha-ha-ha-ha!!
   -- Sideshow Bob, ``''
   
   There was one little boy who never lost his mistrust.
   -- Marge, on Bart's unraveling of Sideshow Bob's murderous plan,
      ``''
   
 Bart tells an incredibly feeble joke, and everyone chuckles endlessly.

 EPISODE TITLE: The Otto Show


EPISODE SUMMARY: 


 Bart (wearing a Spinal Tap T-shirt) tells Homer to hurry up.  Marge sweetly
 notes that this is Bart's first heavy-metal concert.  Homer comes down
 the stairs, amazed that his old jacket still fits him.  He finds a can
 of Billy Beer in the pocket, and drinks it.
   
   I hope the Spinal Taps [sic] don't play too loud.
   -- Marge's motherly concern, ``''
   
 Homer responds, ``Oh, Marge.
 I went to thousands of heavy-metal concerts, and it never hurt me.''
 Marge's response is drowned out by the ringing in Homer's ears.  The
 two leave.

 In the car, Homer and Bart catch a news item about Mayor Quimby honoring
 ``the aging supergroup'' in a ceremony at City Hall.  The announcers then
 make an incredibly stupid pun.  The car skids to a halt, and Milhouse
 hops in, wearing a leather jacket of his own, and no shirt.
   
   Bart:     Hey, Milhouse, cool jacket!
   Milhouse: It cost me 50,000 Bazooka Joe comics!
   -- ``''
   
 At the Springfield Coliseum, Homer drops the kids off.
   
   Homer: Now just meet me back here after the show.
   Bart:  Thanks, Dad.  Sure you're not going to be bored?

          back seat of a car!  Heh, heh, heh, heh...

 Bart and Milhouse walk past people hawking T-shirts.
   
   Check it out, Spinal Tap kicking Mohammar Qadaffi in the butt.
   A timeless classic.  Now two for a dollar.
   -- Hawking t-shirts, ``''
   
 Backstage, Bill and Marty of KBBL interview the group.
   
   Fellas, I'm going to hit you with a phrase that has dogged you throughout
   your career.   ``Washed-up.''
   -- Interviewing Spinal Tap, ``''
   
   Here you are, among the top one hundred and five concert acts today.
   What's your secret, guys?
   -- Interviewing Spinal Tap, ``''
   
   We're very big in Bulgaria.  And what-his-name, the other -garia...
   -- Spinal Tap speaks, ``''
   
 In the crowd before the show, a frisbee is tossed about.  Bart accidentally
 hits the fellow next to him with it.  Bart apologizes, but the fellow is
 too stoned to notice.

 Bill and Marty ask Spinal Tap to record some promos for the station, but
 they are reluctant to say ``Nobody rocks like Bill and Marty on KBBL''
 because it might not be true.  ``We don't want to look stupid.''  So they
 agree to say, ``Rock-a-doodle-doo, you're listening to Bill and Marty!''

 The crowd chants, ``Tap!'', while the group complains that there's water
 all over the stage.  The stage manager explains that they're playing in
 what is usually a hockey rink.  ``This is a rock concert, not a bleedin'...
 splish-splash show!''
   
   Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls...  Duff Beer, in association with
   Laramie Cigarettes, is proud to welcome... Spinal Tap!
   -- Rock concert, ``''
   
 The show goes on, although the spotlights don't always stay on their
 intended targets, and the feedback on the audio system is rather
 annoying.  But things pick up.

 Meanwhile, Homer sits in the car, munching on chips and singing along
 with the radio.

 Spinal Tap chat with the crowd, inserting a few gratuitous local references
 to the delight of the crowd.  The next song begins, and giant devil hovers
 overhead.  Then slowly deflates...  Despite the minor setback, ``We salute
 you, our half-inflated Dark Lord!''  The crowd half-heartedly joins in.

 Another chat with the crowd goes awry then the stage hands don't cooperate
 with the lighting.  So they go straight on to the laser show, but cut it
 short when one of the band members gets hit in the eye with a laser beam.
 That's the last straw.  The show ends, after only twenty minutes.
 Otto and Snake are in attendance, and Snake suggests they trash the stage.
 A riot ensues.

 Back in the car, Homer continues to sing along, as police helicopters
 converge on the scene, and officers in riot gear cautiously enter the
 arena.  The riot gets local news coverage.
   
   Tonight, the city weeps, as for the first time ever, a hockey arena
   becomes then scene of violence.
   -- Kent Brockman reports on a concert riot, ``''
   
 Marge hopes her ``poor baby'' is okay, then sees Bart swinging over the
 seats clutching a streamer, which breaks.
   
   Of course, it would be wrong to suggest this sort of mayhem began with
   rock-and-roll.  After all, there were riots at the premiere of Mozart's
   ``The Magic Flute''.  So, what's the answer?  Ban all music?  In this
   reporters opinion, the answer, sadly, is `yes'.
   -- Kent Brockman's two cents, ``''
   
 Bart (his shirt sleeve torn off) arrives with Homer, and Bart announces
 that he wants to be a rock star.  Marge defers the discussion to later.
 She asks if Milhouse is okay, and Homer responds, ``Uh, I'll be right
 back.''  He quickly leaves and drives off.  Back at the arena, Milhouse
 (sans jacket and glasses) lies under a pile of folding chairs.  ``Heeeelp?''

 [End of Act One.  Time: 7:22]

 Marge tucks in Maggie for bed, and she suggests to Homer that they buy
 Bart a guitar since he wants to be a musician.  Homer answers that they
 already have a guitar.  He produces Maggie's toy guitar.  ``I meant
 a &lt;real&gt; guitar.''  ``This is real!''  Homer bangs it on his head to
 prove that the guitar is not a figment of their imagination.

 Marge and Homer present Bart with his own guitar.
   
   Homer: Now, boy, we spent a lot of money, so you'd better get real good
          real fast, or &lt;POW&gt;!
   Marge: Homer!
   Homer: Hey, I thought I was supposed to encourage him.
   -- Feedback of all types, ``''
   
 Bart slips into a daydream.  He's a heavy-metal rocker.
   
   I'd loik to play me latest chaht-toppah.  It's called,
   ``Me Fans Are Stupid Pigs''.
   -- Bart the heavy-metal rock star, ``''
   
 Backstage, Bart is zonked out.  Milhouse says, ``You've changed,
 man!''  Bart throws a glass bottle at him.  Bart lies on the
 floor, complete out of it.  Bart returns to reality.  ``Cool!''

 Bart feebly strums his guitar, while Lisa gleefully plays her sax.  Bart
 tells Lisa to knock it off, but she (teasing) says she was merely jamming
 with him.

 Waiting for the bus, Bart picks at his guitar, and Nelson makes fun of him.
 The bus arrives, and Otto takes the guitar and plays an awesome lick.  The
 kids cheer.
   
   Bart: I didn't know you played the guitar, Otto-Man!
   Otto: Hey, that's all I &lt;did&gt; in high school!
   -- ``''
   
   My old man said I was wasting my time, and I'd never amount to anything.
   He-hah-hah-hah!  He-hah-hah-hah-heh-heh!   [realizes]  Oh...
   -- Otto, ``''
   
 Otto plays another song for his captive audience.  Meanwhile, cars pile
 up behind the bus, since Otto left the red lights blinking.  Martin
 reminds Otto that they were supposed to be at school ten minutes ago,
 and earns the wedgie he feared.
   
   Otto: Uh-oh.  Better fasten your seat belts, little dudes!
   Lisa: We don't have seat belts.
   Otto: Well, then, uh... Just try to go limp.
   -- ``''
   
 The bus speeds off, as the kids scream for their lives.  Otto takes
 a short cut, through the Springfield Tire Yard, running the Spinal Tap
 tour bus off the road (which overturns and catches fire), driving
 through a police picnic.  (None of the policemen catch the license
 plate.  ``I didn't think to look,'' explains Eddie.)  The bus skids
 on its side and comes to halt on (yes, on) the town square, knocking
 over the statue of Jebediah Springfield.  Otto's bumper flies off,
 carrying with it a bumper sticker, ``How's my driving?  Call...''
 Large numbers of townspeople rush for the pay phones.  The kids
 gleefully exit through the emergency door.  (``Whee!'')

 Principal Skinner scolds Otto.
   
   I stand on my record.  Fifteen crashes and not a single fatality.
   -- Otto, ``''
   
 Eddie asks to see Otto's license, but he never got one.  ``But if you
 need proof of my identity, I wrote my name on my underwear.''  Otto
 checks his underwear.  ``Wait, these aren't mine!''
   
   Well, that tears it.  Until you get a [drivers] license and wear your own
   underwear, mister, you are suspended without pay!
   -- Principal Skinner to Otto, ``''
   
 The kids find Principal Skinner behind the wheel.  The kids sing a song
 (not entirely complimentary to the bus driver) and Skinner joins in.
 Skinner waits at a side street for the traffic to clear so he can enter
 the main road, but the traffic is too heavy.  ``I think you have to be
 more aggresive, sir,'' suggests Lisa, but Skinner is sure someone will
 stop to let him in.  No one does.

 At the Springfield Department of Motor Vehicles...
   
   Patty: [laughs spontaneously]
   Selma: What's so funny?
   Patty: I was just thinking about the time Homer got his nose caught in the
          toaster.
   Selma: We'll watch the tape tonight.
   -- ``''
   
 Otto approaches the window.  Patty explains that she will be testing him.
 She grades good deeds with a green pen, errors with a red pen.  ``Any
 questions?''  ``Yeah, one.  Have you always been a chick?''  Patty discards
 her green pen.

 In the parking lot, Otto knocks down cone after cone.  The last one teeters
 for a while before it falls.  Otto cheers, ``Awright!  Yeah!''
   
   You failed every segment, and misspelled `bus' on your application.
   -- Patty administers Otto's driving test, ``''
   
 Skinner has yet to enter the main thoroughfare and has become furious.
 Ralph tries to resume the singing but Skinner snaps at him.

 Otto returns to his apartment, to find something curiously different...
   
   Hey, landlord!  Some clown changed my locks, padlocked the door, and
   put on an eviction notice!
   -- Otto, ``''
   
 Otto hasn't paid his rent.
   
   Otto:     Can I at least get my stuff?
   Landlord: All I found in there was a jar of mustard and a couple of old
             `Psycho' magazines.
   Otto:     Wow!  I have mustard?
   -- Otto gets evicted, ``''
   
 Bart buys a Squishee at the Kwik-E-Mart and agrees to try Apu's
 newly-invented chutney-flavored drink.  Bart takes a sip and
 spits it out, discarding the drink in a nearby dumpster.  We hear
 Otto yell, ``Ow!''
   
   Bart: Otto-Man?  You're living in a dumpster?
   Otto: Ho, man, I wish.  Dumpster-brand trash bins are top-of-the-line.
         This is just a Trash-Co waste disposal unit.
   -- His summer home is the aluminum recycle bin down the street,
      ``''
   
 Bart suggests Otto stay in the Simpsons garage.  ``A garage?  Ho-ho!
 Somebody up there likes me!''  The dumpster lid crashes down on Otto's head.
 Otto's moan echoes...

 [End Act Two.  Time: 14:14]

 At three in the morning, the house rocks awake to the sound of Otto jamming
 on his guitar.  Homer and Marge go down to the garage to find Bart with
 his bus-driving friend.
   
   Marge: What's going on?
   Bart:  Mom, I thought you might forget our little conversation this
          afternoon, so I took the precaution of recording it.
   Marge: What conversation?
   Bart:  [turns on a tape recorder]
   Tape:  [Bart]  ``Mom, can Otto live in our garage for as long as he wants?''
          [bad imitation of Marge]  ``He sure can!''
   Homer: Marge, what were you thinking!
   Marge: That's not my voice!
   Homer: Oh, everybody says that when they hear themselves on tape.
   -- ``''
   
 Homer, Marge, Otto and Bart sit around the kitchen table.  Otto doesn't
 get along with his parents, so he can't stay with them.
   
   Otto:  Please let me stay here.  I've got nowhere else to go!
   Homer: Forget it!  That line didn't work for my dad, and it's not
          going to work for you!
   -- ``''
   
 Bart begs.
   
   Marge: Doesn't the Bible say, ``Whatsoever you do to the least of my brothers,
          that you do unto me''?
   Homer: Yes, but doesn't the Bible also say ``Thou shalt not take... moochers
          into thy... hut''?
   -- ``''
   
   Bart:  Please, Dad?  If you let Otto stay, he'll help around the house and
          chip in a few bucks whenever he can.
   Homer: All right, he can stay.  But I get to treat him like garbage.
   Otto:  Wow!  What's the catch?
   -- The catch is, you have to stay with the Simpsons, ``''
   
 Otto lounges on the couch watching ``The Price is Right''.  Marge tells
 Otto he can't just sit around watching TV, so Otto decides to read a book.
 But the Simpsons don't have anything that suits is fancy.  Marge suggests
 Otto get a job, but Otto explains that the only thing he was good at was
 driving a bus, but ``the man'' demands he get ``a piece of paper''.
 Marge responds, ``So, get that piece of paper!''  Otto complains that he
 tried, but failed.

 Otto plays the guitar in the garage...
   
   Homer: Will you knock it off, I can't hear myself think!
          [the music stops]
          [thinks]  I want some peanuts.
          [aloud]  That's better!
   -- ``''
   
   Homer: Hey, how come you never play your guitar any more?
   Bart:  I'll tell ya the truth, Dad.  I wasn't goot at it right away, so
          I quit.  I hope you're not mad.
   Homer: [sweetly]  Son, come here!  Heh heh heh...
          [Bart sits on Homer's knee]
          Of course I'm not mad.  If something's hard to do, then it's not
          worth doing!  You just stick that guitar in the closet next to your
          short-wave radio, your karate outfit and your unicycle, and we'll
          go inside and watch TV.
   -- ``''
   
 Homer stands in his underwear, banging on the bathroom door.  ``I gotta
 go!''  Otto emerges...
   
   Hey, Poppin' Fresh!  [pokes Homer in the belly]  You're supposed to giggle!
   -- Otto, ``''
   
 ... and Homer finds the sink overflowing, the drain
 clogged by a mat of hair.

 Homer tells Marge Otto must go.  Marge notes that he &lt;is&gt; good with
 the kids...  Upstairs, Otto tells Lisa a scary story, and she screams
 her head off.  This is the last straw for Homer.  ``Listen, you
 drain-clogging, last-cookie-eating, collect-call-getting sponge!
 I want you out of my house!''
   
   Bart: What are you going to do, Otto?
   Otto: Oh, don't worry.  There's plenty of money out there for a guy who
         knows how to fake his own death.
   -- ``''
   
 Marge suggests Otto try the driving test again.
   
   I can't pass that thing.  I got a zero last time.  This time, I'm hung over!
   -- Otto dreads his driving test, ``''
   
   Bart: You can do it, Otto!  You're the coolest adult I ever met!
   Otto: Wow!  I've never been called an adult before. ...
         I've been tried as one, but...
   -- ``''
   
 Otto reads the DMV booklet.
   
   ``Alcohol imcreases your ability to drive.''  [looks up the answer]
   ``False''!?  Oh, man!
   -- Otto studies for his driving test, ``''
   
 Outside the DMV building, Otto admits that Homer was right. ``I &lt;am&gt; a
 bum.''  Bart corrects him.  Homer called him a sponge.  This pushes
 Otto over the edge, and he storms inside.  Otto tells Patty he wants to
 be re-tested.  When asked why, he explains, ``So I can staple my license
 to Homer Simpson's big, bald head!''  Patty changes her demeanor.  ``Here's
 your written test.  I'll get you started.  E, D, C, A, B...''

 In the parking lot, Otto runs over every single cone, but Patty doesn't
 care.  While Otto bad-mouths Homer, he runs over cardboard cut-outs of
 pedestrians, but Patty takes no notice.  She suggests, ``Let's get some
 margaritas, I'm buying.''

 The school bus skids to a halt in front of Springfield Elementary (knocking
 down the `Bus Stop' sign).  Yes, Otto's back behind the wheel.  He
 shows off his drivers license (stamped, ``Probationary'').  The kids pile
 in, and the bus skids off (running a stop sign).  Skinner watches and
 adds, ``Yes.  Hail to the bus driver.  Bus Driver Man.''

 The Gracie theme is played on an electric guitar.

 EPISODE TITLE: Bart's Friend Falls in Love


EPISODE SUMMARY: 

   

 Homer's change jar twinkles atop his dresser.  Bart cautious approaches
 and swipes it.  Homer's rumbling form appears.  ``Why you little...''
 Bart makes his escape through the house, barely exiting through the garage
 door as it closes.  (For that added dramatic touch, he has to reach back
 inside for his lucky red hat.)  He hops aboard the school bus and tips his
 hat good-bye as Homer shouts incoherently.

 Bart takes his seat next to Milhouse, who shows him a `Magic Eight Ball'
 his father bought for him at the Circus of Values.
   
   Bart:     Cool!  An oversized novelty billiard ball!
   Milhouse: Yeah, you shake it up and it tells the future!
   Bart:     Really?
   Milhouse: Uh huh.
   Bart:     [takes it]  Will I pass my English test?  [shakes it]
             [reads]  ``Outlook not so good''.
             Wow, it &lt;does&gt; work!
   -- Ask me no questions, ``''
   
 Milhouse gives it a shot.  ``Will I get beat up today?''  The ball says,
 ``All signs point to Yes.''  Nelson pokes his head over the seat.  ``That
 ball knows everything.''  He slugs Milhouse.  Bart takes the ball and asks
 if he and Milhouse will be friends forever.  ``Don't count on it.''  He
 aims a little lower, but the prognosis is still bleak.  Grasping at straws,
 he asks, ``Will Milhouse and I be friends at the end of the day?''  The
 answer is `No'.  Bart asks, ``What could come between two bestest buddies
 like us?''

 Dramatic close-up of a sweet little girl with braces.
   
   Samantha, I've always been suspicious of transfer students.
   Other principals try to unload problem cases that way.
   Lord knows &lt;I&gt; do...
   -- Principal Skinner welcomes a new student, ``''
   
 Samantha explains that she's a &lt;good&gt; student, but Skinner doesn't believe
 her, momentarily going off in his own world of resentment for his Vietnam
 War service.  He checks her permanent record, which is clean, and notes
 that she beat her bedwetting problem in the second grade.  ``That's in
 there?''  ``Don't worry, they'll forget.''  Skinner lapses again.

 Ms. Krabappel hands out the graded tests, and the Magic Eight Ball was
 right on the money.  Skinner comes in with Samantha.  (Ms. Krabappel
 gripes about the class size.)  Skinner in his usual slip-of-the-tongue
 manner introduces Samantha Stinky (oops, I mean, Stanky).
   
   Ms.K:     I'm sure this is a little scary for you, dear.
   Samantha: Uh huh.
   Ms.K:     So, why don't you stand up in front of the class and tell us about
             yourself.  I'll be grading you on grammar and poise.
   -- Introducing a new student, ``''
   
 Samantha explains that her father owns a home security company and moved
 the family from Phoenix to Springfield because of its high crime rate and
 lackluster police force.  She also notes the weird smell of the town.
 Ms. Krabappel tells her she'll get used to it after six weeks.

 At lunchtime in the schoolyard, Bart offers Milhouse a Wet Willie.  Bart
 licks his finger and sticks it into Milhouse's ear.  (``Victim number
 four!'')  Bart leaves to turn Lewis into his next victim.  A stray ball
 knocks Milhouse's glasses off.  We get a Milhouse's-eye-view of the fuzzy
 world around him as he fumbles for his glasses, threatening the person
 responsible.  He puts on his glasses and sees Samantha standing sweetly,
 ball in hand.  (``Whoa.'')
   
   Class, in order to explain why your hormones will soon make you an easy
   target for [turning bitter] every smooth-talking Lothario with his own car
   and tight jeans... [calms down] I will now show a short sex-education film.
   -- Ms. Krabappel, ``''
   
   Ezekiel and Ishmael, in accordance with your parents' wishes, you may step
   out into the hall and pray for our souls.

   Hello, I'm actor Troy McClure.  You kids might remember me from such
   educational films as ``Lead Paint, Delicious But Deadly'' and ``Here
   Comes the Metric System!''
   -- ``''
   
   I'm here to provide the facts about sex in a frank and straightforward manner.
   And now, here's... ``Fuzzy Bunny's Guide To You-Know-What''...
   -- Troy McClure narrates a sex education film, ``''
   
   This is Fuzzy Bunny.  About a year ago, he noticed his voice was changing,
   he had terrible acne, and had fur where there was no fur before.
   -- Troy McClure narrates a sex education film, ``''
   
 Bart finds the film boring.  Milhouse and Samantha catch each other's eye.
 The movie continues.  Fuzzy and Fluffy courted, but ``never ruined their
 fun by giving in to their throbbing biological urges.''  On their honeymoon
 night...   Cut back to the students watching the film.  The all shout,
 ``Ewwwwwww!''  (Wendell covers his eyes.)
   
   She's faking it.
   -- Ms. Krabappel shows the class a sex education film,
      ``''
   
   Nine months later, Fluffy gave birth to fourteen beautiful bunnies.
   Eight survived.
   -- Troy McClure narrates a sex education film, ``''
   
   And now that you know how it's done...  Don't do it.
   -- Troy McClure narrates a sex education film, ``''
   
 Ms. Krabappel asks if there are any questions.  Nelson asks why she and
 Mr. Krabappel don't live together.  ``Because Mr. Krabappel chased something
 small and fluffy down a rabbit hole.''
   
   Samantha: How do we know when we fall in love?
   Ms.K:     Oh, don't you worry.  Most of you will never fall in love and
             marry out of fear of dying alone.  [chuckles]
   -- ``''
   
   Bart: How would I go about creating a half-man, half-monkey-type creature?
   Ms.K: I'm sorry, that would be playing God.
   Bart: God shmod!  I want my monkey-man!
   -- ``''
   
 The bell rings and the kids stream out of school.  Milhouse approaches
 Samantha.
   
   Milhouse: Uh... That's a nice dress.
   Samantha: My Dad makes me wear it.  I hate it.
   Milhouse: Uh, I hate it, too!
   -- Flexibility in crisis, ``''
   
 Milhouse offers to walk Samantha home, and she accepts.
   
   Everybody on!  No shoving!  Hee, just kidding.  You can shove all you want!
   -- Otto, ``''
   
 Bart tells Otto he can't leave until Milhouse gets on, but Otto has other
 priorities.
   
   My girlfriend's dancing topless at the airport bar.  4:15 to 4:20!
   -- Otto, ``''
   
 The bus speeds off, as Bart sees Milhouse and Samantha out the window.

 Milhouse joins Bart in the treehouse.  He brings Samantha along.
   
   Samantha: Hi.
   Bart:     Hey, what's with the skirt?
   Milhouse: I've brought friends to this treehouse before.
   Bart:     Yeah, but never a girl.  What if I want to strut around nude?
   -- ``''
   
 Bart lets her stay and rummages through his Radioactive Man comics to
 find reading material more suited to the fairer sex.  He finds ``Radioactive
 Man vs. The Swamp Hag''.  Samantha asks after some more traditional
 girl-oriented comics, and Bart offers to get some of Lisa's ``wide
 selection of crappy comics.''

 Bart climbs the tree, comics in hand, holding up a copy of Lisa's
 mushy ``Doomed Romance Comics''.  ``Ewwww.  You guys wanna see something
 gross?''  He spots Milhouse and Samantha kissing.  Gross me out, man.

 [End of Act One]

 ``Tonight on Smartline:  I'm Okay, You're Too Fat''.
   
   Good evening.  Did you know that 34 million American adults are obese?
   Putting together that excess blubber would fill the Grand Canyon two
   fifths of the way up.  That may not sound impressive, but keep in mind
   it is a very big canyon.
   -- Kent Brockman's report, ``''
   
 Disgusted with the choice of viewing, Homer reaches for the remote control,
 but it's barely out of reach.  Rather than get up off the couch, he decides
 to give it another chance.  A dramatization of Santa on a hospital bed,
 two reindeer standing a tearful vigil.  But to no avail.  The doctor
 pulls the sheet over his head.

 Lisa, who is also watching, turns to see Homer's ample belly.  She imagines
 Homer's funeral.  An older Marge, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie (adult, but still
 sucking her pacifier) stand by the grave.
   
   I wish they had never invented fried cheese!
   -- Marge cries at Homer's funeral (in Lisa's dream),
      ``''
   
 Since there wasn't a casket large enough, Homer is buried in a piano
 crate, lowered on a crane into the grave.  The grave diggers rush to
 enlarge the hole, but the chain snaps, crushing everyone.  End of dream.
   
   We take eighteen ounces of sizzling ground beef, and soak it in rich,
   creamery butter, then we top it off with bacon, ham, and a fried egg.
   We call it the Good Morning Burger.
   -- Homer watches a television advertisement, ``''
   
 Lisa resolves, ``I've gotta help him.''

 While Milhouse and Samantha kiss, Bart trades Milhouse's valuable
 baseball cards for his own worthless ones and, hearing no objection,
 concludes the deal.  Samantha checks her watch and says she has to
 leave.  ``My Dad thinks I'm having my braces examined.''  Her parting
 kiss fogs Milhouse's glasses.
   
   Milhouse, we're living in the age of cooties.  I can't believe the risk
   you're running.
   -- Bart, ``''
   
 Bart asks Milhouse what the big deal is about kissing, and Milhouse
 explains.

 Back inside...
   
   We start with pure milk chocolate...
   Add a layer of farm-fresh honey...
   Then we sprinkle on four kinds of sugar...
   And dip it in rich, creamery butter...
   -- The candy bar from hell, ``''
   
   Lisa:  Dad, what if I told you you could lose weight without dieting
          or lifting a finger?
   Homer: I'd say you're a lying scumbag!
   -- You did ask, after all, ``''
   
 Lisa (wielding her copy of Eternity Magazine) suggests Homer use
 subliminal lose-weight tapes to curb his appetite.
   
   Lisa:  They'll send you tapes you listen to while you sleep.
          As you hear New Age music, a powerful message goes to your
          brain telling you to eat less.
   Homer: Lose weight &lt;and&gt; listen to New Age music?  Wow!
   -- ``''
   
 Homer asks Marge's opinion.  She responds, ``Homer, I love you just the
 way you are.''  She then privately asks Lisa for the phone number.

 Marge dials the number, and the operator asks, ``Would you like to lose
 weight, stop smoking, learn the state capitals, master hostage
 negotiations...''  Marge imagines Homer as a hostage negotiator, but
 chooses the weight loss tapes.  The operator types the order into the
 computer.  Over at the warehouse, the order is received via air tube.
 They are out of weight loss tapes, so they send him a vocabulary building
 tape instead.

 Homer is nestled in bed, a set of headphones on his head.  He reminisces
 on the things he and his stomach have done together before going to sleep.
 The tape begins.  ``Hello, this is Dr. Marvin Monroe.  Let's build your
 vocabulary.  A -- Abattoir.  Slaughterhouse.  The cow was slaughtered in
 the abattoir.''

 The next morning, Homer eats several handfuls of bacon.
   
   Marge: Homer, has the weight loss tape reduced your appetite?
   Homer: Ah, lamentably no.  My gastronomic rapacity knows no satieties.
   -- Marge buys vocabulary building subliminal tapes by mistake,
      ``''
   
 From his room, Bart watches Milhouse and Samantha kissing in the treehouse.
 Marge learns of Milhouse's new girlfriend and giggles.
   
   Bart:  All they do is kiss.
   Marge: How cute!  [turns to leave, then catches herself]
          They don't open their mouths, do they?
   Bart:  No.
   Marge: How cute!
   -- Both feet on the ground, please.  ``''
   
 Boarding the school bus, Bart sees Milhouse and Samantha kissing, so he
 reluctantly takes the empty seat next to Martin.  Martin is ecstatic.
   
   This is the first time anyone has ever sat next to me since I successfully
   lobbied to have the school day extended by twenty minutes!
   -- Martin, ``''
   
 Bart explains he's looking for a friend who won't leave him for a girl,
 and Martin eagerly accepts.  (And announces the fact for all to hear.)

 In his room, Martin offers to play the lute for Bart.  He does so (and
 sings along), as we see Bart escaping out the front door.

 In bed, Marge asks Homer why the tapes aren't working, but Homer responds,
 ``Here in the boudoir, the gourmand metamorphosizes [sic] into the
 voluptuary!''  Marge doesn't understand.  Homer kisses her.  Now
 she understands...

 Another absurd Itchy and Scratchy cartoon, this one with a marriage theme.
 Bart laughs uproariously, but Milhouse and Samantha don't share his
 assessment.

 At the Googolplex Theaters, Bart, Milhouse and Samantha watch a Space Mutant
 movie.  Bart chows down on popcorn and soda.
   
   Wow, that really took my mind off those awful transforming space mutants.
   -- Man to woman in bed, ``''
   
 The woman in question metamorphosizes into a space mutant.  Milhouse and
 Samantha scream, then kiss.  Bart sees them and says, ``D'oh!''

 Afterward, Bart suggests they go spit on Skinner's car, but Milhouse
 says, ``There's such a thing as spending &lt;too&gt; much time together.''
 Bart answers, ``I'm tired of watching you two lip-wrestle.  There are
 plenty of other ways to be grossed out in this town.''  Bart storms into
 an alley, where he starts to cry.  Milhouse pops in.  He asks if they
 can still use his treehouse, for ``if her father catches us, he'll
 kill her!''  Bart grants his permission and laughs evilly.

 [End of Act Two]

 As Homer raids the fridge for ``a sextet of ale'', Bart calls Mr. Stanky...

 Mr. Stanky catches Samantha and Milhouse kissing and lets out a prolonged
 ``Noooooooooooooo!''  Ravens flee from the tree.
   
   Mr.Stanky: Samantha, you're my little girl, and sometimes my imagination
              runs away with me.  Just, just tell me what happened.
   Samantha:  Well, Milhouse and I...
   Mr.Stanky: That's enough!
   -- Guilt by association, ``''
   
 Mr. Stanky will put Samantha in an all-girls school.  Milhouse and Samantha
 call out to each other as Mr. Stanky puts his daughter in the car and
 drives away.
   
   How could this happen?
   We started out like Romeo and Juliet, but it ended up in tragedy.
   -- Milhouse, ``''
   
 In the morning, Lisa wakes up Homer (listening to the vocabulary tape)
 noting that it's been two weeks since they bought the tape.  Homer gets
 on the scale... and he's gained 13 pounds.  Homer angrily (and with
 a heavy dose of polysyllabics) discards the tapes.

 Chuck and Ralph comment on Milhouse's current state.
   
   Lisa: Hey, Bart, according to this magazine, in another million years,
         man will have another finger.  [shows an artist's conception
         of a five-fingered hand]
   Bart: Five fingers?  Ewwww!  Freak show!
   -- Only for some, ``''
   
 Bart needs some advice, but Marge isn't home.  He tried talking to Homer,
 but couldn't understand him.  Lisa notes that, although there is a chemical
 under development that can be used to eliminate guilt, the only solution
 given the state of modern technology is to confess.

 Mrs. Van Houten thanks Bart for coming and shows him to Milhouse's room,
 where he finds Milhouse crying on his bed.  Bart confesses, and the two
 fight.  Mrs. Van Houten pops in and is pleased.  ``Milhouse is out of
 bed and full of beans!''  Mr. Van Houten is also pleased.

 In the struggle, Bart reaches for a weapon.  He passes over a pair of
 scissors, a broken glass bottle and a brick, settling on the Magic Eight
 Ball, with which he coshes Milhouse (breaking the ball in the process).

 Back in the Simpsons kitchen, Homer searches the drawers...
   
   Homer: Marge, where's that...  metal deely... you use to... dig... food...
   Marge: You mean, a spoon?
   Homer: Yeah, yeah!
   -- It was on the tip of my tongue, ``''
   
 Homer uses the spoon to gorge on chocolate ice cream.

 Bart and Milhouse pay a visit to Saint Sebastian's School for Wicked Girls.
   
   Bart:     How are we going to find her?
   Milhouse: She said she'd be wearing a plaid jumper.
   -- Paying a visit to Saint Sebastian's School for Wicked Girls,
      ``''
   
 They spot her, and Milhouse presents Samantha with a ten-gallon tub of
 gummy bears.  He hands it over to her, but it's so heavy, she can't hold
 it.  (*thud*)
   
   Bart:     Hey, Samantha, I'm sorry about getting you thrown in the
             penguin house.
   Samantha: That's all right, Bart.  I love Saint Sebastian [School].
             It's run by a group of French-Canadian nuns.
             They're very nice, except they never let me ewt.
   -- ``''
   
 A nun sings in French and says, ``Samantha, ne pas de boys.''  The bell
 rings, and Samantha must return to class.  Milhouse puckers up, but
 Samantha says, ``I'd better not.  It's fifty rosaries a kiss.''  But she
 gives in.  ``What the heck!''  Bart and Milhouse leave.  ``Bart, think
 I can ever find another one like her?''  ``You're asking the wrong guy,
 Milhouse.  They all look alike to me.  Now let's go whip donuts at old
 people.''

 Quick flashcard of ``Professor Homer'' giving a vocabulary lesson.

 Reviews


Karl Wagenfuehr {kw}:  Truly amoung the superior endeavors undertaken by
our laudable Simpsons concoctors -- highest accolades!

Ted Frank {thf}:  Pretty solid, though not one of the all-time greats.

Lawrence Schwimmer {las}:  Good episode!  True, the two plotlines didn't
meld together, but well-done nonetheless.

Alan J Rosenthal {ajr}:  I'd rate this in the middle-to-high range.
Quite good, but not one of the top ones.

J. D. Baldwin {jdb}:  All in all, an excellent episode.

Scott Amspoker {sa}:  I laughed out loud a lot more than usual.
The kind of episode that keeps me coming back for more.

Yours Truly {rjc}:  ``Best of show'' award goes to Milhouse's ``We started
out like Romeo and Juliet, but it ended up in tragedy.''  A close second
was ``She said she'd be wearing a plaid jumper.''

 Historical

    At St. Sebastian's, a nun dances past singing ``Dominique''.
    Al Wesolowsky {abw} explains that this is a reference to Soeur
    Sourire (``Sister Smile''), a Belgian nun who could play the
    guitar and sing, and was `discovered' after she performed on a
    local TV talent show.  ``Dominique'' was a monster single in Europe
    and the U.S., hitting the top of the charts in 1965.  (No mean feat,
    considering it was an album of religious children's songs sung in
    Belgian French.)  Alas, she fell prey to emotional disorders and
    left the order after a few years and fell into obscurity.

 Just before Milhouse comments on Samantha's dress, a student walks past

   holding a notebook, on which is drawn a heart with the inscription
   ``RW + JS''.  Any guesses?

 Madonna was rumored to have been the first choice for Samantha.

   Kimmy Robertson played Lucy on ``Twin Peaks''.

 Itchy's clerical garb


Ted Frank @{thf} clarifies that Itchy is not dressed as a rabbi, but
rather as a priest, noting the white clerical collar.  The hat (which
is similar to a priest's hat from the Mediterranean) was a red
herring.  Ted notes that the only Jewish sect that wear such hats are
the Hasidim, and Scratchy's ceremony was far from Hasidic.

 EPISODE TITLE: Brother, Can You Spare Two Dimes?


EPISODE SUMMARY: 

[Syndication times are enclosed in curly braces {} and come courtesy
of Frederic Briere.]

At the plant physical, dozens of man stand in line with their 
underwear. Lenny steps up stark naked -- turns out he forgot the 
physical was today.  He asks to borrow Homer's, and he refuses.

Tester: This can't be right.  This man has 104% body fat!
	 [turns to Homer] Hey, no eating in the tank!
 Homer: [with a chicken drumstick] Go to hell.
-- Homer's tremendous size, "?"

Homer returns home:

Marge: How was your day at work, dear?
Homer: Oh, the usual.  Stand in front of this, open that, pull down
       this, bend over, spread apart that, turn your head that way,
       cough.
-- The usual day, eh?, "?"

Meanwhile, Smithers and Burns discover that Homer Simpson is sterile,
and that radiation from the plant is the reason. Smithers says that
Homer could sue for millions.  Burns asks for his lawyers. With them
assembled in Burns' office, he talks to them:

 Burns: Now before we begin, let me make one thing clear for you. I 
	want your legal advice.  I even pay for it.  But to me you're 
	all vipers!
	You live on personal injuries, you live on divorces, you live 
	on pain and misery! I-- 
	 [getting ahold of himself] 
	Oh, but I'm rambling. Would anyone like some coffee?
Lawyer: Yes, I would like some coffee.
 Burns: Want it black, don't you?  Black like your heart?  It's so 
	hard for me to listen to you, I hate you all so much! 
	 [pause] 
	I'm sorry, it's my problem, I'll deal with it.  Please 
	continue.
Lawyer: If you offer Homer Simpson a token cash settlement, say a 
	couple of thou, he'll be so dazzled, he'll sign anything you 
	shove under his nose.
 Burns: [sarcastic] Oh, brilliant, a cash settlement.  I could have 
	figured that out, you buttoned-down maggot!
Lawyer: Got any cream?
 Burns: Oh yes, of course, where are my manners?
-- Burns' anti-lawyer rant, "?"

Meanwhile, below the poverty line, Herb Powell (Homer's half brother) 
has become a bum.

Yeah, I used to be rich.  I owned Mickey Mouse Massage Parlors.  Then
those Disney sleazeballs shut me down.
-- A bum, "?"

I used to own a successful car company. My secret was giving them 
Japanese names.
-- Herb Powell, "?"

Herb: Any of you guys ever drive a Tempura Hatchback?
 Bum: Hey, I got hit by one of those!
-- "?"

Then Herb relates his tale of finding out he had a half-brother, in 
clips from 7F16 that relate the story.

Forbes called it the blunder of the century.  A bit overblown, don't
you think? What about New Coke?
-- Herb, talking about the car Homer designed,
     "?"

 Herb: This is America, and in America, you're never finished as long
       as you have a brain in your head, because all a man really
       needs is an idea.
Bum 1: Well, I'm licked.
Bum 2: Me too.
-- "?"

Meanwhile, at the Simpson house:

And now, the next event in our Living Room Olympics, the always
controversial Couch Vault.  [gruff voice] I do this for Stainmaster
carpets, proud sponsor of the Living Room Olympics.
-- Bart announces the Living Room Olympics,
     "?"

To Olympics-knockoff music, Bart vaults using a broom, doesn't make 
it, and causes the couch to collapse, just as Homer walks in.

The dream is over!
-- Homer laments the fate of the couch,
     "?"

Homer: All right, who did this?
 Bart: We were just sitting on the couch quietly chatting when we heard
       a creaking noise.
 Lisa: We leapt off just in time to see it collapse.
	[puts her head on Bart's shoulder]
 Bart: There, there, you're safe now, little sister.
-- "?"

Why did this have to happen now during prime time, when TV's brightest
stars come out to shine?
-- Homer laments the fate of the couch,
     "?"

Homer recalls the "great memories" of him and the couch:  Kristie
confessing she shot J.R., Hands Across America, and Gomer Pyle
(Shazam!)

Well, friend, you're going back where you came from... the curb in
front of Flanders' house.
-- Homer laments the fate of the couch,
     "?"

Herb stands in a public park trying to figure out an idea, when a
woman struggles to understand what her baby's trying to tell her.

Herb: [confronting her] Lady, you just gave me the idea of a 
      lifetime!  How do I thank you?
Lady: Please don't hurt me.
Herb: Consider it done.
-- There's gratitude for 'ya, "?"

Homer is called into Burns' office...

   Burns: [whispering] This is the man with the lazy sperm?
Smithers: Mm hmm.
   Burns: Ah, Simpson, you big virile son of a gun!
-- "?"

Burns offers Homer a check for $2,000. All he has to do is sign this
form.

Wait a minute, I'm not signing anything until I read it, or someone 
gives me the gist of it.
-- Homer, "?"

Burns explains hastily that Homer has won the First Annual Montgomery
Burns Award for Outstanding Achievement in the Field of Excellence.
(He says the last word like he normally says "Ex-cellent!" Homer 
agrees to sign it, but only with a big awards ceremony and a trophy.
The lawyer has to agree.

The Bonita DeWolf &amp; her Nuclear Plant Soft Shoe Society sing the
song for the FAMBAFOAITFOE, which is simply the name of the award
with "It's the" tacked on.

Lisa: This show is the biggest farce I ever saw!
Bart: What about the Emmys?
Lisa: I stand corrected. 
-- Lisa and Bart, chattin' it up, "?"

Burns introduces Smokin' Joe Frazier...

[reading off a teleprompter] Webster's dictionary defines excellence 
as "the state or condition of being excellent."  And now, the winner 
of the First Annual Montgomery Burns Award for Outstanding 
Achievement in the Field of Excellence...
-- Smokin' Joe Frazier, "?"

Homer: [crossing fingers] Please, please, please, please, please!
 Lisa: Dad, you know you won!
Homer: Don't jinx it!
-- "?"

Of course, Homer won. He cheers for himself and kisses Marge before
falling off of his balcony seat.

[End of Act I.  Time: 7'11" {6'47"}]

In Moe's Tavern... 

Joe Frazier: Keep those pig legs coming, Moe.
	Moe: You cleaned me out, Smokin' Joe.
-- "?"

Moe and Joe Frazier try to comfort Homer about his loss of couch.

Homer, I know how you feel.  You lost the couch. I lost the heavyweight
championship.
-- Smokin' Joe Frazier, "?"

Heavyweight championship?  There's like three of those.
-- Homer, "?"

"This couch was one of a kind." Frazier consoles him, but Barney 
tells Joe to shut up. They take it outside, and Barney gets his ass
kicked. Homer takes a walk...

All right, a peanut! [eats it]
-- Barney, trashcanned, "?"

Back under the railroad, Herb talks to his fellow bums...

Herb: All a man needs is an idea.
 Bum: Then how come you're still a bum?
-- Good point, "?"

A man needs two things: an idea, and money to get it off the ground.
-- Herb Powell, "?"

But then he discovers Homer Simpson won the FAMBAFOAITFOE through a
newspaper on a bum's head. After finding out which train goes to
Springfield, Herb stows away on a pillow train.

Meanwhile, Homer mopes about.

I feel so empty, so alone, so... couchless.
-- Homer laments the fate of his couch, 
     "?"

He discovers the Spine-Melter 2000. Trying it out, Homer asks for 
full power and is pulled into a 2001 style dream sequence. Homer 
wants to take it, but Marge finds out it costs $2000.

There's an empty spot I've always had inside me. I tried to fill it
with family, religion, community service, but those were dead ends.
-- Homer discovers his new couch, 
     "?"

Homer thinks the chair is the answer, but Marge convinces him not to
buy it.  So he sticks around trying out the chair some more.

Herb is at the place -- he sees two adjoining house, one clean and 
one messy. He chooses the clean one. He rings the doorbell, and it
plays "A Mighty Fortress is Our God". Got a feeling he had the wrong
house.

 Ned: [answering the door] Yes?
Herb: Oh, I'm sorry, I must have the wrong house.
 Ned: Oh, that's where you're wrong, friend.
-- Herb pays a visit, "?" 

Herb's in luck -- today's Tithe Day at the Flanders and they got a
transient.

Todd: Dad, can I anoint the sores on [Herb's] feet?
 Ned: No, I think it's Mom's turn, son.
Todd: Aw, no fair.
-- Goody two-shoes family, "?" 

They clean up Herb and give him a suit.

If you ever want to sleep over, Maude and I can sleep on card tables.
-- Ned Flanders, "?" 

Todd starts "Onward, Christian Soldiers" and the whole family joins 
in.  Homer, sitting on his collapsed couch, covers his ears.

Oh, they're singing again.  Lousy neighbors, wish I was deaf.
-- Homer, "?" 

The doorbell rings. Herb waits outside.

	[at the door]
 Herb: What am I going to say?  This is the guy who ruined me. But
       on the other hand, he's family. So many conflicting emotions,
       how to express them?
	[Homer answers the door.]
Homer: Herb? 
	[Herb punches him out]
-- There's a good way, "?" 
  
Herb walks over Homer's body and is greeted by Bart and Lisa. Homer 
laments,  "You weren't so happy to see me."

 Herb: Every word you say just makes me want to punch you in the 
       face!
Homer: Well, while you're a guest in my home, could you just kick me
       in the butt?
 Herb: I'll try, but I'm not making any promises.
-- "?" 

Marge greets Herb with equal surprise as everyone else.

Marge: Herb! How have you been?
 Herb: Well, I've been living in a cardboard box, sleeping on grates,
       eating out of dumpsters.  You?
Marge: Hmm, can't complain.
-- "?" 

Homer gives Herb the grand tour, including how to work a light 
switch.  He doesn't know what it does (it strikes up a Christmas roof
light show meant for 1985.) They eat dinner.

Bart: Unckie Herb, what advice would you give to a young boy who
      would most likely become a bum like yourself?
Herb: Discarded pizza boxes are an inexpensive source of cheese.
-- "?" 

Lisa: Why didn't you write, Unckie Herb?
Herb: Hey, if I wrote to you, what was I supposed to say? "Dear
      Lisa, last night I used a rat for a pillow, thanks to your 
      pop?"
-- "?" 

Herb lets Maggie in on a secret: she's going to make him rich again.
Inappropriate onimous music plays. Later, the family plays Monopoly.
Herb's turn:

Herb: [rolls a 3] Ventnor Avenue.
Lisa: And while on Ventnor Avenue, you'll be staying at the fabulous
      Hotel Lisa. A valet will be around shortly to park your 
      thimble.  Of course, there is the unpleasant matter of the 
      bill.
Herb: Get to the point.
Lisa: 1150 bones.
-- "?" 

Herb pays him the money, and he's bankrupt. "Just like in real life,"
laughs Homer. "I guess you're just not much of a businessman." Herb 
punches him.

Why are we playing games when we got two grand in the bank? Remember
when Homer won the Montgomery Burns Award for Outstanding Acheivement
in the Field of Excellence?
-- Bart (whuzzuh)?, "?" 

Lisa thinks the money should be invested in the Greater Books of the
Western Civilization. Homer reminds Marge she wanted to buy a 
vibrating chair, but Marge retorts: "That was your idea!" Bart has a
different plan on how to spend the money:

I think we should get a machine gun. We can use it to hunt game, spell
out things, or ring in the New Year!
-- Bart, "?" 

Marge thinks the money should be spent on a new washer and dryer. (A
scene of the shaking machines about to crush Snowball II proves her
point.)

 Herb: How would you like to spend $2,000 to give a broken man a
       second chance?
Homer: Nah.
-- Brotherly love, "?"

Herb invites the family in for a presentation that will change the 
world, and brings out a drinking bird. Homer is in awe. Herb tells
him to take it easy, but Homer continues to ogle the bird. Herb
introduces his true plan: a baby translator.

It measures the pitch, the frequency, and the urgency of a baby's cry,
and then tells whoever's around, in plain English, exactly what the
baby's trying to say!  Everything from "Change me" to "Turn off that
damn Raffi record!"
-- Herb explains his baby translator,
     "?"

Herb says that he simply needs $2,000 for research. The whole family
agrees that Homer should give him the money.

Homer: All right, Herb. I'll give you the money, but first you
       have to forgive me and treat me like a brother.
 Herb: Nope.
Homer: All right, then just give me the drinking bird.
-- Homer and the bird, "?"

[End of Act II.  Time: 15'25" {15'01"}]

Herb goes through the various stages of the testing process. After a
long period of research, Herb unveils his creation.

Herb: Now I bet you're all wondering what lies under this sheet.
Bart: Not really.  We snuck a peek while you were in the john.
-- "?"

He reveals his less-than-spectacular creation. Marge "oooh"s. Herb
says "You don't have to humor me", but she retorts that it's pretty
ingrained.  Homer says it's the stupidest thing he ever saw.

Homer: I can't believe we spent $2,000 on this when right now rollers
       could be kneading my buttocks.
 Herb: Homer, would you stop thinking about your ass?!
Homer: I try, but I can't...
-- An ass-obsessed man, "?"

Just then Maggie reveals its ability.

Lavish attention on me, and entertain me.
-- Maggie's first "words", "?"

Everyone is in awe. Lisa plays peekaboo with her.

      Lisa: Maggie? Maggie? [covers her eyes]
    Maggie: [babbles]
Translator: [monotone] Where did you go?
      Lisa: Peekaboo! [uncovers eyes]
    Maggie: [laughs]
Translator: [monotone] Oh, there you are. Very amusing.
-- The side-effects of the translator, 
     "?"

Homer still isn't convinced.

People are afraid of new things. You should have just taken an existing
product and put a clock on it or something.
-- Homer, on the baby translator, "?"

But Marge must dissent. In bed, Homer laments his fate.

I gave Herb all the money I had in the world, and he still treats me
like something he pulled out of his ear.
-- Homer laments his fate, "?"

In the Baby Convention ("Tu-Fr, No Triplets!"), Professor John Frink
unveils his baby airplane, which allows your baby to fly. Frink
demonstrates with his son. But after a "perfect landing" fails, Frink 
is upset. "Oh, no, my wife is going to kill me." Herb's baby 
translator is much more of a success.

I'm rich again! U-S-A! U-S-A!
-- Herb's success with the translator,
     "?"

Herb gives his family several gifts. To Marge, he buys new washer and
dryer, and sold the old ones for $50. At Moe's Tavern, the washer and 
dryer are being raced. Bart gets a membership in the NRA. Lisa gets
a subscription to the Greater Books oof the Western Civilization.

I bet you don't have a vibrating chair in that bag for me.
-- Homer to Herb about his lack of present,
     "?"

Herb invites Homer to walk him to his car. Homer asks what he gets,
unless it's a punch in the face. Herb forgives Homer and allows him
to call Herb "brother", and he can do the same.

 Herb: Give me a hug, brother.
Homer: All right, but I never really hugged a man before.
-- "?"

They hug, and a truck pulls in. "I got you the damn chair!" Homer
multiple-kisses him. At the end of the show, Homer sits in his
vibrating chair with glee, vibrating away. So are his few sperm.

 EPISODE TITLE: Kamp Krusty


EPISODE SUMMARY: 

   

 It's the last day of school.  Bart's report card consists of
 straight D-minuses.  Bart pleads for leniency, since he needs a C
 average in order to go to .  Ms. Krabappell gives in.
 ``Oh, Bart Simpson, I'm gonna miss you.''  The P.A. crackes to life.
 Principal Skinner hopes the kids remember to bring their
 ``implements of destruction.''  They did.
   
   Now let's trash this dump!
   -- Principal Skinner, ``''
   
 For the first time ever, an elementary school becomes a scene of
 havoc and mindless destruction.
   
   Somebody put a torch to these permanent records!  Quickly now!
   -- Principal Skinner, ``''
   
 But it was all a dream...
   
   Bart:  How do I know this isn't some beautiful dream, too?
   Homer: [whacks him on the head with a newspaper]
   Bart:  Ow!  You know, a pinch is more traditional.
   -- A non-traditional family, ``''
   
 The breakfast table is once again the site of much consumption and burping.
 Bart stares at a brochure of ``''.
   
   Marge: Homer, you do remember your promise to the children?
   Kids:  [lean in expectantly]
   Homer: Sure do!  When you're 18, you're out the door!
   -- ``''
   
 The other promise was that if Bart and Lisa got C averages, they
 could go to .  Lisa anticipates no problem fulfilling her
 end of the deal.
   
   Just remember when you see my report card, they've got this whole new
   grading system this year.  It now goes D-B-A-C.
   -- Bart, ``''
   
 Homer is not fooled by this little ruse.
   
   Son, if you really want something in this life, you have to work for it.
   Now quiet!  They're about to announce the lottery numbers.
   -- Homer, ``''
   
 The lottery numbers are read off.
   
   Homer: [holding his lottery ticket]
   Radio: Seventeen.
   Homer: D'oh!
   Radio: Thirty-two.
   Homer: D'oh!
   Radio: Five.
   Homer: D'oh!
   Radio: Eight.
   Homer: Woo-hoo!
   Radio: Forty-seven.
   Homer: D'oh!
   -- ``''
   
 The students empty their lockers into the hallway instead of the
 nearby waste baskets.  Bart opens the combination lock for his
 (36-24-36), and sounds of the jungle escape.  Bart discards assorted
 items.  He finds his gym shorts, stiff as a board.

 In Lisa's classroom...
   
   Here are your final report cards.  I have nothing left to say to any
   of you, so if nobody minds, let's just quietly run out the clock.
   -- Miss Hoover, ``''
   
 Lisa's card of straight A's is marred by a single B-plus in conduct.
 Still in shock, Lisa approaches Miss Hoover.
   
   Now Lisa, everyone needs a blotch on their permanent record.
   -- Miss Hoover dispenses final grades, ``''
   
 Lisa somewhat insistently tries to bring her point across.
 ``Lisa... you're... hurting me!''

 Bart waits impatiently for Mrs. Krabappel to fill out his report
 card.
   
   Mrs. Krabappel, in figuring out my final grades, I hope you'll note
   that all of my textbooks are being returned in &lt;excellent&gt; condition.
   In some cases, still in their original wrappings!
   -- Bart, ``''
   
 Mrs. Krabappel is not swayed.  Bart gets straight D-minuses.  ``Have
 a D-lightful summer.  Ha ha ha.''

 T minus five seconds and counting.  When the bells ring, the
 students stream out the doors, but before they can disappear for
 good, a teacher properly concludes their education.
   
   Teacher: Wait a minute!  You didn't learn how World War II ended!
   Class:   [pause their celebration, awaiting the answer]
   Teacher: We won!
   Class:   Yay!  U-S-A!  U-S-A!  U-S-A!
   -- ``''
   
 As a bunch of rowdy students try to overturn a Volkswagon, Skinner leaves
 Groundskeeper Willie some instructions for the summer.

 The rambunctious bus trip home, being driven by Otto.  (Who else?)
   
   All right!  Three whole months of Spaghetti-O's and daytime T.V.!
   -- Otto enjoys the last day of school, ``''
   
 Lisa and Bart sit together on the bus.  Bart has a diamond cutter's
 monocle in one eye as he performs fine craftwork on his report card.
 He transforms his drab D-minuses into sparkling A-pluses.  Lisa gets
 a good laugh out of Bart's handiwork.  ``Why didn't you at least
 forge &lt;plausible&gt; grades?''

 A Kommercial for  appears on the telly.
   
    is built on an actual Indian burial ground!
   -- No expense left unspared, ``''
   
   For you fat kids, my exclusive program of diet and ridicule will
   really get results!
   --  ``''
   
 And the best part is that you'll spend the summer with Krusty
 himself. ``Honest Injun!''

 Resigned to the inevitable, Bart heads for the backyard, where Homer
 is busy mowing the lawn.  And a hose.  And a roller-skate.  The
 roller-skate jams the rotor.
   
   Bart:  Well Dad, here's my report card.  I think you'll be pleasantly
          surprised.
   Homer: [incredulously]  A-plus?!?  You don't think much of me, do you boy?
   Bart:  [almost proudly]  No sir!
   Homer: You know a D turns into a B so easily.  You just got greedy.
   -- ``''
   
   Bart:  So I won't get to go to camp?
   Homer: [sternly] Now Bart, we made this deal because I thought it
          would help you get good grades.  And you didn't.
          [brightly] But why should you pay for my mistake?
   Bart:  You mean I can go?
   Homer: Yeah.  I didn't want you hangin' around all summer anyway.
   -- That'll learn 'im, ``''
   
 Homer then asks Bart to reach under the mower and pull out the
 skate.  Bart begins to reach in when the motor suddenly coughs to
 life.  ``Nevermind.''

 [End of Act One.  Time: 6:48]

 Marge packs Bart's suitcase and learns of Bart's plans to swim
 ``nekkid''.  Bart explains that the human body is a thing of beauty.
 Homer bursts in and asks Marge if his back is getting harier.  It
 is.

 Lisa pays Dr. Hibbert a visit, asking for a flurry of inoculations.

 The family is seated at the dinner table.
   
   Marge: It's our last family dinner for six weeks.  But I promised myself I
          wouldn't cry.  [the others chow down in a most... vocal way]
   Marge: [crying]  Oh, I'm going to miss this.
   -- ``''
   
 Bart defends his pickle rights by licking the contested comestible.
 Homer responds by dumping the pickle into Bart's milk.  Bart muses
 in admiration, ``Always thinking two moves ahead...''

 A group of parents send off their children as they board the bus for
 .  Martin's father sends his son to ``Image Enhancement
 Camp'', but Martin knows it's ``fat camp for Daddy's chubby little
 secret.''  Marge bids a difficult farewell to Bart and Lisa.
   
   Marge:  Lisa, watch out for Poison Ivy.  Remember,
           ``Leaves of three, let it be.''
   Homer: ``Leaves of four, eat some more!''  Heh heh heh.
   -- Leaves of five, it's a woody deciduous, ``''
   
 The bus and its precious cargo depart.
   
   Bart: Don't look in my closet.  In fact, stay out of my room altogether.
   Lisa: If the pets die, don't replace them, I'll know!
   -- Leaving for... ``''
   
 The parents wistfully watch the bus vanish into the distance.  Once
 it disappears over the horizon, they jump for joy.  (``Don't come
 back!'')

 The bus crosses an unintentionally collapsing bridge on its way to
 the Krustiest Place on Earth.  The children are gathered for
 introductions.
   
   Krusty: [on TV] Hi Kids!  Welcome to !  Hoo huh hoo heh ha heh!
           I'll see you in a few weeks!  Until then, I turn things over to my
           bestest buddy in the whole wide world, [obviously dubbed]
           &lt;Mr. Black&gt;.  I want you to treat &lt;Mr. Black&gt; with the same respect
           you would give me.  Now here's &lt;Mr. Black&gt;.
   -- Welcome to ``''
   
 In fact, the dubbed voice is that of Mr. Black himself, their head
 counselor.
   
   For the past 15 years I was president of Euro-Krustyland... until it blew up.
   -- Mr. Black, ``''
   
 After an exceedingly brief question-and-answer session, in which he
 explains that Krusty &lt;will&gt; be along ``eventually'', he introduces
 the kids to their counselors, Dolph, Jimbo and Kearny.  They peg
 Wendell as a troublemaker.

 At home, Homer lasciviously joins Marge in the shower.

 Jimbo introduces the kids to their cabin.
   
   Here's your cabin.  If you don't like it, T.S.
   -- Counselor Jimbo, ``''
   
 Assorted wildlife escape from the cabin.  But Bart isn't worried,
 for the cabin contains a (grime-covered) Krusty Brand Seal of
 Approval.

 Krusty burns his finger on a clock at the product testing center.
   
   Guy:    Oops!  I should have warned you.  That clock gets &lt;incredibly&gt; hot
           if you leave it plugged in.
   Krusty: That's okay.
   -- Krusty approves his line of licensed products, ``''
   
 He also approves a shelf of obviously dangerous and defective
 merchandise.  ``Now I'm off to Wimbledon!''

 Campfire.
   
   Bart:  Don't we get to roast marshmallows?
   Dolph: Shuddup and eat your pine cone.
   -- When I was a kid, we used to &lt;dream&gt; of roasting pine cones, ``''
   
 Kearny throws another rubber tire on the campfire and douses it with
 petrol.  The next morning, Lisa and several other kids in their
 bathing costumes stand at the edge of a pier, looking down at a
 ragged canoe.
   
   Lisa:   Uh, are your sure that's safe?
   Kearny: Well it ain't gettin' any safer.
   -- ``''
   
 Lisa tries to step in, but the current snaps the mooring.  [In
 the Aussie version, the canoe is smashed to pieces.]

 Meanwhile, at the secure ``Chief Starving Bear Weight Loss Center'',
 a drill sergeant gives his charges (hanging from pull-up bars) a
 rough introduction.

 The campers are gathered to sing the camp song.
   
   \&lt;
   Campers: Hail to thee, ,
    :       By the shores of Big Snake Lake.
    :       Though your swings are rusty,
    :       We know they'll never break.
   Jimbo:   Louder!   Faster!
   Campers: From your gleaming mess hall,     |[a frog leaps out of Lisa's soup]
    :        To your hallowed baseball field, |[Fieldsman Bart falls in a hole]
    :        Your spic-and-span infirmary,    |[disgustingly old nurse lights a]
    :        Where all our wounds are healed. |[match on a kid's plaster cast]
    :        Hail to thee, ,       |[Bart, Milhouse and Lisa run for]
    :        Below Mount Avalanche.           |[cover from falling rocks]
    :        We will always love ,                                  \&amp;
    :        A registered trademark of the Krusty Corporation,                 \&amp;
    :        All rights reserved!                                              \&amp;
   \&gt;
   -- ``''
   
 Shortly thereafter, the bleachers collapse.

 Meal-time.
   
   Lisa:  You're serving us gruel?
   Dolph: Not quite.  This is Krusty Brand Imitation Gruel.  Nine out of ten
          orphans can't tell the difference.
   -- The tenth orphan peeked at the answers, ``''
   
 In Mr. Black's cabin, a lavish feast is underway for just himself and the
 three counsellors.
   
   Gentlemen, [toasts]  To Evil!
   -- Mr. Black, ``''
   
 Back at the Simpsons household, Homer has lost five pounds and is
 growing new hair.  And as we all know, men with hair are friskier in
 bed.

 In their subfreezing cold cabin, the children lie in their bunks
 while the counselors head across the lake to ``meet some tail.''
   
   Lisa: I feel like I'm gonna die, Bart.
   Bart: We're all gonna die, Lis.
   Lisa: I meant soon.
   Bart: So did I.
   -- ``''
   
 [Second Aussie commercial break.  Time 13:01]
 [1.5 seconds longer than the US version.]

 At Wimbledon, Krusty enjoys a bowl of strawberries and cream as he watches
 the tennis match from what we learn to be the Royal Box.  Her Royal
 Highness is not amused.

 Marge writes a letter to Bart and Lisa.
   
   Dear kids, I hope this letter finds you well.  We are doing great.
   Your father is in the best shape he's been since... well, &lt;ever&gt;.
   -- Marge writes a letter to the kids, ``''
   
 Homer does one-armed push-ups on the floor.

 Marge encloses jellybean cookies, to which Kearny helps himself.
 ``Hey Simpson, tell your Mom her cookies &lt;sucked&gt;!''

 Lisa, her hair unkempt, composes her own letter to be sent home.
   
   Dear Mom and Dad.  I no longer fear Hell because I've been to .
   -- Lisa, ``''
   
 ``Our nature hikes have become grim death marches.  Our arts and
 crafts centre is, in actuality, a Dickensian work house.''  To the
 beat of Kerny's drumming, the children sew fake Gucci wallets in
 unison.  The drumming accelerates.

 In the cabin, Bart makes it through the days on the belief that
 Krusty will Kome.

 Draped in a shawl, Lisa slips her letter to a man on horseback who
 accepts a flask of alcoholic beverage as payment.
   
   Save us!  Save us &lt;NOW!&gt;
   -- Lisa's letter home from... ``''
   
 Homer and Marge enjoy the letter.  Marge predicts, ``She complains
 now, but when we go to pick her up, she won't want to leave.''

 The cabin roof is blown away by the strong winds.  Everyone clings
 desperately to avoid being blown away.

 [End of Act Two.  Time 15:09]
 [again, 1.5 seconds longer than the US version]

 Homer and Marge enjoy a picnic.  Marge worries about missing the
 fireworks, but Homer assures her that they have fireworks of their
 own.  He reveals a picnic basket full of, yes, fireworks.

 Mr. Black speaks before the kids.
   
   Well kids, I promised you a little treat in lieu of dinner, and here it is.
   -- An address from Mr. Black, ``''
   
 Their special guest is Krusty the Clown.  But it isn't the real
 Krusty, but rather a fat, dishelvelled Barney in Krude Klown make-up
 and Kostume.  Bart accuses the impostor.
   
   Barney: Yeah Bart, I am so Crunchy the Clown!  [belches]
   -- ``''
   
 Bart is fed up.
   
   I've been scorched by Krusty before.  I got a rapid heartbeat from his
   Krusty brand vitamins, my Krusty Kalculator didn't have a seven or an
   eight, and Krusty's autobiography was self-serving with many glaring
   omissions.  But this time, he's gone too far!
   -- Bart, ``''
   
 He leads the kids in a chant of ``We want Krusty!''  Barney joins
 in, ``We Want Crunchy!  We Want Crunchy!''  Mr. Black and the
 counselors escape to the hydrofoil when the children storm the
 stage.  The Krusty Brand totem pole is torn down.  Bart smashes the
 lock to the ``Image Enhancement Camp''.
   
   My chunky brothers!  Gorge yourselves at the trough of freedom!
   -- Bart frees the inmates of ``Image Enhancement Camp'', ``''
   
 Martin eats the gruel straight from the pot.  Lisa, ever in the
 service of others, distributes the undelivered mail.  Bart hoists
 the black flag of `Camp Bart', despite Lisa's original impression
 that it was to be named ``Camp Freedom''.

 [Third Aussie Commercial break.  Time: 17:22]

 Her Royal Highness is about to knight Krusty, but the ceremony is
 interrupted by an urgent telephone call.  ``Oy gevalt!''

 Homer and Marge exercise to a television yoga class.
   
   Just let your head flop back and forward.
   Your neck is a well cooked piece of asparagus.
   -- Sadrodin Muraradad's Yoga Party, ``''
   
 The program is interrupted by a special bulletin: ``Krisis at ''.
   
   Ladies and Gentleman, I've been to Vietnam, Afghanistan, and Iraq;
   and I can say without hyperbole that this is a million times
   worse than all of them put together.
   -- Kent Brockman, ``''
   
 In the background, Krusty is burnt in effigy.  Kent is granted an
 interview with the ring-leader...
   
   Don't be the boy, don't be the boy...
   -- Homer watches a news report, ``''
   
 It's the boy.  Homer immediately loses his hair and regains his gut.
   
   Bart:  We want the whole world to know that this was a really crappy camp.
          [covers microphone with his hand]  Can I say `crappy' on TV?
   Kent:  Yes, on this network you can.
   -- ``''
   
 Krusty arrives via helicopter and is immediately accosted by the media.
 He punches out a video camera before approaching Bart.
   
   Krusty: I'm no fake!  I'm the real Krusty!
   Lisa:   Oh yeah!?  Who played your daughter in the short-lived sitcom
           `President Clown'?
   Krusty: I don't know her name... but she held up a liquor store last year.
   -- ``''
   
 Bart suspects a trap, and Krusty is stripped of his shirt in search of
 a wiretap.  ``Hey, not the face!''  Lisa confirms his identity,
 observing his pacemaker scar, cattle skull birthmark, and superfluous
 nipple.  Krusty is relieved, ``Well, at least you're not as bad as
 customs.''
   
   How could you Krusty?  [smugly] I'd never lend my name to an inferior product.
   -- Bart ``''
   
   Bart:   Krusty!  This camp was a nightmare!  They fed us gruel, they forced
           us to make wallets for export, and one of the campers was eaten by
           a bear!
   Krusty: [horrified] Oh My God!!
   Bart:   Well, actually, the bear just ate his hat.
   Krusty: Was it a nice hat?
   Bart:   Oh yeah.
   Krusty: [horrified] Oh My God!!
   -- ``''
   
 To make it up to the kids, Krusty personally drives the bus to
 ``the happiest place on earth:  Tijuana!''

 `South of the Border' is performed as we are treated to vacation snaps.
 The singing continues over the credits.

    need wonder
    no longer.   had a few good gags and a lot of potential, but
    it was often predictable and drawn out.  Also, a lot of the animation
    was not up to par (a few scenes were quite well done, though -- like
    Lisa giving the letter).

    Highlights:
        The couch sequence
        Goodbye scene with the parents
        "I no longer fear hell" - Lisa
        Krisis at 
            - the play on TV news coverage
            - Lord of the Flies (including the skewered pig)
        Marge and Homer

    Midlights:
        Mail give-out
        Martin and his imitation gruel
        TV Video voice-over

    Lowlights:
        This is already a tad on the analytical...  If you loved this
        show, great.  That makes one of us. :(

Chris Baird {cjb}:  Rushed.  In the past I've attributed poor storylines to
    the unsuccess of a show, but the voice direction for the first part of
    this episode (including that from the usually splendid Ms. Smith) was
    that abysmal, it should accept the responsibility for most of the jokes
    falling flat. If this happens again, I'm buying a tin of red grease paint.

 Lyrics


 ``South of the Border''

{rlg} (sung over the closing credits.)                 [Postcards on the edge]

    South of the border,[Krusty buys everyone a sombrero that's way too large]
                                     [the kids (sans Lisa) watch a cock fight]
    Down Mexico way.                  [Bart and Lisa find Krusty on the ground
                                        after he's drunk of bottle of Tequila]
    That's where I fell in love [Bart has `Aye Caramba' tattooed in his chest]
                                               [The kids say Adios to Tijuana]
    When stars above came out to play.  [Krusty runs like crazy after the bus]

    And now as I wander,
    My thoughts have restrained,
    South of the border
    Down Mexico way

    She was a picture,
    In old Spanish lace.
    And just for a tender while
    I kissed the smile upon her face.
    For it was Fiesta,
    And we were so gay,
    South of the border
    Down Mexico way

    (band continues without vocals for ~15 seconds)

    Those mission bells told me
    That I must not stray.
    South of the border,
    Down Mexico way!

    Ole!  (instead of the Gracie `Shhhh!')

 Comments and other observations


 References to previous episodes


   [7F08] Bart's Science experiment.  (``June 12th; still just a potatoe..'')
          Mowing the lawn, ``I thought that was the &lt;boy's&gt; job!''

Simpsons Illustrated also consistently mentions the story of the ill-fated
television sit-com ``President Clown''.

The school nurse.

 Butchered in America


Greg Martin {gam}:  Adding to the list of missing animation featuring in the
    radio and TV promotions but never used in the final airing:

    Marge: I miss the kids.
    Homer: You lie.
    Marge: Well, I feel guilty for NOT missing them.

 Miscellaneous


``Leaves of three, let them be.'' is a traditional American camper rhyme to
avoid the Poison Ivy and Poison Oak.  ``Leaves of Four'' is (by popular
opinion) just a typically doofus thing for Homer to say.

Martin Price's Father has dyed his hair (or bleached his face?) since
``Bart the Genius''.

An American being honoured with a Knighthood?  What the hey?

 The quality of the animation


Raymond Flournoy {rsf}:  I really thought I could see a difference in the
    animation.  From the way the characters moved, to some subtle changes
    in their facial expressions, the show had a somehow different look.
    Was this just my imagination?

John R. Donald {jrd}:  I agree [w/ the subtle differences].  It was very
    cartoon-like, which I guess is an odd criticism for a cartoon.

 EPISODE TITLE: A Streetcar Named Marge


EPISODE SUMMARY: 

   

 Television.
   
   Live from beautiful Laughlin, Nevada, it's the Miss American Girl Pageant!
   Brought to you my Meryl Streep's Versatility:  Smell like Streep for Cheep!
   I'm your host, Troy McClure!
   -- Another silly beauty pageant, ``''
   
 Homer and the kids watch at home.  (Lisa keeps score on a notepad.)
 Marge leaves the family microwave dinners while she tries out for a part
 in a local musical production of ``A Streetcar Named Desire''.  No one
 pays any attention.
   
   If you ask me, they're all winners!
   We'll be cutting our first 40 contestants right after this.
   -- Troy McClure hosts the Miss American Girl Pageant,
      ``''
   
 Troy introduces the judges, and everyone watches with rapt attention,
   
   Marge: I thought it would be a good chance to meet some other adults.
   Homer: [eyes fixed on the television set]  Sounds interesting.
   Marge: You know, I spend all day home with Maggie.  Sometimes it's
          like I don't even exist.
   Homer: [eyes fixed on the television set]  Sounds interesting.
   -- Sounds interesting, ``''
   
 Homer adds his commentary to the selection of the five finalists, while
 Marge warms up her voice by the piano.
   
   Tonight, my reign as Miss American Girl comes to an end, and I'd like to
   apologize one last time for my unfortunate remarks at the United Nations.
   -- Debra Jo Smallwood, ``''
   
 Maggie's musical rendition of Tchaikovsky's Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairies
 on the toy xylophone is greeted with a ``Maggie, cut that racket!'' from
 Homer.

 Homer asks Marge where she's going, insisting that this is the first he's
 heard of her plans to audition.  The kids back him up.

 At the Springfield Community Center, the prospective performers in ``Oh!
 Streetcar!'' warm up.  Among the auditioners are Chief Wiggum, Jasper,
 and Ned Flanders, who mentions that he has once already performed in
 ``A Streetcar Named Desire''---as Blanche DuBois.  (That's what happens
 when you go to an all-male school.)

 Enter Llewelyn Sinclair.
   
   I have directed three plays in my career, and I have had three heart attacks.
   That's how much I care, I'm planning a fourth.
   -- Llewelyn Sinclair, ``''
   
   Marge:  Maybe I should've a nice calligraphy class.
   Wiggum: Oh, forget about it.  That Mr. Takahashi's a lunatic!
   -- ``''
   
   I am not an easy man to work for.  While directing ``Hats off to Channukah'',
   I reduced more than one cast member to tears.  Did I expect too much from
   fourth-graders?  The review [holds up a school newspaper] ``Play enjoyed by
   all'' speaks for itself.
   -- Llewelyn Sinclair, ``''
   
 First order of business is for all men auditioning for the part of Stanley
 to remove their shirts.  Mr. Sinclair rejects most of the auditioners
 out of hand, leaving Ned's muscular physique as the winning candidate.

 Mr. Sinclair cuts off all the auditions for the r\^ole of Blanche before
 any of the women can complete their first phrase.  (Marge is interrupted
 in the middle of her first word.)  While he fumes that no one is qualified
 for the part, Marge is on the pay phone, conceding, ``You were right.
 Outside interests are stupid.''  Sinclair overhears the conversation and
 he makes his choice.  He grabs the phone and yells into the receiver,
 ``Stop bothering my Blanche!''

 [End of Act One.  Time: 5:09]

 At the breakfast table, Marge relates the good news.
   
   Wow!  My mother the actress.  I feel like Lucy Arnaz-Luckinbill.
   -- Lisa, ``''
   
   Bart:  Are there any jive-talking robots in this play?
   Marge: Mm, I don't think so.
   Homer: Bart, don't ask stupid questions.
          [to Marge]  Is there any frontal nudity?
   -- How about nude jive-talking robots?  ``''
   
 At the first rehearsal, the players introduce themselves.  Helen Lovejoy
 plays Stella, Apu as Steve, Otto as Pablo...
   
   Lionel Hutz, Attorney at Law.  I'm filing a class-action suit against the
   director on behalf of everyone who was cut from the play.  I also play Mitch!
   -- Rehearsal of fortune, ``''
   
 Marge has a tray of peanut-butter brownies for all.

 Ned and Marge rehearse a scene where Stanley attempts to ravish Blanche.
 During the scene, Maggie grabs Ned's glasses and peers through them.
 The scene is adorable.  Notes Ned, ``Isn't that cute.  Me without a camera.''
 Annoyed by the interruption, Sinclair gives Marge the address of a day-care
 center run by his sister.

 At the Ayn Rand School for Tots, Marge summarizes Maggie's needs, but
 Ms. Sinclair has her own strict views on how babies should be treated.
 (``Our aim here is to develop the bottle within.'')
   
   Mrs. Simpson, I don't like to toot my own horn, but we're the only day-care
   in town that is not currently under investigation by the state.
   -- Ms. Sinclair, administrator of the Ayn Rand School for Tots,
      ``''
   
 Marge leaves Maggie in Ms. Sinclair's care, and the first order of business
 is to confiscate the pacifier.  Maggie watches glumly as her pacifier is
 played inside a locker.

 At rehearsal, Marge can't muster the raw hatred needed for the broken bottle
 scene.  (Indeed, she can't even break the bottle.)  Sinclair gives up in
 despair.

 Homer plays a hand-held Bowling 2000 video game but manages to get a 7-10
 split.  He is hardly willing to help Marge run her lines.

 At the day-care, Maggie looks up longingly at the locker.  She sits down
 and sucks her thumb.  Not satisfied, she tries various other nearby objects,
 including a crayon, a block, and a Bart Simpson doll.

 Nap time.  Maggie crawls beneath the cots, tapping each baby as she goes
 by as an invitation to join her.  On her cue, they stack all the toys
 in the room, which indeed reach to the locker, and although Maggie can
 squeeze her tiny arm through the slats, the pacifier itself won't fit.
 The scaffolding collapses, leaving Maggie suspended in air, the pacifier
 in her mouth her only support.  Eventually, she falls.  Alerted by the
 noise, Ms. Sinclair comes in and finds Maggie out of her cot.  ``We have
 a place for babies like you:  The box!''  As Maggie is carted away, one
 of her fellow co-conspirators tosses her a ball.

 At rehearsal, Marge still can't muster the harted for the bottle scene.
   
   I just don't see why Blanche should shove a broken bottle in Stanley's face.
   Couldn't she just take his abuse with gentle good humor?
   -- Marge Simpson has difficulty getting into character,
      ``''
   
 Homer arrives to pick up Marge, but Marge asks for a little while longer.
 Marge doesn't see what's so bad about Stanley, while Homer in the background
 performs a flying drop-kick of a recalcitrant candy vending machine.  Homer
 goes to the car and honks the horn.  ``Marge!  Move it or lose it!''  Marge's
 eyebrows furrow as she envisions Homer, not Ned, as her tormentor.  The
 hatred is there, and it takes Ned by surprise.  ``Ned, you're supposed to
 overpower her.''  ``I'm trying, I'm trying!''

 [End of Act Two.  Time: 10:46]

 Dinner.
   
   Salt me.
   -- Homer, ``''
   
 Marge passes the salt with a Southern accent, in preparation for the
 premi\`ere the following evening.  Lisa offers to help by speaking in
 a Southern accent of her own, and Bart joins in with a ``Bob's your
 uncle, Mate.''  Marge leaves to rehearse with Ned.
   
   Homer: What about dessert?
   Marge: For God's sakes, you can pull the lid off your own can of pudding!
   Homer: Fine!  I will!
   -- That'll show 'er, ``''
   
 The pull-tab breaks off, leaving Homer's pudding trapped inside forever.
 Homer goes below Ned's window and shouts, ``Maaaaaaaarge!''

 Ned's chest is bandaged from a too-realistic-for-the-stage bottle scene,
 as Marge mutters, ``Keep yelling, you big ape.''  Marge angrily smashes
 a bottle and offers to rehears the bottle scene again.

 In bed, Homer asks when the play starts, not so much out of genuine
 interest, but rather familial duty.
   
   Marge: I'm sure you won't enjoy it.
          There's nothing about bowling in the play.
          Oh wait, there is.
   Homer: Probably not much of it.
   -- Enough to placate the special interests, ``''
   
   Marge: Why can't you be more supportive?
   Homer: Because I don't care.
   -- Ask a question, ``''
   
   Homer: I can't fake an interest in this, and I'm an expert at faking an
          interest in your kooky projects.
   Marge: What kooky projects?
   Homer: You know, the painting class, the first aid course,
          the whole Lamaze thing.
   -- ``''
   
 When Marge asks why he never mentioned this before, Homer explains, ``You
 know I would never do anything to hurt your feelings,'' then promptly
 falls asleep.

 At the Ayn Rand School, Maggie leads another covert operation.  Through a
 series of ingenious and resourceful tricks too brilliant to describe, Maggie
 manages to sneak into Ms. Sinclair's office...
   
   If I break, buy a new one!
   -- The talking Krusty doll, ``''
   
 ... grab the keys to the locker, then swing over to the locker and set
 free all of the pacifiers therein.  This kid has real talent.

 Homer brings Bart and Lisa along to pick up Maggie, but finds a room full
 of babies sucking on pacifiers in an otherwise eerie silence.  He locates
 Maggie and tiptoes out.

 Llewelyn Sinclair gives one last pep talk before the curtain rises.  Chief
 Wiggum introduces the opening number, and the musical proceeds.  The
 rhymes in the lyrics prove challenging.  Homer is bored until Marge's
 entrance, after which his attention remains fixed.  In a later scene,
 Marge floats in anguish around the stage surrounded by red fog and lasers.
   
   Cool, she can fly!
   -- Bart, ``''
   
 Lisa explains that it's supposed to represent her descent into madness.
 Blanche's final line, ``I have always relied on the kindness of strangers,''
 is the cue for the cheery final number, which concludes with ``A stranger's
 just a friend you haven't met.''  The curtain calls are taken, but Marge's
 smile vanishes when she sees Homer's drooped head in the audience.

 Backstage, Lisa propels Bart across the stage in the rope rigging used in
 the madness scene.
   
   Hey, look at me!  I'm Blanche DuBois!
   -- Bart, ``''
   
 At Marge's entrance, Lisa lets go of the rope, and Bart lands with a thud,
 no worse for the wear.  Homer sends the kids ahead into the car while he
 talks with Marge.  Marge is upset that Homer didn't even have the courtesy
 to keep his head upright through the performance, but Homer explains that
 he wasn't bored; he was sad.
   
   Homer: It really got to me how that lady, uh...  You know which one I mean.
          You played her.
   Marge: Blanche!
   Homer: Yeah.
   -- Interactive Cliff's Notes, ``''
   
 He continues, ``The poor thing gets hauled to the nuthouse when all she
 needed was for that big slob to show her some respect.''  At least, that's
 his interpretation of events.

 Outside, Homer notes, ``Hey, I'm a lot like that guy.''  Marge concedes,
 ``Well, maybe just a little,'' and gives him a kiss.

 Reviews


Scott Amspoker@{sa}:  All in all, I thought the episode was average at first.
    However, today the episode is still with me for some strange reason.
    The more I think about it the more I like it. I'll have to watch it again.

J.D. Baldwin@{jdb}:  ``A is A.''  I thought I was gonna die.

John R. Donald@{jrd}:  I agree, references for their own sake add nothing to
    the show, like a meaningless guest appearance (Sting, Magic Johnson).
    However when a guest voice is incorporated into the plot well, and the
    references are not just references but are actually satire, then this
    device works - it wasn't funny because it was a reference to Ayn Rand,
    it was funny because it was an Ayn Rand Day Care Center - it wasn't
    funny because Marge was in 'Streetcar', it was funny because it was a
    musical version.  As far as the plot goes, it was great, back to the
    basics, back to simple family issues, which turn out to be funnier than
    plots that are too contrived.

John J. Wood@{jjw}:  With the exceptions of the Maggie subplot, and Homer
    at the candy machine, last night's episode was boringly mundane.

entertainment!

 Lyrics


With assistance from Ron Carter.

 Blanche/Stanley number


    Stanley: You're a dame and I'm a fella...
    Blanche: Stop it, Stanley or I'll tell Stella...
    Stanley: All I want is one embrace...
    Blanche: I'll twist this bottle &lt;in your face&gt;!

    | The second time through, Marge's line is ``Stanley, stop'' instead
      of ``Stop it, Stanley''.

 The opening number


    . Long before the Superdome,
    . Where the Saints of football play,
    . There's a city where the damned call home,
    . Hear their hellish rondelet:
    .
    . New Orleans!
    . Home of pirates, drunks, and whores...
    . New Orleans!
    . Tacky, overpriced souvenir stores...
    .
    . If you want to go to hell, you should take a trip
    . To the Sodom and Gomorrah of the Mississip':
    .
    . New Orleans!
    . Stinking, rotten, vomiting, vile...
    . New Orleans!
    . Putrid, brackish, maggotty, foul...
    .
    . New Orleans!
    . Crummy, lousy, rancid and rank...
    . New Orleans!
    . ...

 Blanche's introduction


   . I thought my life, would be a Mardi Gras...
   . A never-ending party... (pause) Ha!
   .
   . I'm a faded Southern dame without a dime...

 Steve (Apu) and Blanche


    Steve: [spoken] I'm collecting for the Evening Star.
    Blanche: [sexily] Come here...  I want to kiss you, just once.
       		Softly, and sweetly... on your &lt;mouth&gt;...
    Steve: [sings]
	   I am just a simple paperboy, no romance do I seek.
	   I just wanted forty cents, for my deliveries last week.
	   Will this bewitching floozy
	   Seduce this humble newsie?
	   Oh, what's a paperboy to... doooooo?
    Blanche: [kisses Steve]
    Steve: Woo-hoo!

 Stanley's torment


   Stella!  STELLLAAAA!  Can't you hear me YELLA!
   You're puttin' me through HELLA!  Stella...  STELLLAAAA!

 The closing number


    Blanche: Whoever you are,
	     I have always depended on the kindness of strangers...
    [begin song]
    Chorus:
	   You can always depend on the kindness of strangers
	   To pluck up your spirits, and shield you from dangers.
    Blanche:
	   Now here's a tip from Blanche you won't regret.
    Chorus:
	   A stranger's just a friend you haven't met.
	   You ha-ven't met...
	   Streetcar!

 Animation and continuity goofs


All observed by Dave Hall @{dh}.

    - The VCR on top of the TV wasn't shown in the close-ups.
    - During the pageant, Maggie only appears for that one scene with the
      toy xylophone.
    - Marge was carrying a purse when she walked across the den, but not in
      later scenes.
    - As seen from the front of the stage, Ned is standing beside Otto;
      but from behind, there's nobody near Otto.
    - It was nighttime when Homer went to pick up Maggie, but inside the
      daycare the windows depicted a day view.  [I disagree. --rjc]
    - The salt-shaker vanished from the dinner table.
    - The ventilation duct crossed the path of the window.  (So much for
      Frank Lloyd-Wright...)

Blackwell comes out with an annual worst-dressed list.  As if it's
bad enough to appear on the list, each unfortunate victim also earns
a brief insult from Blackwell.  Like anybody cares any more.

 Ayn Rand


J. D. Baldwin@{jdb} explains, for those illiterates among us:
Ayn Rand was a ``philosopher'' who claimed that a complex
system of epistemology, aesthetics, ethics, metaphysics and politics
could be derived from the simple, ``self-evident'' proposition that ``A = A''.
Her philosophical system is widely regarded as ``right-wing'', whatever
that means.

Adam Trotter@{ast} adds that the school's architecture is in the
style of Frank Lloyd Wright, who was the model for Howard Roark, the
protagonist of ``The Fountainhead''.

 Assorted


One of the signal toys during Maggie's escapades was a pop-up book
starring a certain rabbit.

Bart complains of ``A pain in me Gulliver'', cf. A Clockwork Orange.

Some claim references to the Peanuts comic strip: A kid with a blue
security blanket and a toy piano can be seen.  (I challenge you to
find any day-care that &lt;doesn't&gt; have a toy piano.)

 Fallout


The day after the episode's first airing, the producers were compelled to
issue a formal apology to the city of New Orleans.  Apparently, some cities
can't take a joke...

 Boring distribution restrictions

 EPISODE TITLE: Homer the Heretic


EPISODE SUMMARY: 

   

 Prenatal Homer.  ``Ah, what a beautiful day in the womb.''  Until the fluid
 drains and a hand reaches in to remove him.  Homer clings for dear life...

 ... to the bedpost, as Marge tries to drag him out of bed for church.
 Homer maintains that it is too cold out.  Outside, a polar baird scavenges
 the Simpsons trash can.  Homer struggles with his itchy church pants...
   
   One size fits all my butt!
   -- Homer, ``''
   
 They rip.  ``Forget it.  I'm not going.''  Marge scowls...

 ... as she drives the kids to church.  In the car, Maggie removes her
 pacifier and licks the kiddie seat, only to have her tongue stick to it.
   
   Bart:  Hey, where's Homer?
   Marge: Your father's ... resting.
   Bart:  Resting hung over?  Resting got fired?  Help me out, here.
   -- The Norwegian Blue prefers kipping on its back, ``''
   
 Homer remains snuggled in bed, but reluctantly rouses himself to go to
 the bathroom.
   
   I'm wizzing with the door open, and I love it!
   -- Homer Alone, ``''
   
 Homer takes a nice warm shower.
   
   Radio: I hope you're somplace warm.
   Homer: You bet your sweet... [looks around to make sure nobody's around]
          &lt;ASS!&gt;
   -- Can I say that on this network?  ``''
   
 The congregation shiver in the unheated church, thanks to a broken furnace,
 as Reverend Lovejoy reads from the long version of the Lamentations of
 Jeremiah.  Maggie unscrews the cap from her bottle, to find that the
 milk itself has frozen.

 At home, Homer sends the thermostat up to 100 degrees (Fahrenheit),
 cranks the stereo to full power, and dances around the house wearing
 only his underwear and sunglasses, singing ``Short Shorts.''  He then
 raids the fridge to make one of his patented out-of-this-world space-age
 Moon Waffles, a truly sickening concoction.
   
   Oooooh...  Waffle runoff...
   -- Homer helps himself to leftover waffle batter, ``''
   
   Mmmm... Fattening...
   -- Homer enjoys a patented out-of-this-world space-age Moon Waffle,
      ``''
   
 Reverend Lovejoy's description of the fire and brimstone of Hell warms
 up his audience.  Muses Bart, ``Aaaaahhhhhh... I'm there.''

 Homer drops some of his Moon Waffle on his chest, so he has Santa's Little
 Helper lick it off.

 The service has ended, but nobody can get out because the door has frozen
 shut.  Lisa quietly recites an Our Father.
   
   Lisa, this is neither the time nor the place.
   -- Bart tells Lisa to stop praying in church, ``''
   
 Listening to the radio, Homer discovers that he can answer the trivia
 question posed by the dee-jays.  He calls in and wins.

 Groundskeeper Willy turns an acetylene torch to the door in an attempt
 to unstick it.  To pass the time, Reverend Lovejoy reads the church
 bulletin.
   
   Card table for sale, top badly damaged, leg missing, otherwise fine.
   One dollar or best offer.
   -- Advertisement in the church bulletin, ``''
   
 Homer watches a Three Stooges movie.
   
   Moe is their leader.
   -- Homer's analysis of The Three Stooges, ``''
   
 With a great ``Huzzah!'', Groundskeeper Willy opens the door.  The
 congregation nearly stampede out of church.

 Homer turns on the television, only to be disappointed that it's a
 discussion show.
   
   We interrupt this public affairs program in order to bring you a football game.
   -- ``''
   
 Homer celebrates victory.

 Meanwhile, Marge's car is the only one left in the church parking lot.  It
 won't start.  Lisa offers backseat advice, then reconsiders.

 Homer polishes off a bag of chips as he watches the football game.
   
   Oh, Doctor!  A 98-yard triple-reverse ties the score at 63--63!
   We have seen nothing but razzle-dazzle here today, three visits from
   Morganna the Kissing Bandit, and the surprising return of Jim Brown!
   -- Keith Jackson calls the football game, ``''
   
 And as if Homer's day weren't perfect enough, he finds a penny on the floor.
   
   Could this be the best day of my life?
   [thought balloon:  Homer weds Marge]
   [thought balloon:  Homer dances as an overturned beer truck sprays its contents
                      like a fountain]
   Looks like we have a new champion!
   -- Homer, ``''
   
 The rest of the family finally arrive, cold and weary.
   
   I, on the other hand, have been having a wonderful day,
   and I owe it all to skipping church!
   -- Homer, ``''
   
 Homer vows that he will never go to church again.
   
   Marge: Are you actually giving up your faith?
   Homer: [backpedaling] No!  No-no-no-no-no no! [pause] Well, yes.
   -- ``''
   
 [End of Act One.  Time: 6:42]

 As Marge struggles to scrape the goo off the waffle iron, Homer explains
 his position.  Bart supports Homer in evangelical fashion.
   
   And what if we picked the wrong religion?  Every week, we're just making
   God madder and madder!
   -- Homer, ``''
   
 Marge prays for Homer, while he plays with her hair.  Marge edges away to
 a less occupied portion of the bed and prays in a whisper.  Homer salaciously
 awaits.  ``I can wait all...''  He falls asleep and dreams...

 Homer sits on the couch as the entire house is shaken as if by an earthquake.
 (The TV set says, ``Uh-oh!'')  A shaft of light pierces through the dark
 clouds overhead, the Hand of God removes the roof of the house, and His
 Almighty stands in the Simpsons television room.
   
   God:   Thou hast forsaken My Church!
   Homer: [in fear]  Uh, kind-of...  b-but...
   God:   But what!
   Homer: I'm not a bad guy!  I work hard, and I love my kids.  So why should
          I spend half my Sunday hearing about how I'm going to Hell?
   God:  [pause]  Hmm...  You've got a point there.
   -- ``''
   
   You know, sometimes even &lt;I'd&gt; rather be watching football...
   -- God chats with Homer about missing church on Sunday, ``''
   
   God:   Does Saint Louis still have a team?
   Homer: Naw, they moved to Phoenix.
   God:   Oh.  Right.
   -- God and Homer talk about the important things in life, ``''
   
 Homer explains that what bugs him most about church is the sermons.  God
 couldn't agree more.
   
   That Reverend Lovejoy &lt;really&gt; displeases Me.
   I think I'll give him a canker sore.
   -- God, ``''
   
 Homer explains that he'll just worship God in his own way.  God agrees.
 ``It's a deal.''
   
   Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to appear in a tortilla in Mexico.
   -- God takes his leave, ``''
   
 Homer waves good-bye in his sleep.

 Homer ambles through the backyard dressed in monks' robes.
   
   Lisa:  Why are you dedicating your life to blasphemy?
   Homer: Don't worry, sweetheart.  If I'm wrong, I'll recant on my deathbed.
   -- Always have a backup plan, ``''
   
 Two birds and a squirrel alight on St. Homer of Assisi.  They remain with
 him while he takes a shower.  ``Guys, please, will you give me five
 minutes?''

 Reverend Lovejoy joins the Simpsons for dinner.
   
   Marge:  Reverend Lovejoy, I had a bit of an ulterior motive in
           inviting you to dinner.
   Rev. Lovejoy: [surprised and angry] What!?
   -- ``''
   
 Homer explains...
   
   Homer:        God Himself told me I should seek a new path.
   Rev. Lovejoy: [suspicious] Oh, really...
   Homer:        Yeah.  He appeared before me in a dream, and I knew that
                 was special because I usually dream about naked...
                 [off Marge's glare] Marge.
   -- ``''
   
   Perfect teeth.  Nice smell.  A class act, all the way.
   -- Homer describes God, ``''
   
   Rev. Lovejoy: Homer, I'd like you to remember Matthew 7:26.
                 ``A foolish man who who built his house on sand.''
   Homer:        And &lt;you&gt; remember... Matthew ... 21:17!
   Rev. Lovejoy: ``And he left them and went out of the city into
                 Bethany and he lodged there''?
   Homer:        Yeah...  [regains his nerve]  Think about it!
   -- Dueling scriptures with an unloaded gun, ``''
   
 At Moe's Tavern, Homer calls in to work to tell them he won't be in tomorrow
 due to a religious holiday.  When asked for the name of the holiday, Homer
 looks around the barroom and comes up with ``The Feast of Maximum
 Occupancy.''  Homer invites Moe to join his religion, but Moe explains,
 ``I was born a Snake Handler, and I'll die a Snake Handler.''

 Homer answers the door to find Ned, armed with a guitar, and backed up
 by his loving family.  Their mission is to win Homer back to the flock.
 They begin singing, but Homer slams the door in their faces.

 At work, Homer answers the phone, and hears more singing.

 The Flanderses pull up beside Homer on the street and continue their singing.
 Homer pulls away.
   
   Dad, the heathen's getting away!
   -- Todd Flanders, ``''
   
 A car chase ensues.  Homer crosses the train tracks just meters ahead of
 the train.  Undaunted, Ned drives his wagon through an open boxcar.
 The chase continues to Springfield Harbor, where Homer drives the car off
 the dock and lands on an outgoing barge.  Ned stops his car just in time.
 Home celebrates victory, until he learns he's landed on a garbage barge.

 ``Flay Me to the Moon'', another insane Itchy and Scratchy cartoon.
 Marge tells the kids it's time for church, and Bart asks why Homer can stay
 home.  Marge reluctantly explains that Homer is ``wicked''.
   
   Kids, let me tell you about another so-called [makes quotation marks with
   fingers] ``wicked'' guy.  He had long hair and some wild ideas.  He didn't
   always do what other people thought was right.  And that man's name was...
   I forget.  But the point is...  I forget that, too.  Marge, you know what
   I'm talking about.  He used to drive that blue car?
   -- Homer's parable of the guy in the blue car, ``''
   
   Marge: Homer, please don't make me choose between my man and my God, because
          you just can't win.
   Homer: There you go again, always taking someone else's side.
          Flanders, the water department, God...
   -- They're all against me, ``''
   
 Homer turns down one last opportunity to go to church.  At church, Reverend
 Lovejoy's sermon begins with a pronouncement that the devil lives among them.
 Bart attacks a man with a goatee before Reverend Lovejoy can explain what
 he meant.

 Homer lounges in his underwear reading a Lorne Michaels interview in
 ``Playdude'' magazine.
   
   ``Our unabashed dictionary defines IUD as `love springs internal'.''
   Heh-heh-heh-heh-heh! ... I don't get it.
   -- Homer reads ``Playdude'' magazine, ``''
   
 Krusty comes to the door collecting for the Brotherhood of Jewish Clowns.
   
   Homer:  Wait a minute, is this a religious thing?
   Krusty: A religious &lt;clown&gt; think, yes.
   -- Krusty collects for the Brotherhood of Jewish Clowns, ``''
   
 Homer slams the door in his face.

 Reverend Lovejoy recites the commandment ``Keep holy the Sabbath day'',
 as Homer buys a crate of Duff and a box of cigars from the Kwik-E-Mart.
 Homer notes that Apu isn't in church, but Apu corrects him:  He has a
 shrine to Ganeesha in the employee lounge.  Homer walks over to the
 multi-armed elephant, ``Hey, Ganeesha.  Wanna peanut?''
   
   Please do not offer my god a peanut.
   -- Apu, ``''
   
 Homer makes some disparaging remarks regarding Apu's choice of religion.
   
   [angrily] Mr. Simpson, please pay for your purchases and get out and
   [brightly] come again!
   -- Apu, ``''
   
 ``Pride goeth before Destruction,'' proclaims Reverend Lovejoy.

 Homer lounges on the couch smoking a cigar.
   
   Boy, everyone is stupid except me.
   -- Homer Simpson, ``''
   
 He falls asleep and the cigar falls out of his mouth onto
 the copy of ``Playdude'', lighting it.  The fire quickly spreads throughout
 the house, aided by the oily rags and blasting caps stored in the basement.
 The house is now engulfed in flame.  ``Marge, turn down the heat. ...  That's
 better.''

 [End of Act Two.  Time: 15:49]

 Santa's Little Helper rushes into the burning living room and tugs at Homer's
 robe.  He finds a Hershey's bar, takes it, and escapes.  The fire singes
 Homer's two hairs, which wakes him up.
   
   Aaaaaugh!  [finds himself in the middle of a fire]  What do I do?  What do
   I do?  [cough cough]  Oh, the song.  The song.
   [sings] When the fire starts to burn,
           There's a lesson you must learn.
           Something something, then you'll see:
           You'll avoid catastrophe!
   [realizes]  D'oh!
   -- Homer's lesson for the day, ``''
   
 Homer collapses from the smoke.

 Through his binoculars, Apu spots the fire.  He puts on his shiny Fire Chief
 hat and leaves little Jamshed to watch the store.  The young boy cocks out
 a shotgun.  ``I have waited for this day.''  Jimbo, Kerny, and Dolph freeze
 in their tracks.

 The volunteer fire truck races towards the Simpsons house.  But first, it
 must wait at a duck crossing.  Ned discovers the burning house and rushes in
 to carry Homer out.  But his exit is blocked by a fallen burning beam.  So
 he carries Homer to Maggie's room, tosses out a mattress, then shoves Homer
 out the window after a prayer.  Homer lands on the mattress and bounces
 back into the house via the front bay window.  With a sigh, Ned does the
 same.  He finally drags Homer out the now-broken front window as the
 fire truck arrives.
   
   Homer: Flanders, you saved me!  Why?
   Ned:   Heck!  You'd'a done the same for me.
   Homer: [thought balloon:  Ned screams for help, trapped in his house.  Homer
          lounges in his hammock chuckling.]  That's right, old friend.
   -- ``''
   
 Marge and the kids rush to Homer's side, concerned.
   
   Our magazines and roach traps...  Gone!  All gone!
   -- Homer remains in a state of shock after the house fire,
      ``''
   
 Krusty saves the cat.  Barney uses the axe to chop the Simpsons mailbox.
 Lisa notes, ``Truly this was an Act of God.''  The fire spreads to Ned's
 house, and Homer notes, ``Hey.  Flanders is a regluar Charlie Church, and
 God didn't save &lt;his&gt; house.''  A tiny cloud forms over the Flanders
 house, the rain dousing the fire, and the damage sealed with a rainbow.

 The insurance representative arrives.
   
   Insurance agent: Any valuables in the house?
   Homer:           Well, the Picasso, my collection of classic cars...
   Insurance agent: Sorry, this policy only covers actualy losses,
                    not made-up stuff.
   Homer:           [miffed] Well that's just great!

 A Channel 6 mobile truck has arrived.

   Brockman: [brightly] Coming up next:  Which work better?  Spring clothespins
             or the other kind?

 In the kitchen, the firefighters enjoy a well-deserved mug of hot cocoa.
 Homer learns his lesson:
   
   The Lord is veangeful.  [falls to his knees]  Oh Spiteful One,
   Show me who to smite, and he shall be smoten!
   -- Homer, ``''
   
   Ned:          Homer, God didn't set your house on fire.
   Rev. Lovejoy: No, but He &lt;was&gt; working in the hearts of your friends and
                 neighbors when they came to your aid,
   be they [points to Ned] Christian, [Krusty] Jew, or [Apu] ... miscellaneous.

   Homer: I was rude to every one of you, and you saved my life when you could've

   Marge: Aw, Homer, I'm so glad to hear you say that.

 Homer promises to be in church next Sunday, front row center.

 And he holds his promise, snoring loudly in the front pew.  Homer enters
 Dream-Land.
   
   Don't worry, Homer.  Nine out of ten religions fail in their first year.

 In the background Ben Franklin (Yes, Ben Franklin) beats Jimi Hendrix

   Homer: I can't wait that long!
   God:   You can't wait six months?

 Homer wants to know now, so God decides to tell him.  ``The meaning of life

 Animation and continuity goofs


Two angles in the post-Itchy and Scratch scene seem poorly-done.
Marge's first close-up shows a darker coat, and her bustline is different.
After Marge says, ``I'll have to tell them their father is...'', the
quick shot of Lisa shows a darker dress.  Incidentally, throughout the scene,
the way Lisa is sitting on the couch really shows off her paunch.

The soot on Ned's forehead magically disappears.

 Comments and other observations


 References from the obvious to the obscure


 No Soap, Radio!


The shower radio was named ``No Soap, Radio!''  If you don't get the joke,
you probably can't.

 Keith Jackson


Although the football announcer was apparently intended to be Keith
Jackson, Keith Jackson calls college football games, which take place
on Saturdays. @{mdv}

 Morganna the Kissing Bandit


During the mid 80's, an overly-endowed woman would often rush onto the
playing field of a major American sports event and plant a smooch on a
player.  She would then quickly be escorted off the stadium grounds by
security.

 Short Shorts


[syracurg@lp.musc.edu] gives a brief musical history lesson:

``Short Shorts dates back to 1958, when it was recorded as a legit
song by the Blazers and also the Royal Teens (and a few other groups).

 Marge the mother


Bart's Sunday attire consisted of a brown blazer, brown shorts, and brown
shoes.  (But still with the little white dot on the inside of the foot.
Were they brown sneakers?)  Lisa was wearing her traditional pink Sunday
dress, with short sleeves and a short skirt.  How could Marge have let
her kids go to church in sub-freezing weather dressed in summer clothes?
They weren't even wearing coats!

 Homer's coffee mug


Could anyone make out the picture on Homer's coffee mug as he listens
to the radio?  It looks like a pirate but I can't figure out why.
(I.e., it wasn't funny.)

 Ben Franklin?


Yes, it was Ben Franklin.  For evidence, I point you at episode [7F03],
in which Ben Franklin invents the sled.  You'll see that the two characters
have the same appearance and the same voice.

 Church


Notice that Springfield Presbyterian Church has a somewhat relaxed dress
code.  Hats, make-up, and shorts are permitted.  And one wonders whether
the damage to the card table advertised in the bulletin was Satan-induced.

 Homer's story


In case you didn't attend Sunday School for one reason or another, the
traditional antecedent of Homer's story about the ``guy with long hair
and wild ideas'' is Jesus.  As usual, Homer threatens to show a
glimmer of intelligence, but we discover that he was on a completely
different track.

 Jamshed


Amitava Biswas @{ab} suggests that Jamshed is named after Jamshed
Tata, one of India's most famous industrialists, akin to Ford in the US.

 Miscellaneous


Now that most of the walls and floors of the house have been burnt, the
Simpsons might discover the gold and jewels hidden under the floor of
Lisa's room. ... Naaaaah.

 EPISODE TITLE: Lisa the Beauty Queen


EPISODE SUMMARY: 

   

 Welcome to the Springfield Elementary School Carnival, ``The Happiest
 Place on Earth''.  The town lawyer (joined by two thugs) threatens a
 lawsuit over the use of the Disneyland copyright phrase.  Skinner
 fights back.  Literally.

 At a water pistol booth, Nelson turns his weapon on Martin.
 Elsewhere, Bart runs a booth of his own---Three-card Monte.  When
 Skinner approaches, Bart disappears in a puff of smoke.  Meanwhile,
 Groundskeeper Willie mans a customer-less ``Haggis -- 50 cents'' booth.
   
   Get your Haggis right here!  Chopped heart and lungs boiled in a wee
   sheep's stomach!  Tastes as good as it sounds.
   -- Groundskeeper Willie, ``''
   
 Homer challenges the ``Guess Your Age and Weight'' booth.  The
 operator guesses ``53 years old and 420 pounds''.  ``Ha ha, you
 lose!, 36 and 239!''

 Operating `The Paralyzer', Otto accepts Bart's challenge to make the
 ride go faster.  A capsule breaks off and crashes into the side of
 the school, bursting into flames.
   
   I'll be in Mexico until this thing blows over.
   -- Otto, ``''
   
 Cub scout Milhouse is excited at finding Jimbo's Spookhouse.
 Inside, Milhouse finds himself surrounded by Jimbo, Dolph and
 Kearny.  Jimbo threatens Milhouse as Kearny demands he hand over all
 his cash.  Outside, Milhouse clutches his stomach as Bart strolls by
 with an ice-cream cone.  When Milhouse confirms that the experience
 was indeed scary, Bart eagerly enters.  ``Uh-oh.''

 Lisa sits down to have a caricature done of her.
   
   Artist: [making small talk] So girly, you like roller skate'n?
   Lisa:   No.
   Artist: Yeahhhhh, everybody loves roller skate'n!
   -- ``''
   
 Lisa gasps at the crude drawing of herself on roller-skates, chasing
 a boy.  The surrounding crowd laugh.  Lisa regards the drawing the
 artist hands to her, ``Oh my God!  I'm ugly!''

 On the school steps, Principal Skinner prepares to raffle off the
 grand prize:  A ride in the Duff Blimp.  Homer slips into a fantasy...
   
   You see the circular patterns on those fields?
   That's from central pivot irrigation.
   -- The blimp pilot gives Homer an aerial tour, ``''
   
 The next stop is the Super Bowl, where a section of the crowd
 creates a giant-sized picture of Homer while chanting his name.
 Back in reality, Homer softly chants his name.

 The second-prize of a shoe-buffer goes to Ned Flanders.
   
   Homer: Oh it's no fair!  We'll never have a buffer!
   Marge: We have one at home, you never use it.
   Homer: [whines] Well, I want that one!
   -- The buffer is always greener, ``''
   
 ``And the winner of the blimp ride is Homer Simpson!''  Homer reacts
 with an ``Oh, my God!''

 In her bedroom, Lisa grieves over the cartoon drawing.  She sobs and
 belly-flops onto her bed, burying her face in a pillow.  In the
 hallway, Homer gaily sings his heart out.
   
   Homer: Heyyy thereeee, blimpy boy!  Flying through the sky so fancy free!
   -- ``''
   
 Homer notices that something is amiss, and Lisa shows him the
 caricature.
   
   Oh, Lisa, this isn't real.
   It's just how you might look if you were a cartoon character.
   -- Homer reassures Lisa, ``''
   
   Homer:  You're cute as a bug's ear.
   Lisa:   Fathers have to say that stuff!
   Homer:  [sees Grampa walk pass] Dad, am I cute as a bug's ear?
   Grampa: [poking head in] No, you're homely as a mule's butt!
   Homer:  [to Lisa] There, see?
   -- ``''
   
 Homer mopes at Mo[p]e's Tavern.
   
   Homer:  Moe, have you ever felt unattractive?
   Moe:    [ponders] Mmmm, no.
   Homer:  [turns to Barney] How about you, Barney?
   Barney: [raising mug] Not for a second!  (*belch*)
   -- ``''
   
 Once again, Homer is saved by the magic of television advertising.
 A man tosses his daughter high into the air, noting that every
 father must think his daughter is the cutest.  He is joined by Jack
 Larson.
   
   Father: Wow, president of Laramie Cigarettes, Jack Larson!
   Larson: This year, Laramie is sponsoring the Little Miss Springfield Pageant.
           You see, government regulations prohibit us from advertising on TV.
           [takes a puff on a cigarette and holds up the box] Ah, that sweet
           Carolina smoke!  But, they can't prohibit us from holding a beauty
           pageant for little girls aged 7 to 9.
   Homer:  Lisa's aged 7 to 9!
   -- ``''
   
   Larson: Your daughter could be crowned Little Miss Springfield by our host,
           the Ma\^itre d' of Glee, Krusty the Clown.
   Krusty: [file footage, blandly] I heartily endorse this event or product.
   -- ``''
   
   Girl:  [dressed as pageant winner] What a feeling!
          I'm as happy as a smoker taking that first puff in the morning!
   Homer: [astonished] That could be Lisa!
   -- ``''
   
 Unfortunately, entry into the pageant costs 250 dollars, and all
 Homer has in his wallet is a photo of Lisa and a blimp ticket.
 Curiously, Barney accepts Homer's offer to sell the ticket for 250
 dollars, and he pays in cash.  Barney explains that he got the money
 ``from sone scientist!  Since they stopped testing on animals, a guy
 like me can really clean up.''  Barney returns to his beer,
 revealing wires connected to the back of his skull.

 [End of Act One.]

 Lisa views her grotesque reflection in a spoon.  Marge tries to
 cheer her up. by singing a song about the ugly duckling.
   
   Marge: Lisa, I know a song that will cheer you up.
          [singing]  ``There once was an ugly duckling...''
   Lisa:  [frowning] So you think I'm ugly?!
   Marge: Noooo.  No, I meant you were one of the good-looking ducks... that
          makes fun of the ugly one.  Mmmm.
   -- ``''
   
 Homer enters and asks Lisa what shd would do with one wish.  Lisa
 would prefer never to be seen by human eyes again.  But Homer grants
 her instead entry into the pageant.  ``I couldn't find a big enough
 photo of you, so I sent in that funny drawing of you on
 roller-skates.''  Lisa refuses to go along and leaves.  Bart
 expresses his hubba-hubba appreciation of the girls who enter beauty
 contests.
   
   Homer: Hey, nobody's prettier than my little girl!
   Marge: Mmmmm, you're looking at her through a father's eyes.
   Homer: Well if I could gouge out somebody else's eyes and shove them into my
          my sockets I would; but to me, she's beautiful!!!
   Marge: [moved] That is so sweet!
   -- ``''
   
 Marge visits Lisa in her room and, although she isn't going to force
 Lisa into doing anything, offers to tell her where Homer got the
 money to enter her into the contest.  Downstairs in the kitchen,
 Homer waves a pickle in the air, singing Blimpy Boy mournfully to
 himself.  Lisa announces, ``I'll do it!''

 Lisa waits in line to register at the pageant.
   
   Girl 1: Didja see Tina Epstein?
   Girl 2: Whoa.  If you're gonna binge, you better purge.
   -- Gossip at the Little Miss Springfield Pageant, ``''
   
 A bleached-blonde little girl enters with a fur coat and blue
 shades.  She discards her coat to reveal a Shirley Temple-esque
 dress.  One hand at her hip, she fluffs her hair with the other.
   
   Girl 2: Amber Dempsey.
   Girl 1: In the same week she was Pork Princess &lt;and&gt; Little Miss Kosher.
   -- ``''
   
 But that's not all.  Amber removes her sunglasses, revealing long
 eyelashes which she blinks adorably whie shrugging her shoulders.
   
   Girl 1: Eyelash implants.
   Lisa:   [puzzled] I thought those were illegal?
   Girl 1: Not in Paraguay.
   -- ``''
   
 At home, Lisa compares Amber to Jack Nicklaus, but Marge thinks
 Jack is much more attractive.  (She fantasizes on the golfer bending
 over to retrieve a sunk putt.)  Lisa clarifies, ``I meant that they
 both win all the time, Mom!''  Marge hurriedly explains that that's
 what she meant, too.  Marge offers to take Lisa to the beauty parlor.
   
   Later, I'll teach you the tricks of the trade:  Taping your
   swimsuit to your butt, petroleum jelly on your teeth for that
   frictionless smile, and the ancient art of padding. [purrs]
   -- Bart, ``''
   
 At the beauty parlor (``Turn Your Head and Coif''), Lisa hangs
 upside down with a mud pack on her face, cucumber slices over the
 eyes, hair in curlers.  She asks the man besides Marge if they're
 finished yet.  Igniting a blowtorch, the man states they're just
 warming up.
   
   Lisa: [feeling the heat from the blowtorch] Uh, isn't this dangerous?
   Man:  Don't worry, I am well protected.
   -- You don't want to get this sucker near your eye or your groin,
      ``''
   
 Lisa's final hair style almost matches her old one.

 As the girls return home, Homer advises Bart to make a big fuss over how
 Lisa looks.  Bart doesn't see the point.
   
   She'll see through me like Grandma's underpants!
   -- Bart, ``''
   
   Homer: When it comes to compliments, [making fierce gestures]
          women are ravenous blood-sucking monsters always want'n more...
          &lt;more&gt;... &lt;MORE&gt;!  And if you give it to them, you'll get
          plenty back in return.
   Bart:  Like what?
   Homer: I'll tell you when you're older.
          [Homer dreams of lounging in a hammock while Marge mows the lawn]
   -- ``''
   
 Homer raises a hand to his face in fake astonishment when Lisa and Marge
 enter the house.
   
   Homer: Is that Lisa?  Oooo, I gotta call heaven.  [looking around]
          There's an angel missing!
   Bart:  [pointing] And whose your little school friend?  [sways back]
          Wait a minute... [puts his hands to his face in shock]  That's Mom!
   -- Flattery will get you most places, ``''
   
 Hook, line and sink-her.  ``I know two fellas who will get a special
 dinner tonight!''  After the girls leave, father and son do a
 high-five.  Bart asks Homer if he knows anything else about women.
 Homer shakes his head, ``No, that's it.''

 Bart applies his newly-acquired knowledge at an ice-cream parlor,
 and it works better than one could imagine.

 Watching the girls rehearse for the beauty pageant, the
 choreographer takes a drag on his cigarette before shouting at them.
   
   I said `Step pause turn pause pivot step step' not `Step pause turn pause
   pivot step pause'!
   -- ``''
   
 With the aid of Maggie (as another contestant) and a
 banana-microphone, Bart-MC pronounces Lisa the winner of the pageant.
   
   Bart: And the winner is... [pause] Lisa Simpson!
   Lisa: [clasps face, gasps]
   Bart: Okay, wipe away a tear... [Lisa complies]
         Hug the loser... [Lisa hugs Maggie]
         And now, for your triumphant walk down the runway.
   -- Dress rehearsal, ``''
   
 But Lisa has trouble with the high heels, ending up with a faceful
 of carpet.  Bart shows her how it's done and really gets into the act.
   
   Lisa: Those other girls are prettier than me.
   Bart: [difficultly] Lis, as your bother, this is the hardest thing I've ever
         had to say... [pause]  You're not ugly.
   Lisa: [joyfully] Oh Bart!
   -- ``''
   
 The Ye Olde Off-Ramp Inn (``We're now Rat-Free!'') plays host to the Little
 Miss Springfield Pageant.  Inside, the pageant opens with the girls on
 stage, doing a musical number.
   
   Amber: [waving] My name is Amber Dempsey.  When I grow up I wanna be a
          sweetie pie.  [flutters eyelashes adorably]
   -- ``''
   
 A Pakistani girl introduces herself.
   
   Pahus: I am Pahusacheta Nahasapeemapetilon, and tonight, I'll be playing
          MacArthur Park on the tablah. [audience laughs] No, I am serious!
   -- ``''
   
 With Apu and Sanjay both attending the pageant, the Kwik-E-Mart is
 left unattended.  Jimbo, Dolph and Kearny haul off the Squishy
 machine.
   
   Lisa:  [introducing herself] My name is Lisa Simpson, and I want to be Li'l
          Miss Springfield so I can make our town a better place.
   Homer: Yeah, clean up this stink-hole!
   -- ``''
   
 Back stage, Jack Larson is markably annoyed at Krusty's late
 arrival.  Helped by Miss Pennycandy, Krusty strains to fit into a
 tuxedo.  ``Yeah, yeah.  What is this, the uh Republican
 fund-raiser?''  On stage, the girls complete the song, and Krusty
 rushes on-stage (not entirely dressed) just in time for his line.

 In the talent segment, Apu and Sanjay, the only people not sleeping,
 applaud loudly when Pahusacheta finally finishes MacArthur Park.
 Lisa is up next.  Before heading on-stage, she applies petroleum
 jelly to her teeth.  Homer tries it and finds it tasty.

 Lisa begins with a rendition of ``America the Beautiful'', then
 strips off her dress, revealing dancing tights, and unleashes a
 rip-roarin' song-and-dance rendition of ``Rollin' on the River''.
 The final round begins.
   
   This is my favorite part of the pageant because---[squints]  Whazzat
   say? ... Oh---it gives me a change to visit with a girl's personality.
   Uh, personally.
   -- Krusty the Clown hosts the Little Miss Springfield Pageant,
      ``''
   
   Krusty: Amber, do you think the Bill of Rights is a good thing, or a
    	baaaaad thing?
   Amber:  Um.... [thinking `hard']
   Krusty: Take your time, dear.
   Amber:  Good thing.  [flutters her eyelashes]
   Judges: Awwwwww...
   -- It's all in the delivery, ``''
   
 Finally...
   
   And now it's time to name our runner up, who if the winner doesn't
   fulfill her duties, blah blah wasa wasa wasa... And don't say it'll never
   happen, because we all remember that thing with what's-her-name,
   [making camera gestures] click click, you know. [wobbles his hand]
   -- Nudge nudge wink wink, ``''
   
 Time to announce the runner-up.  Drum roll.  Lisa and Marge wait
 anxiously; Homer polishes off the rest of the petroleum jelly.
 The runner-up is Lisa, leaving Amber Dempsey as the winner.  As
 Amber triumphantly walks down the runway, Krusty sings to the winner.
   
   L the losers in her wake,
   I the income she will make,
   T is for her tooth-filled mouth,
   T is for her tooth-filled mouth...
   -- Krusty sings the L-I-T-T-L-E M-I-S-S S-P-R-I-N-G-F-I-E-L-D song,
      ``''
   
 At home, Lisa sadly watches Scott Christian's news report with her family.
   
   Coming up next, a new fad that's sweeping the nation -- wasting food.
   -- Scott Christian's news report, ``''
   
 But first, Amber Dempsey opens the Danish super-chain ``Sh{\o}p''.
   
   Scott, everyone is here... From the mayor's illegitimate son to our
   own Duff Blimp.
   -- Kent Brockman's report, ``''
   
 The blimp pilot lets Barney drive for a while.  Barney proceeds to
 steer the blimp into a radio tower, and the dirigible bursts into
 flames.  Meanwhile, Mayor Quimby and Jack Larson applaud as Amber
 turns on the ``Severe tire damage'' spikes.  Menacing thunderclouds
 roll in, and it begins to rain.
   
   Marge: Oh dear, it'll be a shame if that pretty dress got wet.
   Lisa:  I'd say the greater danger is her sceptre acting as a lighting rod.
          Unless it's made out of plastic.
   Bart:  [intense flash of light from TV] Nope, metal.
   -- ``''
   
 In front of the Simpsons' house, Lisa is sworn in as the new Little
 Miss Springfield to great media hubbub.
   
   Dave:  Doctor, what is Amber's condition?
   Dr. H: Oh, she'll be fine.  In fact, she already won the Little Miss
          Intensive Care pageant.
   -- ``''
   
 Jack Larson places the smoking tiara on Lisa's head, and Krusty
 presents her with her sceptre.  But he keeps pulling it away as she
 reaches for it.  A bolt of lightning strikes the sceptre.  As smoke
 wafts from his body, Krusty admits, ``I deserved that.''

 [End of Act Two.]

 Lisa poses by a wax figure of herself at the Springfield Wax Museum.
 In response to Bart's comment, the attendant admits that the torso
 used to be Dr. Ruth, whose head is now on a pike at the chamber of
 horrors, joining Mr. T and Ronald Reagan.

 In the school's cafeteria, Lisa (wearing crown) walks pass several
 boys, who wave and whistle in admiration.
   
   Lisa:  [coyly] Hi, fellaaass.
   Chuck: [after she leaves] Love that chewing gum walk.
   Ralph: Ve-ry Wrigley.  [both boys toast their pints of milk]
   -- Can't be chewsy, ``''
   
 Lisa welcomes a boatload of immigrants to America, only to learn
 that they're being deported.

 At Fort Springfield, Bob Hope, armed with the name of the town mayor
 and golf club, takes the stage.
   
   Hello, this is Bob ``What the hell am I doing in Springfield?'' Hope.
   -- ``''
   
 After a typical Bob Hope joke...
   
   I want to show you what you're fighting for, if there was a war on.
   -- Bob Hope entertains the troops at Fort Springfield,
      ``''
   
 He introduces Little Miss Springfield.  Having expected a more
 mature Miss Springfield, the servicemen are a mite peeved.  (``First
 Tony Randall cancels, now this!'')  They rush the stage, but Lisa
 and Bob Hope make their escape on a helicopter.

 Lisa is introduced to the Little Miss Springfield float for the
 Springfield Founders Festival Parade:  A pack of cigarettes.  What's
 more, she's become the unwitting spokesmodel for their cigarettes.
   
   You see, Lisa, it's been an unlucky year for Laramie.  A lot of the
   people who smoke our product have been [waving hand] well... dying.
   -- Jack Larson, ``''
   
 Lisa will be used to target younger customers.  Moreover, they're
 considering retiring Menthol Moose.  A cool-ly dressed moose
 character takes a drag on his cigarette and coughs horribly.

 I love a parade.  Homer, Marge, and Maggie are lost in the crowd of
 spectators.  Homer salutes the ice-cream men marching past.  Next up
 is the Laramie's float, with Lisa sitting atop the giant pack of
 cigarettes while Menthol Moose tosses free samples to the crowd.
 Lisa is shocked to see everyone smoking, even the kids.  Even Maggie
 replaces her pacifier with a cigarette.  Lisa demands, ``Stop this
 float!'', and it does.  (Santa Claus crashes into them from behind.)
 Refusing to be a corporate shill, Lisa kicks the pack of cigarettes
 and vows to speak out against the evils in society, ``from
 dog-napping to cigarettes!''

 Springfield Shopper headline:  LISA KICKS BUTT.

 A football stadium.
   
   Before I sing the national anthem, I'd like to say that college football
   diverts funds that are badly-needed for education and the arts!
   -- Lisa, ``''
   
 Thus inspired, a quartet of nerds charge the field.

 Springfield Shopper headline:  QUEEN TO MAYOR: YOU'RE NEXT.
 Second story reads, ``Nerds pummeled in football melee''.

 In a smoke-filled room, Mayor Quimby demands that Lisa Simpson be
 dethroned and Amber Dempsey restored.  Chief Wiggum is more
 interested in a bag of Bar-B-Q potato chips.  Jack Larson bursts in
 with incriminating evidence:  Lisa's pageant application.  Their
 prayers have been answered.

 Kent Brockman reports that Lisa Simpson is no longer Little Miss
 Springfield.  The intended footage of the unceremonious
 crown-stripping is replaced by a goat being bottle-fed.
   
   The father of the deposed beauty queen, Homer Simpson, filled out
   the pageant application incorrectly.  In the area under `do not write in this
   space' he wrote `OK'.
   -- Kent Brockman's report, ``''
   
 Homer and Lisa watches the report at home.  Homer takes full
 responsibility.
   
   Lisa:  Dad, do you remember why you entered me in that pageant?
   Homer: I dunno.  Was I drunk?
   Lisa:  Possibly.
   -- ``''
   
 ``But the point is you wanted me to feel better about myself, and I
 do.''  Homer asks, ``Will you remember this the next time I wreck
 your life?''  Lisa agrees.

 The news continues with Kent's exclusive interview with Pope
 John Paul II.  But all that we get is the goat footage.  Kent leaves
 in a huff.

 EPISODE TITLE: Itchy and Scratchy:  The Movie


EPISODE SUMMARY: 

   

 Space: The Final Frontier.  These are the voyages of the Starship
 Enterprise.  Her mission:  Maintaining bladder control.
   
   Captain's Log, Stardate 6051: Had trouble sleeping last night; my
   hiatal hernia is acting up.  The ship is drafty and damp.  I complain,
   but nobody listens.
   -- ``Star Trek XII:  So Very Tired'', ``''
   
   Sulu: Captain, Klingons off the starboard bow.
   Kirk: [covering his face in annoyance]  Again with the Klingons...
   -- ``Star Trek XII:  So Very Tired'', ``''
   
 Kirk asks for full power, but Scotty has gotten so fat, he cannot
 reach the control panel.
   
   Movies!  What a rip-off!  I don't have to stand here and take this.
   I... [zzzzzzz]
   -- Grampa Simpson, ``''
   
 Marge and Homer head out.
   
   Marge: Now be good for Grampa while we're at the parent-teacher meeting.
          We'll bring back dinner.
   Lisa:  What are we gonna have?
   Homer: Well, that depends on what your teachers say.  If you've been
          good, pizza.  If you've been bad... uh... let's see... poison.
   Lisa:  What if one of us has been good and one of us has been bad?
   Bart:  Poison pizza.
   Homer: Oh, no!  I'm not making two stops!
   -- ``''
   
 In the car, Homer suggests he talk to Lisa's teacher while Marge
 talks to Bart's.  Marge complains, ``That's the way we do it &lt;every&gt;
 year!''
   
   Homer: I'm thinking of a number between one and fifty.
   Marge: Is it 37?
   Homer: D'oh! ... I mean.... No.
   -- A numbers racket, ``''
   
 Marge gives in, and Homer celebrates by honking the car horn,
 flashing the headlights, and chanting, ``U-S-A!  U-S-A!  U-S-A!''

 Welcome to ``Parent-Teacher Night: Let's Share the Blame''.  Homer
 sucks in his gut to sit in Lisa's chair, and while Miss Hoover's
 back is turned, he makes armpit noises.  Meanwhile, Ms. Krabappel
 presents evidence to Marge, including a Krusty doll with a knife
 hidden beneath its head.
   
   Bart has been guilty of the following atrocities:
   Synthesizing a laxative from peas and carrots.
   Replacing my birth-control pills with Tic-Tacs.
   -- Mrs. Krabappel reads the charges, ``''
   
 Miss Hoover commends Homer on how well he raised Lisa.  ``You
 must've read to her at a young age.''  Flash back to Homer reading
 the TV Guide to baby Lisa.
   
   Well, I've always been a firm believer in the three R's.
   Reading TV Guide, um...  Writing to TV Guide, um... and Renewing TV Guide.
   -- Homer Simpson's guide to raising children,
      ``''
   
 Ms. Krabappel calls in a student and shows him a doll.  ``Now, where
 did Bart stick the firecracker.''  Marge gasps in horror at the
 response.

 Grampa is still asleep.  His dentures detach from his gums, and Bart
 removes them from his mouth, putting them into his own.  The result
 amuses Lisa and scares Maggie.

 Mrs. Hoover gives Homer a bumper sticker.
   
   ``My child is on the honor roll at Springfield Elementary''.
   You know, I thought I'd never find a replacement for my `Where's the Beef?'
   bumper sticker.
   -- Homer, ``''
   
 Homer nearly walks away with the desk still wrapped around his gut.

 At home, Lisa puts Khatchaturian's Sabre Dance on the phonograph
 while Bart swings overhead, his teeth clamped to the ceiling fan.
 Bart's grip loosens, and he falls off.

 Marge writes...
   
   I will try to raise a better child.
   -- Marge's blackboard punishment, ``''
   
 Ms. Krabappel suggests disiplining Bart when he does something
 wrong.  Marge explains that Bart always tricks them into thinking
 they've punished him, when in fact they caved in completely.
   
   He's the boy you love to hate!
   -- Homer on Bart, ``''
   
   Ms. Krabappel: I believe that with persistent discipline, even the
                  poorest student can end up becoming, oh, say, Chief
                  Justice of the Supreme Court.
   Homer:         Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.  What great men he
                  would join.  John Marshall, Charles Evans Hughes, 
                  Warren Burgher...  Mmmmmmm... Burgher...
   -- Don't forget Justice Frankfurter, ``''
   
 Without discipline, there's no telling how low Bart can sink.  Marge
 imagines Bart as an unshaven overweight male stripper failing to
 entertain his audience.

 Bart uses Grampa's dentures to take bites out of vinyl records.
 When he hears the car pull into the drive, Bart accidentally spits
 out Grampa's dentures, then hastily tapes them together, and stuffs
 them in Grampa's mouth just as Homer and Marge come in the front
 door.
   
   Boy, time really flies when you're reading... [sees what he's holding]
   The Bible!?  Ewww....
   -- Bart, ``''
   
 Marge and Homer carry pizzas.  Grampa is incoherent since his teeth
 are all screwed up.
   
   Homer:  If you don't start making more sense, we're going to have to
           put you in a home.
   Grampa: You already put me in a home.
   Homer:  Then we'll put you in the crooked home we saw on Sixty Minutes!
   Grampa: [meekly] I'll be good.
   -- ``''
   
 Dinner-time.  Grampa complains that Bart mangled his teeth, but
 Homer doesn't believe him.  Marge points out that this is exactly
 what Ms. Krabappel was talking about, letting Bart get away
 unpunished.  Homer can't bring himself to punishing the poor boy,
 but he gives in.
   
   Young man, since you broke Grampa's teeth, he gets to break yours.
   -- Homer's punishment for Bart, ``''
   
 Grampa can't wait.  ``Oh, this is gonna be sweet!''  Marge sends
 Bart to bed without supper, but Bart knows they'll cave in
 eventually.

 Later that evening, Bart sits at a card table set up in his room,
 knife and fork in hand, begging for food.  Homer rushes up the
 stairs with the pizza.  ``I'm a-comin' boy!''  Marge calls Homer
 back downstairs.  Bart scavenges his room for any edibles and turns
 his attention to Santa's Little Helper...

 Lights out.  Bart sits on his bed.  ``Gee, maybe they mean it this
 time.  From now on, I guess I'd better straighten up and fly...''
 Homer comes in with the pizza box.  ``Don't tell your mother.  Just
 promise me you'll try to be good.''  Bart does so, but once Homer
 leaves, he chuckles, ``Sucker!''

 At Springfield Retirement Castle, Jasper catches Grampa trying to
 swipe his dentures.

 [End of Act One.  Time: 7:51]

 Lisa sees a television advert for the upcoming Itchy and Scratchy
 Movie, calling Bart in from the kitchen, where Bart had been melting
 a plastic James Bond doll in the microwave, while gently stroking
 Snowball II.  The advertisement for the Itchy and Scratchy Movie
 continues.  Homer asks Bart if he took out the garbage; Bart claims
 he did.  The goats in the kitchen prove otherwise.
   
   Homer: Boy, you're gonna have to be punished for this.
   Bart:  Dad, you &lt;could&gt; punish me, but that means you have to think
          of a punishment, sit here and make sure I do it...
   Homer: [whining]  Aw...
   Bart:  Or... you could let me go play with Milhouse, while you 
          spend the afternoon watching unpredictable Mexican sit-coms.
          [turns on the TV.  Bumble-Bee Man is on]
   Homer: Hee hee hee.  Run along, you little scamp.
   -- The art of persuasion, ``''
   
 A blood-spouting billboard spews (hopefully fake) cat blood into a
 newlywed couple's open convertible.  They take it in good humor.

 Homer finds Bart hammering mustard packets into the carpet.  Homer
 will not be fooled by Bart's trickery, but he is distracted by an
 approaching ice-cream truck.  By the time he purchases ice cream for
 himself and Bart, he doesn't remember what they were talking about.
   
   The trick is to say you're prejudiced against all races.
   -- Homer's tips on getting out of jury duty, ``''
   
 Homer drinks a can of that wonderful Duff while Bart rips up the
 carpet.  Marge and Lisa return from the grocery.
   
   We got beets!
   -- Lisa, ``''
   
 When Marge sees the destruction Bart is up to, she demands that
 Homer punish him.  Homer sends Bart to his room, but Bart just goes
 out the front door.
   
   Marge: Do you want your son to become become Chief Justice of the
          Supreme Court, or a sleazy male stripper?
   Homer: Can't he be both, like the late Earl Warren?
   Marge: Earl Warren wasn't a stripper!
   Homer: &lt;Now&gt; who's being na\"{\i}ve?
   -- ``''
   
 Homer promises that next time, he'll follow through on the punishment.
   
   Kent: Tonight on ``Eye on Springfield'', we meet a man who's been hiccupping
         for 45 years!
   Man:  [hic!]  Kill me!  [hic] Kill me!
   -- ``''
   
 But first, a look at the making of the Itchy and Scratchy Movie,
 premi\`ering today.
   
   I'm here, live in Korea, to give you a first-hand look at how American
   cartoons are made!
   -- Kent Brockman, ``''
   
 First is a history of Itchy
 and Scratchy.  The violence was inherent in the system.  Maggie
 wanders off while Lisa and Bart enjoy the cartoon.  The documentary
 continues.
   
   Homer: Bart, didn't I ask you to watch Maggie?
   Bart:  Sounds like something you'd say...
   -- ``''
   
 Bart discovers Maggie missing.  We see that Maggie is driving (yes,
 driving, for real) Homer's car down the street.  She, of course,
 fails to observe basic traffic rules.  Marge drives past in the
 opposite direction.  Maggie's car goes past the Springfield cops,
 who thinks it's cute.  When Maggie cuts off another driver, the
 driver makes an obscene gesture at Maggie, who returns the
 compliment.  The car finally slams into the Springfield Correctional
 Institute, the air bag breaking Maggie's fall, and providing a
 convenient pillow for her afternoon nap.  Inmates (including Snake)
 escape.

 Bart is called before Homer, while Marge and Lisa check on Maggie.
 Homer has decided on a punishment: Bart cannot watch the Itchy and
 Scratchy Movie.  &lt;Ever&gt;.  Snake runs past with a VCR under his arm.
   
   Oh no!  Beta!
   -- Snake inspects his haul, ``''
   
 [End of Act Two.  Time: 14:51]

 Bart begs for a spanking rather than being deprived of his movie,
 going so far as dropping his pants, ready for action.  ``Don't point
 that thing at me!''  Lisa pleads for clemency in the face of ``the
 defining event of our generation.''  Lisa compares it to missing the
 moon landing.  Homer recalls the moment.  While Neil Armstrong
 stepped off the Eagle, Homer was listening to the stereo.  Homer
 stands his ground on the issue of punishment.

 The line for the Itchy and Scratchy Movie runs for miles, the tail
 of the queue ending in front of the Simpsons' house.  Bart watches
 forlornly.
   
   Homer: Someday you'll thank me for this, son.
   Bart:  Not bloody likely.
   -- ``''
   
   Homer: You know, when I was a boy, I really wanted a catcher's mitt,
          but my dad wouldn't get it for me.  So I held my breath until
          I passed out and banged my head on the coffee table.
          [cheerily] The doctor thought I might have brain damage.
   Bart:  Dad, what's the point of this story?
   Homer: [cheerily] I like stories.
   -- ``''
   
 Homer offers to let Bart watch anything he wants on TV.
   
   TV sucks.
   -- Bart, ``''
   
 Bored with public television, Bart decides to use his imagination.
 He imagines Itchy and Scratchy.  Not doing anything.  Lisa returns
 from the movie, covered head-to-toe with paraphernalia, gleeful from
 having seen ``the greatest movie of my life!''
   
   You wouldn't believe the celebrities who did cameos!
   Dustin Hoffman, Michael Jackson.
   Of course, they didn't use their real names, but you
   could tell it was them.
   -- Lisa watches... ``''
   
 Bart reads ``Itchy and Scratchy: The Movie: The Novel'' by Norman
 Mailer, but it isn't the same.  Milhouse and Nelson have seen the
 movie 30 times between them.

 Two months later,
 Homer's television watching is interrupted by Marge and Lisa.
   
   Marge: Homer, I'd like to talk to you.
   Homer: But then I won't be watching TV!
   -- ``''
   
 They plead for clemency.
   
   Lisa:  He has the demented melancholy of a Tennessee Williams heroine!
   Homer: Don't you think I know that?
   -- Well, honestly... No, ``''
   
 Homer refuses to give in.

 Bart sneaks to the theater and tries to buy a ticket, but there is a
 sign in the booth, ``Do not sell to this boy'', which thwarts him.

 Eight months later, Itchy and Scratchy Movie concludes its run.
 The blood-spurting Itchy and Scratchy billboard is now a billboard
 for Springfield Barber College.
 Bart and Homer sit on the couch.  Bart admits, ``I guess you won,''
 but Homer corrects him. ``We both won.''  Homer explains that he set
 Bart on the track to something very special...

 Forty years later, Chief Justice Bart Simpson and his father Homer
 walk down the street past the movie theater.  The theme is
 ``Classics of Animation'', featuring the Itchy and Scratchy Movie.
 (Second billing is Beauty and the Beast.)  Bart suggests seeing the
 movie, and Homer agrees.
   
   One senior citizen and one Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.
   -- Justice Bart Simpson buys movie tickets, ``''
   
 The tickets cost $650.  On the way in, Homer overhears a man
 ordering a Soylent Green, hold the butter.
   
   Mmm... Soylent Green.
   -- Homer, ``''
   
 The two Simpsons seat themselves in the theater.  Another
 fantastically absurd cartoon proceeds.  Homer asks, ``Which one's
 the mouse?''  Bart answers, ``Itchy.''  ``Itchy's a jerk.''
 ``Yeah.''

 Itchy and Scratchy


 Television advertisement


 Intro


Scratchy stands there with his tongue protruding slightly, as is its wont.
Itchy abuses the cat as follows:

    - Poking its eyes.
    - Shaving its scalp down the middle.
    - Scribbling across its face with a marker.
    - Firing a flame thrower through its ears.
    - Making bunny-ears behind its head.
    - Blowing off the top of its skull with a cannon.
    - Gleefully tearing its brains apart and tossing them every which way.

 Suspense!


In a sawmill, Itchy has tied Scratchy to a log on a conveyer belt
which slowly sends him head-first into a spinning circular saw.
Standard silent movie tactics.  Itchy waits impatiently, then, fed up
with the delay, grabs an axe and chops the cat into pieces.

 Romance!


Itchy introduces Scratchy to a female cat, obviously constructed from
dynamite and a bowling ball.  Scratchy goes gaga, sidles up, and
plants a kiss on the ersatz-feline.  The cat detonates.  Among the
body parts that remain are Itchy's eyes (still blinking) and a romance
heart slowly wafting down.

 Billboard


Itchy slams a film camera into the back of Scratchy's neck.
Scratchy's head falls off and blood spurts out.

 That Happy Cat (black-and-white)


Proto-Scratchy walks down the street, happily whistling a tune.
Scratchy is wearing a hat, has gloves on his paws, and generally looks
absolutely nothing like the modern Scratchy.

 Steamboat Itchy (black-and-white)


Itchy (visually indistinguishable from the early Mickey Mouse)
cheerfully pilots a steamboat down the river.  Scratchy joins him, and
all is blissful.  Itchy suddenly reaches down, pulls out a machine
gun, and shoots off Scratchy's kneecaps.  Scratchy falls to his knees
and crawls around in pain with his eyes closed.  Itchy politely opens
the furnace grate, as Scratchy (trailing blood) crawls into it.  Itchy
kicks Scratchy in the butt and slams the grate shut to secure the
cat's fate.  Itchy laughs as the cat's body writhes in agony.  After a
suitable amount of time, Itchy opens the grate and pulls out
Scratchy's head, which has burnt to a crisp.  Itchy says, ``Oh me, oh my!''

 World War II era cartoon


Itchy and Scratchy have the Tom and Jerry look and feel.  Adolf Hitler
gives his salute, and the cat and mouse proceed to pummel him,
Scratchy with a mallet, Itchy with a log, Scratchy with a giant
wrench, and Itchy gives the final blow, decapitating the F\"uhrer with
an axe.  Sousa's ``Stars and Stripes Forever'' continues to play as
the cat and mouse shake hands, then Itchy chops off Scratchy's head.
The classic tongue comes out.  A cartoon Roosevelt dances on-screen
(the music changes to ``Happy Days Are Here Again'') and kicks what's
left of Hitler and Scratchy in the rear end.  Itchy holds a sign,
``Save Scrap Iron''.

 The Itchy and Scratchy Movie


The standard intro sequence, except ``The Itchy and Scratchy Show''
changes to ``The Itchy and Scratchy Movie''.  Itchy ties Scratchy to
the railroad tracks and runs for a waiting train.  But the train
engineer won't let Itchy into the engine car.  So Itchy enrols in
Engineer School.  ``The Big Book of Trains'' and ``The Civil
Engineer'' are the texts.  (Does ``The Civil Engineer'' explain how to
stick out your pinky while drawing diagrams?)  Itchy receives his
diploma, tosses his cap into the air, hangs his diploma on the wall
(between pictures of his parents), admires it briefly, then rushes to
a Union Pacific office, fills the ``Engineer Wanted'' position, and
hops into the engine of the train.  By this time, Scratchy has nearly
extricated himself, but alas not quite in time.  After the train runs
him over, all that's left of the cat are his arms and the leg still
tied to the tracks.

Didja notice...  the mouse hole in Itchy's wainscotting!

 Soylent Green


Soylent Green is the title of a movie set in an overpopulated 21st
century.  To feed the masses, the government provides a foodstuff
called ``soylent green''.  At the end of the movie, Charlton Heston
discovers that soylent green is made of people.

Ethan Miller @{elm} points out that in the original book, ``Make Room,
Make Room'' by Harry Harrison, soylent green was made of &lt;soy&gt;beans
and &lt;lent&gt;ils.  Only in the movie version were the ingredients sinister.

 Springfield Nuclear Power Plant is throwing a retirement party.
 Lying on the couch, Homer dreams on his own retirement:  Lying on
 the couch.  Ned stops by the window to chat about the weather, but
 Homer tells him to buzz off.
   
   Oakley-Doakley-Do! 
   -- Ned Flanders, ``''
   
 (Inside joke alert.)  Marge notes that Ned was standing slanted in
 the window, but Homer merely dismisses it as ``part of God's Great
 Plan.''  Maggie and her toys inexplicably slide across the floor,
 drawn towards a fan.  She crawls for dear life, inches away from the
 swirling blades.  Homer saves her.  Marge suspects one side of the
 house is sinking, and she's right.  Various objects fall off the roof.

 Homer watches a videotape titled ``The Half-Assed Approach to
 Foundation Repair''.  (The cover of the tape depicts half of a
 donkey.)
   
   Hello, I'm Troy McClure.  You might remember me from such instructional
   videos as ``Mothballing Your Battleship'' and ``Dig Your Own Grave, And Save!''
   -- ``''
   
   Now, over the next six hours, I'll be going over the Do's and Do-Not-Do's
   of foundation repair.
   -- Troy McClure's instructional video, ``''
   
   Troy:    Now, do you hav extruded poly-vinyl foam insulation?
   Homer:   No.
   Troy:    Good.
   -- Homer improvement, ``''
   
 But it looks so much easier on TV.

 Surly Joe's Foundation Repair pays a visit, and Surly Joe estimates
 that the repairs will cost $8500.  Homer is furious.  ``Forget it!
 You're not the &lt;only&gt; foundation guy in town!''  Homer consults the
 Yellow Pages.  ``Surly Joe's Fondation Repair: The &lt;only&gt; foundation
 repair company in town.''
   
   ... leaving the Vice President in charge.
   -- Kent Brockman's news report, ``''
   
 On the lighter side of the news is the Leaning Casa de Simpson.  The
 house has become a tourist attraction.  As a Japanese family gets
 their picture taken by the house, Bart plays sideshow barker for the
 ``Slanty Shanty'', directing the tourists' attention to ``Cue-Ball,
 the man with no hair!''  The tourists gasp in horror.  (``He's
 hideous!'')
   
   Marge, it'll cost eighty-five hundred dollars!
   We only have five hundred in the bank, 
   and that leaves... eighty-hundred we need.
   -- Carry the ten, ``''
   
 Marge suggests she could get a job, and Homer considers his dream of
 living in the woods, keeping a journal of his thoughts.
   
   March 15th.  I wish I brought a TV.  Oh God, how I miss TV!
   -- Homer's journal of life in the woods, ``''
   
 The retirement party for Jack Marley is held at the ``Spruce
 Caboose''.  After a brief introduction by Mr. Burns, Smithers
 launches into a vaudeville-style tribute to... Mr. Burns.
   
   Marley: You mind if I say a few words?
   Burns:  Oh, me-me-me, ``I want all the attention because it's &lt;my&gt; party'', eh?
   -- Will the honored guest please shut up, ``''
   
 Marley's speech begging for a stay of his retirement is met by two
 bodyguards, who toss him off the train.  Burns announces the opening
 of an entry-level position in sector 7-G, then sends everyone home.
 Marge suggests she apply for the job, but Homer will hear nothing of
 it.

 The weight of a bird on the chimney causes the house to sink
 further, tossing Bart out his bedroom window.  (He lands on his
 head.)

 [End of Act One.  Time: 5:37]

 Marge composes her r\'esum'e.
   
   \&lt;
    : Marge Simpson
    : Resume
    :
    : Homemaker: 1980 to present
   \&gt;
   -- It's my job, and I'll apply if I want to, ``''
   
 Lisa remarks, ``I think it needs a little padding.''  Lisa gives
 Marge such illustrious titles as chauffeur, seamstress, and curator
 of large mammals.  (Homer asks, ``Marge, have you seen my
 lunchbox?''  It's on the table.)

 Smithers is dutifully impressed by Marge's r\'esum\'e and hires her.
   
   Smithers:  This r\'esum\'e is very impressive.  Let me be the first to say
              ``Abibu gazini''.
   Marge:     What?
   Smithers:  ``Welcome aboard''.  I guess my Swahili's not as good as yours.
   -- What's Swahili for ``Good idea, boss''?  ``''
   
 Among the disappointed applicants is Jack Marley.

 Homer disapproves of the situation, but when he talks himself into a
 corner, he quickly picks up the newspaper.  ``Canada to hold
 referendum.''  Marge explains that they need the money, and besides,
 she needs to find something to do.
   
   Last week, some Jeohvah's Witnesses came to the door,
   and I wouldn't let them leave.  They snuck away when
   I went into the kitchen to get more lemonade.
   -- Marge, ``''
   
   Lisa:  You'll be just like Marie and Pierre Curie.
   Homer: What'd they do?
   Lisa:  They discovered radium!  Then they both died of radiation poisoning.
   --  ``''
   
 Bart imagines the Godzilla-sized Curies terrorizing downtown Tokyo.

 The Simpsons go to work.
   
   Now, Marge, just remember.  If something goes wrong at the plant,
   blame the guy who can't speak English.  Ah, Tibor, how many times have
   you saved my butt?
   -- Homer's rules for success in the workplace, ``''
   
 Maggie leans against her crib, trying to reach her bottle of
 formula.  Despite all her effort to convey her point, Grampa can't
 figure out what she wants; he thinks she's ill.

 Smithers shows Marge to her office.  Tibor lost the keys, but he
 jimmies the lock with a credit card.
   
   Marge:	  What do I do?
   Smithers: Heh, heh, heh.  Marge, please!
   	  According to your r\'esum\'e you &lt;invented&gt; this machine.
   -- I can't believe I invented it!  ``''
   
 Marge tentatively presses a button.  In the hallway is an explosion.
 Marge quickly pulls her hand back.

 To get out of taking an English test, Bart fakes a stomach-ache.
   
   Mrs. K: Bart, have you ever read ``The Boy Who Cried Wolf''?
   Bart:   I'm halfway through it, I swear!
   -- That's the one with Little Red Riding Hood and the three pigs, right?
      ``''
   
 Homer drags Marge away from her paperwork for lunch.  He takes her
 form, puts it into a canister, and sends it through the pneumatic
 tube system.  The canister takes a wild ride through the tube
 system, eventually being deposited... outside, where a nearby beaver
 collects it and adds it to a dam built entirely of message canisters.

 At home, Bart suffers through Grampa's home remedies.
   
   Grampa: Good news, boy!  I found a pharmacy that carries leeches!
           Well it wasn't exactly a pharmacy... more of a bait shop.
   -- ``''
   
   Oral thermometer, my eye!
   -- Grampa, ``''
   
 Monty Burns surveys his troops and immediately succumbs to the
 quiet charms of Marge sitting at her console, carefully not pressing
 any buttons.
   
   Burns:  I must have her!  Smithers, zoom in.
           Closer!  Closer!  Closer, dammit!
   	[the camera hits Marge in the forehead]
   Marge:  Ow!
   Burns:  Too close.
   -- ``''
   
 [End of Act Two.  Time: 10:45]

 Monty Burns pays a surprise visit to his favorite new employee,
 lavishing gifts upon her.  Marge wonders why morale is so low,
 indicating several very disturbed employees.
   
   I am the Angel of Death.  The Time of Purification is at hand.
   -- ``''
   
 Marge suggests theme days, like ``Funny Hat Day'', and piping in Tom
 Jones music.

 The same employees are just as disturbed as ever.  The only
 difference is that they're wearing funny hats and listening to Tom
 Jones.  Burns continues by replacing the donuts with healthy snacks.
 A brief employee revolt is quickly quelled by a chain-wielding donut
 man.

 Burns gives Marge a raise and a new office: The one right next door,
 the office which used to be Smithers'.  Smithers is demoted to
 cleaning the urinals with a toothbrush.

 Bart has returned to school.
   
   Mrs. K:   Well, then, you're ready for your make-up test.
   Bart:     Ohhhhhh!  My ovaries.
   -- He's in more trouble than he thinks, ``''
   
 Grampa takes Bart home.
   
   Grampa:   Have you ever read ``The Boy Who Cried Wolf''?
   Bart:     I glanced at it.
   	  Boy cries wolf, has a few laughs... I forget how it ends.
   -- Selective recall, ``''
   
 Bed-time.
   
   Homer:	Ohhhhh...
   Marge:	What?
   Homer:	I'm used to seeing people promoted ahead of me.
   	Friends, co-workers, Tibor...
   	I never thought it'd be my own wife.
   Marge:	Well, maybe you'd get promoted if you worked a little harder.
   Homer:	Are you kidding?  I work like a Japanese beaver!
   Marge:	Oh, really?  I came to see you three times today.
   	Twice you were sleeping, and once you were kicking that ball of
   	electrical tape around!
   Homer:	Well!  I won't sleep in the same bed with a woman who thinks I'm lazy.
   	I'm going to go right downstairs, unfold the couch, unroll the
   	sleeping ba...  [gets into bed]  Eh, good-night.
   -- Know when to say when, ``''
   
 Homer immediately falls asleep.  Marge is wide awake.

 Burns lies on the floor like a schoolboy, watching Marge on every
 monitor.  ``You know that dream when you're in bed and they fly
 through the window?''  Smithers knows exactly what he's talking
 about, except that in Smithers' dream, it's Mr. Burns who flies in.
   
   Burns:    I want you to arrange a party for two at my estate:
   	  Marge, me, and do you think you could dig up Al Jolson?
   Smithers: Ah, do you remember we did that once before?
   -- ``''
   
 So Burns asks for Tom Jones.  Country-Western Day at the plant goes
 on without too much hubbub.  Surly Joe completes the repairs and
 tries to tell Homer that a simple fifty-cent washer would prevent
 the water leakage that caused the problem.  Homer tells him to
 scram.  In Vegas, Smithers first tries to bribe, then when that
 fails, successfully kidnaps Tom Jones.
   
   Bart, to avoid this test, you've had smallpox, the bends,
   and that unfortunate bout of Tourette's syndrome.
   -- Mrs. Krabappel, ``''
   
 ``Mo more excuses.''

 ``Meanwhile, not far away...'' at KrustyLu studios, Krusty's guest
 is a Joan Embry wannabe, introducing Krusty to a giant clawed bird,
 then an Alaskan timberwolf.  She warns that the wolf is spooked by
 loud noises.  Krusty announces that `loud' is the word of the day,
 and much noisy celebration ensues.  The wolf breaks free of its
 chains and rushes out of the studio.  Meanwhile, Krusty is attacked
 by the bird.
   
   Joan:	She must think you're after her eggs.
   Krusty: I only ate one!
   -- ``''
   
 The wolf crushes a Buzz Cola can as it walks past Eddie and Chief
 Wiggum, munching on donuts.  ``Nice doggy.''
   
   Ivanhoe is a story about a Russian farmer and his tool.
   -- Bart Simpson, ``''
   
 The wolf stares Bart in the face.  Bart cries ``Wolf'', but Ms.
 Krabappel isn't listening.

 Burns applies a generous portion of Scalp Wax as Marge enters his
 office.  (The wax on his hands provides minor amusement.)  He
 invites Marge to dinner, dancing, and Tom Jones.  (Smithers holds a
 gun to Tom Jones' back to ensure his cooperation.)  When Burns
 learns that Marge is married, he imagines what her husband must look
 like.  Then fires Marge.  Marge promises to sue his pants off.

 The wolf maintains the upper paw, until Groundskeeper Willie steps
 into the fray.  A very tattered Bart returns to class.  Ms.
 Krabappel demands to know what happened out there.  After some
 thought, Bart admits that he faked the whole thing.  ``I'm just
 going to lie on the floor, now.  Please don't let me swallow my
 tongue.''  Ms. Krabappel prods Bart with a pointer.

 Grampa takes Bart home, while Groundskeeper Willie consoles the
 wolf.

 Burns mutilates Marge's image on his surveillance monitor as she
 collects her things from her desk.  Meanwhile, Marge enlists Lionel
 Hutz to aid her in a sexual harrassment suit.  Hutz bursts into
 Burns' office claiming to have witnesses, precedent, and evidence.
 Burns in turn shows Hutz his ten high-priced lawyers.  Hutz panics
 and runs out.  Upon closer inspection, Homer discovers that Hutz's
 briefcase was filled with shredded newspaper.  Homer demands an
 apology.
   
   Burns:  I want you to show this woman the time of her life.
   Homer:	Gotcha.
   	Marge, we're getting some drive-thru, then we're doing it twice!
   -- ``''
   
 Burns has something a little more special in mind:  A special
 performance by Tom Jones, who is shackled to the stage.  He begs
 Marge for assistance, but she and Homer merely enjoy the music.

 [End of Act Three.  Time: 20:46]

 Tom Jones sings ``It's Not Unusual'' over the credits.
 Gracie credit is unchanged.

 Reviews


Alan J Rosenthal @{ajr}:  Overall evaluation: Fairly good.

J. D. Baldwin @{jdb}: I was lukewarm toward this one, but one thing
really stuck in my craw and relegated it to a permanent place in
``J.D.'s Bottom Ten'': the lame-o ending.

The only realistic (i.e., consistent with the Simpsons world-view) way
out of this one would be to have Homer saved from Burns' wrath by some
incredibly lucky twist of fate.  But to have Burns suddenly roll over
and make nice was really a deus ex machina.  The writers should be
ashamed of themselves.  [Hey, watch it, pal.  One of the writers has
net access... --rjc]

The width of Marge's floppy tie changes.

After Burns drew a goatee and horns on Marge, there was a change of scene,
followed by Burns drawing flies around her; the goatee and horns are gone.
No doubt he shifted his attention to a different monitor.

The establishing shot of SNPP when Hutz comes in is missing the
characteristic crow call.

That the Curies died of radiation poisoning is a common misconception.
(Pierre died as a result of a traffic accident, if you consider having
your head struck by a wagon wheel a traffic accident.)  Bill Oakley
admits that the error was not caught by the normally comprehensive
fact-checking team until it was too late to do anything about it.

 Comments and other observations


 Changes between original airing and syndication


The mention of ``Tourette's Syndrome'' has been changed to ``rabies''.
Story Editor Bill Oakley explains:
\C
    Though it rarely happens, the producers received several very strong
    complaints from Tourette's-afflicted children around the country and
    decided that the line might have been too insensitive.

    The change was made in consultation with the writers and staff.
\eC
Though if you listen carefully, you can hear Bart mutter ``Tourette's
Syndrome'' near the end of his diatribe.

Ohg vs gur Gbherggr ybool pnyyrq gb pbzcynva, ubj pbhyq lbh gryy vs

 Canada to Hold Referendum


The referendum had actually past (but not passed) a few weeks before
the episode aired.  For Americans whose knowledge of international
affairs end at going out for pizza, here's a quick summary: Put to a
national vote was a new Canadian constitution.  It failed miserably.
(It seemed that only the Newfies voted for it.)

It's not as easy as you think.  Imagine trying to pass a constitution
in the United States.  Special interests would tear it apart.

 Stolen Kisses


William McAdams @{wm2} identifies the pneumatic tube scene as coming
from Fran\c{c}ois Truffaut's ``Stolen Kisses'' (France 1968).  Even
the music is the same.  In the movie, Antoine mails a love letter
through a pneumatic tube, and we follow it as it travels under the
streets of Paris.

Lucy'', named for Desi Arnaz and Lucille Ball.

 The Secret Word


Grouch Marx's ``You Bet Your Life'' probably did the most to promote
the concept of the ``secret word''.

 Tourette's Syndrome


All that most people know (or think they know) about Tourette's
Syndrome is that people who have it burst into uncontrollable bouts of
swearing.  Corby Page @{cep}, who actually has Tourette's explains:
``It is not a mental illness.  It's a nervous disorder, and the way it
manifests itself varies from person to person.  For example, you can
probably catch me twitching, blinking, or making little grunting
noises every once in a while, but I've never had a problem with
swearing.''

 EPISODE TITLE: The New Kid on the Block


EPISODE SUMMARY: 

   

 Homer's viewing of the television program ``Hunks'' is interrupted by a
 visitor:  It's the next-door neighbor Mrs. Winfield, who is moving to
 Florida with her husband.  She asks Homer to do a few things to help
 her sell the house.  Like wear pants when he stands in the window.
 Homer refuses.

 While mowing the lawn, Homer is drawn to the boxes of discarded coathangers,
 old newspapers, and expired medicine.  Unable to stop himself, he takes
 them into the house.
   
   Marge: That medicine's not for you!
   Homer: [emptying assorted bottles of medicine]
          C'mon, Marge!  Maybe I'm not getting enough...
          [reads the label] estrogen.
   -- Can't get enough, uh huh, ``''
   
 The argument is interrupted by a television commercial for the
 all-you-can-eat dinner at ``The Frying Dutchman'' seafood restaurant.
   
   Homer: Marge, we're going to that restaurant.
   Marge: But I think I'm allergic to seafood.  The last time I ate shrimp,
          my throat closed up, and I went into convulsions.
   Homer: Mmm... shrimp...
   -- Mmm... convulsions... ``''
   
 The Winfields' real estate agent shows a couple the home.
   
   Wife:  Now, I don't know much about haggling or bargaining, so why don't
          we just agree to pay whatever the Winfields want.
   Agent: That could work.
   -- Flexibility is our middle name, ``''
   
 The sound of Homer's belching draws their attention, and they see Homer
 lounging in the wading pool, fishing a half-eaten weiner [sic] from
 the water, and eating it.  This changes their minds.

 Bart and Lisa tiptoe past the ``SOLD'' sign on the Winfields' front lawn
 and sneak in the basement window.  Bart preys on Lisa's anxiety by
 improvising a scary story about the Winfields.  This spooks Lisa, who
 runs off in fear.  As Bart chuckles, a shadowy figure sneaks up on our
 hero and grabs him.  Bart screams and faints.

 Blackness.

 ``Hey, kid.  Wake up.''  The 15-year-old figure introduces herself
 as the new neighbor.
   
   Laura: Are you all right?
   Bart's brain: She's beautiful.  Say something clever.
   Bart's mouth: [meekly] I fell on my bottom.
   Bart's brain: D'oh!
   -- Thinking fast on one's bottom, ``''
   
 [End of Act One.  Time: 3:29]

 As ``Clumsy Student Movers'' unload the van, Laura welcomes Marge to their
 home.  Marge is impressed by the girl's manners.

 Marge plays Welcome Mobile for the new family, adding to the promotional
 gifts a coupon for a free drink at Moe's Tavern.
   
   Woman: I actually had some doubts about moving to Springfield, especially
          after that TIME cover story, ``America's Worst City''.
   Marge: [proudly] You could see our house in that photo!
   -- Was Homer in the window without any pants on?  ``''
   
 The next item in the basket is for the man of the house, which is an
 optional extra in this 90's family, Laura's parents having divorced
 two years ago.
   
   Woman: They're so sweet when you marry them, but soon it's just career,
          career, career.
   Homer: [outside, scolding SLH] &lt;My&gt; hammock.  Do you understand?
          Mine!  ... Don't look that way!
   -- The exception that proves the rule, ``''
   
 On the front kerb, Bart and Laura exchange schoolyard stunts, and Laura's
 smart retort scares away a proto-menacing Kerny and Dolph.  Laura offers
 to read Bart's palm:  ``You're going to be rich!  There's your mansion.
 Here's the tennis court.''  She spits into Bart's hand.  ``And there's
 the swimming pool!''  Laura makes a playful escape back into the house.
 Bart admires his wet palm.  ``I'll never wash this hand again.''

 And he doesn't.  The hand is filthy, but the pool of spit remains.  Lisa
 tries to get Homer to tell Bart to wash his hand...
   
   I no longer control the hand...  The hand controls &lt;me&gt;!
   -- You have to hand it to Bart...  ``''
   
   Shut up, you little monsters!
   -- Homer tries once again to control the kids, ``''
   
 ... but Homer is busy trying to find a babysitter.
   
   Homer: I was wondering if you'd like to babysit my little angels.
   Woman: Sorry, this isn't Abby; this is her sister.  I look after her now.
   Abigail: [rocking but otherwise motionless in her rocking chair]
          [speaking to no one in particular]  No, Bart.  Put it down, Bart.
          Bart, put it down.
   -- And come out with your hands up, ``''
   
 Homer is disappointed that he wore his extra-loose pants for nothing.
 Bart suggests Laura could baby-sit, and Lisa takes the opportunity to
 tease him.  Bart lunges for her with his filthy hand, but she quickly
 steps aside, landing Bart's hand on SLH, who runs off, Bart's hand
 sticking like glue.

 At the neighbor's house, Laura's mother agrees to let her baby-sit.
   
   Homer: Uh, and there was something else...  Something I was supposed to
          tiptoe around...
   Laura's mother: My divorce.
   Homer: &lt;That's&gt; it!  Woo-hoo!  I'm glad &lt;one&gt; of us remembered.
          &lt;That&gt; could've been embarrassing.
   -- A close call, ``''
   
   Laura's mother: Well, I know what you're thinking, and the answer is yes.
          I want to be fixed up with one of your friends as soon as you
          can arrange it.  After all, Homer, I do have the normal ... appetites.
   Homer: [knowingly] Heh, heh, heh.  I know what you mean.
          [just checking] Just let me make sure we're not talking about food.
   Laura's mother: I'm not.
   Homer: [as if he knew it all along] Right!  Me neither.
          [just checking] We're talking about sex, right?
   Laura's mother: Right.
   Homer: I hear you loud and clear!
   -- But does he understand?  ``''
   
 Lisa is surprised to find Bart... taking a bath?
   
   Hey, sometimes a guy just likes his skin to look its yellowest.
   -- Bart takes a bath, ``''
   
 Bart welcomes Laura in a velvet smoking jacket, complete with (bubble) pipe.
 Lisa and Bart leave Laura to decide what to have for dinner.
 At the empty ``Two Guys from Kabul'' restaurant, the phone rings, and the
 two guys fight over it.

 While Laura introduces the kids to take-out Afghan food, Homer and Marge
 order dinner at The Frying Dutchman.
   
   Waiter: I'm sorry, ma'am, but everything on the menu has fish in it.
   Marge:  Mmm, what about the bread?  Does that have much fish in it?
   Waiter: Yes.
   -- One slice of bread with not so much fish in it later...
      ``''
   
 Marge contents herself with some Tic-Tacs in her purse, while Homer eagerly
 orders the all-you-can-eat dinner.  Even before the waiter can give him his
 plate, Homer is at the buffet cart, carting away an entire tray of shrimp.

 At the Simpsons residence, Laura goads, ``Come on, Bart.  If I can teach
 Maggie to waltz, I can teach you.''  Maggie dances with Snowball.  Laura
 places Bart's hand on her hip, and they dance.  Bart drifts into
 fantasy-land, where he and Laura dance divinely, though Laura takes the
 opportunity to give him a wedgie at the end.

 Homer continues to gorge himself on shrimp, Marge having fallen asleep,
 and the rest of the restaurant staff waiting anxiously, as it is already
 closing time, the chairs upended.
   
   'Tis no man.  'Tis a remorseless eating machine.
   -- Captain McAlister watches Homer eat all his profits,

 Captain McAlister tries to convince Homer to leave.
   
   Can't talk.  Eating.
   -- Homer, ``''
   
 The proprietor finally throws Homer out.  It takes two attempts.

 Marge lies in bed, but Homer is furious and wants to make an issue out of
 the incident.
   
   Homer: This is my quest.  I'm like that guy.  That Spanish guy.
          You know, he fought the windmill...
   Marge: Don Quixote?
   Homer: No, that's not it.  What's-his-name, the Man of La Mancha.
   Marge: Don Quixote.
   Homer: No!
   Marge: I really think that was the character's name.  Don Quixote.
   Homer: Fine!  I'll look it up!  [heads off and consults a reference]
   Marge: [annoyed] Well, who was it?
   Homer: [quietly fuming]  Nevermind.

 At the Kwik-E-Mart, Bart plays backseat driver as Laura plays ``Death Row''.
 Upon reaching the Conservative Judge, the Insanity Plea fails to work, so
 Bart suggests a Change of Venue.  Unfortunately, it changed to the Texas
 electric chair.  ``If I'd hit the Remorse button one more time I would'a
 made it.''
   
   Ceiling mirrors and video cameras sometimes see more than
   who is about to shoot me.
   -- Apu, ``''
   
 Homer pays a visit to Lionel Hutz's ``I Can't Believe It's a Law Firm''
 law firm.
   
   Homer: All you can eat.  Ha!
   Hutz:  Mr. Simpson, this is the most blatant case of fraudulent advertising
          since my suit against the film, ``The Never-Ending Story''.
   -- ``''
   
   Homer: So, do you think I have a case?
   Hutz:  I don't use the word hero very often, but you are the greatest hero
          in American history.
   Homer: Woo-hoo!
   -- I'm sorry, did I say `hero'?  I meant `zero'.
      ``''
   
 Bart pays a visit to Grampa (coincidentally, on the elder Simpson's
 birthday), asking for advice on older women, but it doesn't seem to be
 much help.  In a move betraying his lack of brain cells, Bart turns to
 Homer for advice.  Homer tries to act busy, but Marge insists that
 Homer talk to Bart about... you-know...  Homer believes Bart should learn
 the same way he did, then reconsiders.  Marge leaves the two alone.
   
   Son, a woman is a lot like a... [looks around]  a refrigerator!
   They're about six feet tall, 300 pounds.  They make ice, and... um...
   [spots his can of Duff] Oh, wait a minute.  Actually, a woman is more
   like a beer.  They smell good, they look good, you'd step over
   your own mother just to get one!  [downs the beer]  But you can't stop at
   one.  You wanna drink another woman!  [gets another woman out of the woman]
   -- Homer teaches Bart about the birds and the beers,
      ``''
   
 Many women later, Homer babbles incoherently, then passes out.

 Bart lies unhappily in bed.  ``How can I get her to notice me?''
 Laura opens Bart's bedroom window.  ``Meet me at the treehouse, Bart.
 And come alone.''  She vanishes.  Bart swallows hard.

 Bart paces nervousely in the treehouse, then turns around to see Laura
 in a heart-stopping red dress.  She explains, ``I'm so happy, I just had
 tell someone.  I have a boyfriend.''  Bart reacts with stunned horror,
 envisioning Laura tearing his heart out of his chest and drop-kicking
 it into the trashcan.

 [End of Act Two.  Time: 13:34]

 And to rub salt in the wound, Laura's boyfriend is Jimbo.  Bart flashes
 back to another of Jimbo's abuses.
   
   Bart:  How can you like that guy?
   Laura: I dunno.  Maybe because he's an outlaw.
          You know that dead body they found behind the mayor's house?
   Bart:  Jimbo killed him?
   Laura: No.  [dramatically]  But he poked him with a stick.
   -- ``''
   
 Jimbo, the self-proclaimed ``Dr. Tongue'', arrives on his motorcycle to
 pick up Laura.  ``Who's the dork?''  ``Leave him alone.  He's just a kid.''
 Laura's words echo in Bart's head.
   
   Bart:  I'll show &lt;them&gt; who's ``just a kid''!
   Marge: [calling] Bart, bedtime!  I laid out your jammy-jams!
   -- ``''
   
 At dinner, everyone digs into light grey goop with gusto, save Bart,
 who has no appetite.  Bart's request for advice fails to work.

 Homer and Marge leave the kids in Laura's care...
   
   Lisa: Good luck in your trumped-up lawsuit, Dad.
   Homer: [hugs her] Thanks.  That means a lot to me.
   -- ``''
   
 Laura tells the kids to be in bed before Jimbo arrives.
   
   Bart: What do you like about him?  He's just a good-looking rebel
         who plays by his own rules.
   Lisa+Laura: [wistful sigh]
   -- ``''
   
 At Night Court, Captain McAlister presents his testimony, though undermined
 by the fact that he's not really a captain.  The defense attorney offers
 to show the court how much shrimp Homer ate.  Aides bring in bags upon bags
 of stuff, emptying them on the judge's desk.
   
   Aide:     Eighteen thousand letters, all addressed to Santa Claus.
   Attorney: You want the People of Springfield versus Kris Kringle.
             That's next door.
   -- ``''
   
   Isn't it true that your husband consumed a ten-pound bag of flour when no
   other food was available?
   -- The defense attorney cross-examines Marge,
      ``''
   
 During the proceedings, a Domino's pizza is delivered for Homer.
 Lionel Hutz draws out of Marge the fact that after being thrown
 out of the restaurant, they drove around until 3am looking for
 another all-you-can-eat fish restaurant, and failing that, they
 went fishing.  Marge collapses in tears.  Hutz addresses the jury of
 Homer's peers (all overweight citizens).  Captain McAlister
 approaches Homer and offers a settlement.

 Marge covers her face as Homer chows down heartily on all the food
 he can eat, at the window table.  A huge crowd of onlookers have
 gathered, and Captain McAlister ushers them inside, barking, ``Come for
 the freak; stay for the food.''

 Bart eavesdrops on Jimbo and Laura on the couch, smooching.  Bart has
 a plan.  Meanwhile, Laura's mother has considerable difficulty getting
 Moe to accept the coupon for a free beer.  ``No, this is... Bo's Cavern.''
   
   Moe: [answers the phone]  Yeah, just a sec; I'll check.
        [calls]  Amanda Hugginkiss?  Hey, I'm lookin' fer Amanda Hugginkiss.
        Why can't I find Amanda Hugginkiss?
        [bar denizens laugh]
   Barney: Maybe your standards are too high!
   Moe: [to phone] You little S.O.B.  Why, when I find out who you are,
        I'm going to shove a sausage down your throat and stick starving
        dogs in your butt!
   -- ``''
   
 Bart answers, ``My name is Jimbo Jones, and I live at 1094 Evergreen
 Terrace.''  Moe celebrates victory.  ``I knew he's slip up sooner or
 later!''  He unsheathes a rusty knife and heads out of the tavern.
   
   Moe:    Barney, don't steal any beer while I'm gone.
   Barney: What kind of pathetic drunk do you take me for?
           Gasp!  Somebody spilled beer in this ashtray!  [drinks it]
   -- ``''
   
 Moe's angry dash through town is momentarily put on hold while he
 consults his map to find Evergreen Terrace.  Moe bursts into the
 Simpsons' home as Jimbo and Laura are making out.  He brandishes his
 knife, and Jimbo falls to his knees, begging and crying for mercy.
 Bart gloats, ``That's your outlaw?''  Moe leaves for the Tavern,
 where Barney is sucking beer straight from the tap, pausing briefly
 until his heart starts beating again.

 Laura shows Jimbo to the door, suggesting they not see each other any more.
 She concedes to Bart that he was right after all.
   
   As usual, a knife-wielding maniac has shown us the way.
   -- Bart, ``''
   
 ``You know, if you were only old enough to grow a bad teen-aged moustache,
 I'd go out with you in a second.''  She gives him a peck on the cheek.
   
   Laura: [on the phone]  Hello, I'd like to speak to Ms. Tinkle?  First name...
   Bart:  [whispers]
   Laura: [continues]  Ivana?
   Moe:   [on the phone]  Ivana Tinkle, just a sec.
          [calls]  Ivana Tinkle!  Ivana Tinkle!  Hey, everybody, put down your
          glasses.  Ivana Tinkle!
   -- ``''
   
 All, including Homer and Captain McAlister (who apparently stopped by the bar
 for a drink) enjoy the joke.

 Animation and continuity goofs


I wonder how Laura was able to stand up straight in Bart's treehouse,
whose ceiling is no more than five feet.  And I don't want to know how
she climbed up in a dress.

Marge calls to Bart, ``Bedtime!''  But notice that Bart was already in
his jammy-jams when musing, ``How can I get her to notice me?''  How
uncharacteristically Bart, going to bed &lt;before&gt; his bedtime.

 Comments and other observations


 Guest voices


Sara Gilbert plays Roseanne's daughter on ``Roseanne''.  (Real-life Sara
Gilbert is 16, claims KitchenRN@ssd0.laafb.af.mil.)

Pamela Reed plays a divorced parent on ``Grand''.

 Hunks


``Hunks'' is a spoof of the syndicated game show ``Studs'', with the same
host and the same set layout.  For those who are fortunate enough not to
be familiar with the program, here's a quick synopsis:  Two guys each go
out on dates with three women, then a post-mortem interview is conducted
with each of the women.  All five are brought together, and the object of
the game (What?  The game hasn't started yet?) is for the two men to
identify which of the three women said various things about them.  The
show is so inane, I don't even know what the winner gets, and I don't care.
For some inexplicable reason, the program is a hit.

The quotations are invariably charged with double entendres.  The Simpsonified
version ``Hunks'' reveals the utter stupidity of the game by disposing
with the window-dressing, leading to such quotes as, ``He looked so sexy,
I hoped we would have sex.''

 Other puns


The porno movie ``Das Butt'' follows in the naming tradition of cheap porno
movies, punning on otherwise respectable phrases or titles.  (Compare the
movies on ``The Top Hat Channel'' in [7F13].)  ``Das Boot'' is, of course,
the classic German U-boat movie.

And only the culturally illiterate wouldn't recognize ``The Frying Dutchman''
as a pun on the legend of The Flying Dutchman.

 The pizza guy


The pizza deliverly boy was dressed in the colors of Domino's Pizza, an
American chain of delivery pizza, whose drivers are notorious for pushing
the limits of American traffic regulations in order to deliver their wares
within the ``30-minutes or it's free'' deadline.

 Top Hat


Tom Purcia@{tp} identifies Bart's dream dance sequence as coming from
The Astaire/Rogers movie ``Check to Check.''  (I assume he meant ``Cheek
to Cheek.'')

 Miscellaneous


Mrs. Winfield's voice has softened considerably.

Marge's allergy to seafood must be a relatively recent development, since
she ate at Chez Paree's (``Some Enchanted Evening''), the Rusty Barnacle
(``Homer's Night Out''), and The Happy Sumo (``One Fish...'') with no
visible ill effects.

It looks like Maggie was doing something closer to a cha-cha than a waltz.

The best part was the nine-frame ``family dinner'' scene-let.

Marge wasn't wearing lipstick in court.

 Boring distribution restrictions


Yeah, right.

EPISODE SUMMARY: 

   

 Television.
   
   Live, from Hawaii's beautiful Malaki Island (``We're not just for lepers
   any more''), it's ``Carnival of the Stars''!
   -- Troy McClure hosts another stupid television show, ``''
   
   I'm your host, Troy McClure.  You may remember me from such films as
   ``The Erotic Adventures of Hercules'' and ``Dial M for Murderousness''!
   -- Troy McClure hosts another stupid television show, ``''
   
 Homer watches from Moe's Tavern.  Krusty's tiger-taming act runs into some
 unfortunate problems (``Not the face!''), so Bart and Lisa (watching at
 home) switch to that Mexican television program about the guy dressed in a
 bee suit.  Meanwhile, Marge calls and asks Homer to come home, since it is
 starting to snow.  Homer can't see through his windshield it is snowing so
 hard, and cannot stop in time to avoid rear-ending another car.  He gets out
 of the car, the car's air bag inflates, and Homer takes pleasure in the fact
 that the other car is damaged as badly as his own.  Until he realizes that
 he is standing in his own driveway.  He hit Marge's car.

 As the tow truck takes the fused cars away, the insurance adjuster completes
 his interview.
   
   Agent: Now, before I give you the check, one more question.  This place
          ``Moe's'' you left just before the accident.  This is a business of
          some kind?
   Homer: [thinks]  Don't tell him you were at a bar!  Gasp!  But what else
          is open at night?
          [aloud] It's a pornography store.  I was buying pornography.
          [thinks]  Heh heh heh.  I would'a never thought of that.
   -- How not to throw an insurance agent off the scent, ``''
   
 Homer hitch-hikes to Crazy Vlaclav's Place of Automobiles and tries a
 sub-mini-compact.
   
   She'll go 300 hectares on a single tank of kerosene.
   -- Crazy Vlaclav tries to sell Homer a car, ``''
   
 Though Homer has trouble understanding the Cyrillic characters on the
 dashboard.  Next stop, the Springfield Auto Show.
   
   Kids!  If we buy a new car, we get our parking validated for free!
   -- Homer takes the kids to a car show, ``''
   
 Bart plays in the Bonnie and Clyde Death Car, and discovers money hidden
 in the glove compartment.  Lisa observes crash-test video by Fourth Reich
 Motors---and brings the demonstration to an early end when she points out
 the crash test dummies are real people.  Seated next to the Batmobile is...
   
   Homer: Gasp!  Adam West!  [calling] Kids!  Batman!
   Lisa:  Dad, that's not the real Batman.
   Adam West: Of &lt;course&gt; I'm the real Batman.  [shows a glossy]
          See, here's a picture of me with Robin.
   Bart:  Who the hell is Robin?
   -- Kids today, ``''
   
   Michelle Pfeiffer?  Ha!  The only true Catwoman is Julie Newmar, Lee
   Meriwether, or Eartha Kitt.
   -- Adam West muses, ``''
   
 The reminiscences continue, and Homer draws the kids away, very slowly.
 And bumps into a Kumatsu Motors snowplough.  Homer imagines what he could use
 it for...
   
   Homer, I've got to sneak these valuable artworks out of the White House,
   but I can't get out of my driveway because of these protesters!
   -- President George Bush moves out of the White House, ``''
   
 Homer imagines plowing through the crowd.  Back in reality, Homer realizes
 he can't afford to buy it, but the salesman tells him he could use the
 plow itself to make money by plowing driveways.
   
   Homer:    Well, I really should discuss this with my wife.
   Salesman: [scoffs] Your wife? [cracks an imaginary whip]
   Homer:    What, you think I'm going to buy a $20,000 truck just because you
             make that noise?
   Salesman: [does it again]  [and again]  [and again]
   Homer:    [on his knees]  I'll take it!
   -- ``''
   
 [End of Act One.  Time: 5:17]

 Marge learns of Homer's purchase.
   
   Marge: I can't believe you bought that plow.  We can't afford it!
   Homer: If you're going to get mad at me every time I do something stupid,
          then I guess I'll just have to stop doing stupid things!
   Marge: Good!
   Homer: Fine!  I'll never, ever, ever do another stupid thing.  Good night!
          [angrily turns to leave and walks face-first into the side of the truck]
   Marge: [concerned] Oh, Homey.  Didn't that hurt?
   Homer: [quietly]  No.
   -- I meant to do that, ``''
   
 Homer finishes placing advertising flyers on every car in the parking lot,
 only to have them blown away by a gust of wind.  He spots Barney dressed
 in nothing but a baby bonnet and diapers trying to hand out flyers for
 ``Lullabuy$'', a baby store.  He muses, ``Well, at least I can't sink any
 lower.''  His diaper blows away.  Barney runs naked down the street in
 pursuit.  Upon turning the corner, he says, ``Hi, Ma!''

 Homer approaches the altar to read from the epistles of Saint Paul, but
 instead takes the opportunity to advertise his snow-plow business.  But
 not for long.

 Lisa suggests bying cheap commercial time on channel 92, and points Homer
 at an advertisement for CDs of Captain McAlister singing sea shanties.
 Homer is impressed.

 Late at night, Homer settles on the couch with the family to watch the
 commercial---at 3:17 in the morning.
   
   It may be on a lousy channel, but The Simpsons are on TV!
   -- Homer proudly introduces his television debut, ``''
   
 Then proceeds a cheap commercial starring The Simpsons, selling, not
 candy bars or mini-vans, but Homer's snow-plow service.
   
   Homer: [narrating a TV commercial]
          Are you tired of having your hands cut off by snowblowers?
          And the inevitable heart attacks that come with shoveling snow?
   Bart+Lisa: Uh-huh!
   -- Homer's TV commercial as... ``''
   
   TV-Homer: Call now and receive a free T-shirt!
   Homer:    [watching at home, raises a ``Stockdale for VP'' T-shirt]
             He could still surprise ya!
   -- But can he hear ya?  ``''
   
   My prices are so low, you'll think I suffered brain damage!
   -- Truth in advertising, in Homer's TV commercial as... ``''
   
 Bart asks, ``You &lt;are&gt; fully bonded and licensed by the city, aren't
 you, ?''  Homer answers out of the corner of his mouth, ``Shut
 up, boy.''  The commercial concludes with an incredibly inane jingle.
 Followed by channel 92's test pattern.  Homer waits for the phone to
 ring, then decides ``Ah, the waiting game sucks.  Let's play
 Hungry-Hungry-Hippos!''

 Homer plows the Kwik-E-Mart parking lot, just in time for Snake and his
 pal to knock it over.  Homer plows the Springfield Retirement College
 driveway, and the residents express their pleasure that they are no
 longer trapped inside.  Then they return inside.  Principal Skinner
 considers cancelling school due to snow, but Homer plows the way for
 the school bus.  Bart suffers the slings and arrows and snowballs of
 ungrateful classmates.  On the steps of City Hall...
   
   , for making it possible for people to get where they're going
   without resorting to public transportation &lt;or&gt; car-pooling, I give you
   the key to the city.
   -- Diamond Joe Quimby, ``''
   
 Homer even earns a free beer from Moe in appreciation.  In response to
 Barney's musing, ``I wish I was a hero'', Homer tells him to ``get out
 there and be the best damned Barney you can be.''  Still clad in his
 bonnet and diapers, Barney rushes outside.  (And crashes into something.)

 At bedtime, Homer removes his robe, revealing that he is wearing the key
 around his neck.  Marge apologizes for being wrong about buying the truck,
 and asks Homer to wear the ``'' jacket to bed, ``Just for me.
 For fun.''  Homer does so, gets into bed, and turns off the light.

 At 7am, Homer wakes up to falling snow, but is shocked to find that all the
 driveways have already been plowed!  A giant snow-plow cruises down the
 street:  It's Barney ``Plow King'' Gumble.  To stimulate healthy competition,
 Barney produces a shotgun and takes out the tyres of Homer's truck.

 [End of Act Two.  Time: 14:52]

 At Moe's Tavern, the gang watch Barney's ``Plow King'' commercial, in which
 he bashes a cardboard cut-out of Homer with a baseball bat.  He is joined
 by Linda Ronstadt.
   
   Moe:    Linda Ronstadt!  How'd ya get &lt;her&gt;?
   Barney: Oh, we've been looking for a project to do together for a while.
   -- ``''
   
 Linda Ronstadt sings the ``Plow King'' theme song.  Homer is hurt.
 ``How could you, Barney?  After all I've done for you.''  Homer flashes
 back to his high school days.  A handsome Barney Gumble studies for his
 SAT's, with hopes of getting into Harvard.  Homer comes in and offers
 Barney a six-pack.  Barney is worried about tomorrow's test.
   
   I've got two words for you:  Mellow out, man.
   -- Homer Simpson, ``''
   
 Barney reluctantly takes a sip.  Then the entire can.  And gradually turns
 into the disgusting drunk we all know and l... we all know.

 Homer spots Ned and even Adam West letting Barney plow their driveways.
 Adam West hops into his Batmobile, snaps on his shoulder belt, and with
 some effort, manages to get his run-down Batmobile (complete with parachute
 brake) to putter down the street.

 Homer anxiously waits for the phone to ring.  And it does.  But it's the
 delinquent accounts department from Kumatsu Motors.
   
   Yeah, they were gay.
   -- Homer pretends to be Tony Plow, from ``Leave It to Beaver'', ``''
   
 Lisa suggests another commercial, and Homer offers to do a rap.
   
   I'm , and I'm here to say,
   I'm the velvetest guy in the USA.
   I got a big plow and I move a lot of things,
   Like your cow if ya had one...
   -- M. C. Homer, ``''
   
 The kids beg Homer never to rap again.

 Homer goes to the McMahon and Tate Advertising Agency for help.

 The family watch the results.  It's one of those weird almost-black-and-white
 ``artistic'' commercials that make no sense.

 Diamond Joe Quimby forcibly removes the key to the city from Homer's hands
 in an attempt to give it to Barney.

 Springfield is in the midst of a blizzard.
   
   Kent:  Hardest hit by the blizzard is Springfield's forbidding Widow's Peak.
          Our own Arnie Pie is on the scene.
   Arnie: [live remote, in a helicopter]  Everything's snowed in!  All I can see
          is white!
   Kent:  [impatiently]  Arnie, please.  The ski conditions.
   Arnie: [now upside-down]  Mayday!  Mayday!  I think I'm flying into a mountain!
          Tell my wife I lo... [picture fuzzes out]
   Kent:  [chuckles] That's great, Arnie.
   -- Weather report, ``''
   
 Homer gets an idea.  He calls Barney with a disguised voice asking him to
 plow his driveway atop Widow's Peak.  Barney is in a hot-tub with Linda
 Ronstadt.
   
   Homer:   [on the phone, disguising his voice]
            There's a $10,000 bill in it for you.
   Barney:  Oh yeah?  Which president's on it?
   Homer:   Uh... All of them.  They're having a party.  Jimmy Carter's
            passed out on the couch.
   Barney:  Wow!
   -- Don't ask where Jack Kennedy is, ``''
   
 Linda Ronstadt offers to make a Spanish version of the  theme.

 Homer steals all of Barney's customers.
   
   Woman: Could you make sure not to scrape my asphalt?
   Homer: [sotto voce]  Kiss &lt;my&gt; asphalt.
   -- ``''
   
 News flash:  Barney was caught in an avalanche at Widow's Peak.  The
 shocking event was captured on film by a FOX camera crew filming ``In
 Search of Bigfoot.''  The scene of Bigfoot is ruined when the guy in
 the ape suit forgets to take off his watch before shooting begins.
 Off to the side is Barney studying a map.  He belches, and the sound
 induces the avalanche, burying him.  Homer assumes full responsibility
 and heads out to save his buddy.

 At the foot of the mountain, Marge makes one last plea for Homer not to
 go.  Homer assures her, ``This baby is as sure-footed as a mountain goat.''
 In true sitcom fashion, a faraway mountain goat loses its footing and
 descends the mountain the painful way.

 To cross a dangerous chasm, Homer braves a dilapidated rope bridge.
 Not until he's halfway across does he notice the sturdy modern bridge
 that runs next to it.

 Making its way along a precarious ledge, the truck loses its traction
 and teeters ever-so-precariously over the edge.  Homer carefully turns
 the radio dial towards the upper end of the dial, and this proves enough
 to tip the truck back to safety.

 Barney has resigned himself to his fate, but Homer arrives and rescues
 him.  The two are reconciled and agree to become partners.  Homer is
 pleased.  ``When two best friends work together, not even God Himself
 can stop them.''  A stern voice challenges, ``Oh no?''  The sun suddenly
 appears, melting the snow.  All of it.
   
   Could this record-breaking heat wave be the result of the dreaded
   ``Greenhouse Effect''?  Well, if 70-degree days in the middle of winter
   are the `price' of car pollution, you'll forgive me if I keep my old Pontiac.
   -- Kent Brockman's Two Cents, ``''
   
 Homer answers the phone:  It's the Repo Depot, calling to distract him
 while they re-possess his truck.  Which they do.  Marge looks on the
 bright side.  ``You have your health, you have your best friend back,
 and... [coyly] you do have that certain special something...''  She
 means, of course, the  jacket.  Homer fetches the jacket from
 the closet and makes his own weather prediction:  ``The forecast calls
 for flurries of passion, followed by extended periods of gettin' it on.''

 Animation and continuity goofs


When the school bus approaches, the sidewalk is covered in snow, marred only
by Martin's footprints.  When Bart gets off, the sidewalk has been shoveled.
But when Bart falls face-first onto the walk, his fall is conveniently
broken by a layer of snow.

When Homer goes to bed, he is wearing just the  jacket and undershorts.
But when he wakes up the next morning, he is also wearing jeans.  Maybe he
went back and put on some clothes afterwards.

 Comments and other observations


 For non-American viewers...


Television channels fall into two groups.  VHF (Very High Frequency)
channels are numbered from 2 through 13, and UHF (Ultra-High
Frequency) channels run from 14 through 83.  VHF frequencies are
highly-prized, and as a result, they belong to well-financed stations.
(The FCC reserves a VHF frequency in each metropolitan area for public
television.)  UHF stations are smaller and, as Homer learned, sell
advertising time at a much cheaper rate.

 References obvious and obscure


 Carnival of the Stars


A spoof of ``Circus of the Stars'', an annual showcase for American television
stars to risk their lives for no good reason.

 The Inspector General


Ron Drake (Jawara@Applelink.Apple.COM) identifies the music for ``Crazy
Vaclav's'' as the ``Yakov's Elixir'' theme from ``The Inspector General''
starring Danny Kaye.

 Roto-Rooter


Homer stole the music for his ``'' jingle from the American plumbing
company ``Roto-Rooter''.  His lyrics are much stupider.
The original lyrics are ``Call Roto-Rooter, that's the name, and away goes
trouble down the drain.''

 McMahon and Tate


The esteemed David Tamkin@{dwt} informs those of us innocent of the USA's
sitcom heritage that ``McMann and Tate was the advertising agency that
employed Darrin Stephens in `Bewitched'.  For some reason, the ad agency
was named McMahon &amp; Tate instead, using Ed and Jim's spelling.

``I don't think McMann of `Bewitched' ever had a first name given: he was
never seen on camera nor spoken about much, and there was no indication I
remember whether he was retired, deceased, or still active.  All executive
decisions there rested in the hands of Larry Tate (played by the late David
White).''

 Walter Cronkite


Bob Hogue@{bh2} points out that the scene in which Kent Brockman reports
the avalanche ``was a nearly-exact copy of the on-the-air tape of Walter
Cronkite as he delivered the bulletin officially confirming JFK's
assassination, right down to him removing his black-rimmed
glasses and staring into the camera to bring the news.  The
background scene in the newsroom was also identical.  It was a
rather unnerving ref.''

Leff Jind @{jl} adds that Kent looks down to his right (the wire?)
pauses a moment (Cronkite later said he was holding back tears) and
then pulls off his glasses and gives the news report.


 Taxi


Barney's fate is similar to that of Jim (Christopher Lloyd) on ``Taxi''.
Jim was at Harvard and reluctantly smoked pot on the principle of ``If I do
it, maybe you'll go away.''  Howard Goldstein@{hlg} points out that the
similarity is hardly coincidental: James L. Brooks wrote that episode of
``Taxi''.

 Non-references


The snowball attack has been claimed by various people to be references to
``The Godfather'', ``Bonny and Clyde'', and the Los Angeles Riots of 1992.

Nobody wins the rickety bridge reference award unless the movie they propose
also has the same music as the one used in the scene.

 Name-dropping


Greg Hilton@{gh2} points out that this episode had an unusual amount of
name-dropping.  He lists Angela Lansbury, Alan Thicke, Ricardo Montalban,
Adam West, Michelle Pfeiffer, Julie Newmar, Lee Meriweather, Eartha Kitt,
George Bush, Admiral Stockdale, and Linda Ronstadt.  (Don't forget Jimmy
Smits.)

 Young Homer's room


Robert Yantosca @{ry} spotted a poster of Pink Floyd's ``Dark Side of
the Moon'' album on the wall.  This is particularly interesting
because one of the songs on the album is titled ``Brain Damage''.
Oddly appropriate for Homer's room.

 Linda Ronstadt's song


Felix Madera@{fm} translates ``Se\~nor Plow no es macho, es solamente un
borracho'' as `` isn't macho, he's just a drunk.''

 Lost animation


The trailers for the episode showed an overhead view of Homer in his plow,
spelling out the ``The Simpsons'' logo in the snow, making a curl at the
end of the last `s', running into a tree, and yelling ``D'oh!'' @{krn}

 Miscellaneous


Daniel A. Murphy@{dam} cites a San Francisco newspaper as having
reported that the George Bush scene was inserted after the outcome of
the 1992 presidential election.  A different scene had been prepared
in the event that Bush won re-election.

In response to speculation as to the reason for the scene, Bucky
Whaley@{bw} probably correctly interprets it as follows: ``It's just
an illustration of the way Homer's mind works.  We know Homer pilfers
pretty much anything he can get his hands on from work [from episode
7F13].  He probably assumes everyone else does the same.  So in his
fantasy, he heroically clears a path through the protestors for George
Bush, who---like any other regular guy---would snatch whatever's lying
around from a job he's about to leave.''


It might be noted that Saturday Night Live had a sketch about the
outgoing president with a similar theme, except that Bush was merely
swiping office supplies rather than priceless art.


Lisa Sheehan (lsheehan@hamp.hampshire.edu) believes she saw Elvis when
Homer was flipping through a wad of bills.  Alas, she was merely
hallucinating; all the bills said ``Five''.  (But I swear I saw Elvis
on a stamp!)


I thought Barney's Ma was in Norway.


I hope everybody got the joke about ``Widow's Peak''.

If anybody says that the rope bridge scene was a reference to an Indiana Jones
movie, I'll scream.

A hectare is a unit of area, not length.

Kumatsu Motors was the company that took over Herb Powell's car company.

 EPISODE TITLE: Lisa's First Word


EPISODE SUMMARY:  (with help from Raymond Chen and Ricardo Lafaurie)
[Syndication cuts are marked in curly braces "{}" and are courtesy of
Frederic Briere.]

The family are trying to get Maggie to speak.

 Marge: [Holding bottle] Maggie, can you say ba-ba?  Can you say mama?
  Bart: Can you say get bent?
 Marge: Bart!
  Bart: Mister Rogers says it all the time!
 Marge: He does not.
 Homer: Maggie, can you say daddy?  Daddy?
 Marge: Kitty.  Kitty.
  Lisa: Be-bop.  Be-bop.
  Bart: Shove it.  Shove it.
Maggie: [burp]
 Homer: Did you hear that?  She said "burlap"!
-- Too much chicken for Liz, 

        Marge: Oh Maggie, when are you going to talk?
         Lisa: Well, don't push her.  Remember, it is better to remain
               silent and be thought a fool than open your mouth and
               remove all doubt.
Homer's brain: What does that mean?  Better say something or they'll
               think you're stupid.
        Homer: Takes one to know one.
Homer's brain: Swish!
-- Homer, non sequitur master, 

Marge: According to Fretful Mother Magazine, if Maggie doesn't talk at
       age one, we should consider a corrective tongue extender.
-- And then she can be the world's youngest Gene Simmons, "Lisa's First
    Word"

Bart wants to know what his first word was.  We flash back to Bart
coming into the parents' bedroom at the wrong time and baby Bart
exclaiming, "Ay, caramba!"  In the present, Marge finishes lamely, "I
don't remember..."

    Marge: The story of  is very cute.
Bart+Lisa: Tell it, Mom!  Tell it, Mom!  Tell it!
    Homer: Yeah.  Tell it, Mom!
-- Homer, caught up in the moment, 

Marge begins, "This story begins in the unforgettable spring of 1983.
Ms.  Pacman struck a blow for women's rights and a young Joe Piscopo
taught us how to laugh."  Flashback to the turbulent 80's in East
Springfield.  We see some boys go to play stick ball -- the video game.
Marge and Bart are waiting for Homer to come home from work.  Marge
chats about M*A*S*H with the neighbors.  (Homer, Marge and Bart live in
an apartment.)

Enter Homer, singing Cyndi Lauper's "Girls Just Want To Have Fun".

 Bart: Homer!
Homer: Heh, heh, heh, heh, heh.  Homer's what grownups call me.  Call me
       daddy.
 Bart: Homer.
Homer: Daddy.
 Bart: Homer.
Homer: [increasingly irate] Daddy.
 Bart: Da...da...da...
Homer: Yes?
 Bart: D'omer!  Hah, hah, hah...
Homer: Why you little...[chokes Bart]
-- Homer practices tongue extension on Bart, 

A montage follows.  Bart leaps on a sleeping Homer.  They eat spaghetti
together.  Bart horrifies the parents by hanging (naked) from a
clothesline over a 40-feet drop to the street.  He swings around and
around, enjoying himself immensely -- so much so that he continues
swinging for many hours, well into the evening, as the parents watch
from the window.

Marge tells young Bart a bedtime story.

Marge: Then the prince and the princess...[yawn] got married and lived
       happily ever after.
 Bart: Then what happened?
Marge: Uh...they had thirty sons and thirty daughters.
 Bart: What were their names?
Marge: Hmm...Dennis...Brad...Mavis...Brad...[asleep]
-- They must have been Catholic, 

Bart decides to flip on Johnny Carson; he laughs and imitates Ed McMahon
well: "Hi-oo!"

The next day, Homer plays with his son.

Homer: Got your nose!  Heh heh heh.
 Bart: Got your wallet!  [flushes down toilet]
-- Precocious, ain't he, 

Homer then orders him never to do that again, but Bart just beeps
Homer's nose.  Enter Marge.

Marge: There's going to be twice as much love in this house as there is
       now!
Homer: We're going to start doing it in the morning?!
-- Slow on the uptake, 

Bzzzt.  She's awaiting another baby.  Homer's keys are flushed down the
but Marge doesn't seem to care.  "Hear that, Bart?  You're going to have
a little brother or sister to play with!"  Bart imagines the
possibilities.

Marge is becoming as big as a house, so they talk about their future.

Marge: I'm afraid we're going to need a bigger house.
Homer: No, we won't.  I've got it all figured out.  The baby can have
       Bart's crib and Bart'll sleep with us until he's 21.
Marge: Won't that warp him?
Homer: My cousin Frank did it.
Marge: You don't have a cousin Frank.
Homer: He became Francine back in '76.  Then he joined that cult.  I
       think her name is Mother Shabubu now.
-- Recipe for a pervert, 

Marge continues, "That afternoon, we left Bart with my sisters and went
house-hunting."  The Gruesome Twosome are entertained by Bart's medley
singing of "I'm a Little Teapot" and "Itsy-Bitsy Spider".  "Love that
`Spout' medley," one of them sighs.

Homer and Marge visit Stinking Fish Realty.  But they have problems
finding a proper house -- or the proper neighborhood.  The first one is
too violent.  The second house is located next to a rendering plant.
("Mmm...hog fat").  {The third one is Captain McAllister's houseboat,
where the good Captain's sales pitch is interrupted while he wrestles a
Great White.}  And the fourth is full of cats.

Marge: Once we get the cats out of the way, it won't be too bad
Agent: Actually, according to the will, the cats own the house.  You'd
       be their tenants!
-- 

Lisa: I wish we lived in the kitty house.
Bart: I could've trained them to be my unholy army of the night.  Go, my
      pretties!  Kill!  Kill!
-- The Wicked Bart of the West, 

"We were about to give up, but then we found the house that was
perfect"...on Evergreen Terrace.  In Homer's mind's eye, he visualizes
adding a TV and couch to the living room and grins.  But he needs to be
able to afford the place first, so he heads off to see his father.

Homer: Dad, I have a problem.
  Abe: Why did you come to me?  I don't know nothin'.  I used to get by
       on my looks.  Now they're gone...withered away like an old piece
       of fruit...[cries]
Homer: Are you done?
-- Homer, sympathy king, 

Not yet, Abe's not.  He continues until Homer interrupts him.

 Homer: I need $15,000 to buy a home.
Grampa: Oh, well.  All I own is this house that I built with my own two
        hands.
 Homer: You didn't build this house.  You won it on a crooked 50's game
        show.
Grampa: I ratted on everybody and got off scott free!  Hah-hah!  [They
        exchange high-fives]
-- The $15,000 Question, 

Grampa: All right, son, I'll sell this dump and write you a check.
 Homer: Dad, first you gave me life, now you've given me a home for my
        family, I'd be honored if you came to live with us.
Grampa: Thank you!
  Bart: [in the present] So how long before you shipped Grampa off to
        the old-folks home?
 Homer: About three weeks.
         [everyone laughs]
-- 

[End of Act One.  Time: 8:14]

Homer tries to bargain with Maggie: a cookie for a word.  Maggie
distracts him and grabs the cookie.  "D'oh!  Okay, you win round 7."

 Lisa: When do we get to my first word?
Homer: Your what what?
 Lisa: [indignant] My first words!
Homer: Nah, you don't want to hear that story.  I know.  I'll tell you
       about the time I got locked in the bank vault with Mr. Mooney.
       It was another one of my harebrained schemes.
 Lisa: Dad!
Homer: Wait a minute.  That was the Lucy show.
-- TV that gives so much, 

Homer presumes Lisa isn't interested in stuff like that and begins to
tell a story how he was locked in the bank vault with Mr. Mooney, then
realizes he's confused real life with Lucy Show.

Homer: Okay, where were we?
 Bart: Mom was preggers and Dad threw all our money down a sink hole.
Homer: Ah yes.
-- Homer narrates the story of Bart's childhood, 

"I remember the day we moved in."  Homer has trouble with carrying Marge
over the threshold, then with Bart, who is not pleased with their new
home.  Bart gets strangled after another Daddy vs. Homer argument.  Just
then, at the door, Ned and Todd Flanders arrive to welcome their new
neighbors, singing.  "We welcome you to the neighborhood, sing fa-la-la-
la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la..."

  Ned: Buenos Dias, neighboritos!  The handle is Flanders, but my
       friends call me Ned.
Homer: [sullen] Hi, Flanders.
-- Setting the tone for years to come, 

Todd hugs Bart enthusiastically, asking him for friendship, and when
Bart pushes him off, Todd giggles, "You're funny."

  Ned: If you need anything just give a whistle.
Homer: I could use a TV tray.
  Ned: Well, gee...
Homer: What?
  Ned: Uh, I just this minute bought it at the hardware...
Homer: You said "anything".
  Ned: Heh, sure, you can borrow it for...a little while.
Homer: [in the present] And that little while is now eight years and
       counting.  Heh, heh, heh.
-- 

Bart has entered the terrible two's.  He bangs a spoon on a pan while
wearing a pot on his head.

 Bart: I am so great!  I am so great!  Everybody loves me, I am so
       great!
Marge: Honey, honey, honey, honey, honey.  Could you please be quiet?
 Bart: Quiet!  Quiet!  Quiet!  Quiet!  Quiet!  Quie --
Marge: Bart, get out!
-- Those terrible two's, 

Bart goes to watch an Itchy &amp; Scratchy cartoon ("100 Yard Gash") with
Homer.

Homer: It's not easy to juggle a pregnant wife and a troubled child, but
       somehow I managed to fit in eight hours of TV a day.
-- Back when Homer wasn't in a bind, 

Scratchy lines up for the Olympic sprint, but Itchy nails his tail to
the ground.  Scratchy runs out of his skin and wins the race.  After
I&amp;S, Krusty appears, promoting his Official Meat-Flavored Sandwich of
the 1984 Olympics.  He also pulls a prank on Sideshow Bob.

 Bart: Krusty funny!
Homer: Duh.
-- Homer watches TV with Little Bart, 

Krusty continues his promotion -- just scrape off the name of the event
from your game card that comes with the sandwich and if America wins a
gold medal, you win a free burger!  -- then takes a bite of a sandwich.
"Mmm!"  End of commercial.

    Krusty: Blech!  [spits the burger out] Oh, I almost swallowed some
            of the juice.
             [drinks from his flask] Uhh, I'll be tasting that for
            weeks.
Accountant: Great spot, K. C.
    Krusty: Put a sock in it, preppy.  How much are these free burgers
            gonna cost me?
Accountant: Not to worry, Mr. K. We've rigged the cards: they're all in
            events that Communists never lose.
    Krusty: I like, I like.
     Woman: This just came over the wires, Big K.
    Krusty: [reads] Uh-huh.  Soviet boycott.  U.S. unopposed in most
            events.  How does this affect our giveaway?
Accountant: Let's see.  [calculates] You personally stand to lose $44
            million.
-- As long as he never bets against the Globetrotters, "Lisa's First
    Word"

Bart refuses to give up his crib to the new baby, even after much
pulling and reverse psychology from Homer, so Homer builds him a new bed
-- a clown bed.  "Homer J. Simpson, you're a genius."  Only the clown is
grotesque and frightening looking.  Homer reassures Bart he'll be able
to laugh himself to sleep, but Bart imagines the clown intoning with
barely-suppressed evil glee, "If you should die before you wake..."

Bart: Can't sleep, clown'll eat me...Can't sleep, clown'll eat me...
-- Bart laughs himself to sleep, 

The family watch the Olympics.

Announcer: And we're seconds away from the 100-meter butterfly.  While
           the East German, heh heh, "women", are shaving their backs
           three thousand miles away, the Americans are heavy favorites.
-- The 1984 Olympics butterfly competition, 

Homer's stomach grumbles.  "Patience, my pet."  The butterfly begins,
but half of the contestants are about to drown because they come from
countries that don't have swimming pools.  The other announcer comments
sarcastically, "Boo hoo, you're breaking my heart!"

Marge: Homer, I think the baby is coming.
Homer: Wow.  A baby and a free burger.  Could this be the best day of my
       life?
   TV: Next up, an hour-long episode of "Mama's Family".
Homer: Yess!
-- The day he skips church is eight years away, 

Ned, Todd and Rod are with Bart saying bye to Homer and Marge, who leave
for the hospital.

     Ned: We'll take good care of your boy, Simpson.  Enjoy the miracle
          of creation!
   Homer: Shut up, Flanders.  [drives off]
     Ned: So, what d'you kids wanna play?
Rod+Todd: "Good Samaritan!"
-- Gotta start 'em young, 

At the Flanders' home...

Todd: I get to clothe the leper.
 Rod: Lucky!
 Ned: Supper time, boys!
Todd: Oh boy: liver!
 Rod: Iron helps us play.
-- "Good Samaritan" and dinner at the Flanderses, 

Bart says he wants back home, but changes his mind after seeing his
scary bed through the window.

Bed-time.  Todd and Rod sing religious songs ("I've got some joy, joy,
joy, joy down in my heart.  (Where?)  Down in my heart to stay!  And if
the devil doesn't like it, he can sit on a tack.  (Ouch!)  Sit on a
tack.  (Ouch!)"), so Bart decides to sneak away.  On the way, he happens
to run into a very old Grandma Flanders, who scares him.  ("Hello, Joe!
Can you help me with my psalms?")

After Lisa's birth, Homer gives Lisa the good news: he's already started
her college fund at Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan.  Marge reads Fretful Mother
Magazine.

Marge: According to this magazine, Bart might be jealous of her [Lisa].
Homer: Well, Bart can kiss my hairy yellow butt.
-- Mmm...hairy yellow, 

Back at home, Bart is puzzled.  He imagines talking heads flying around
him ("From now on the baby sleeps in the crib", "Iron helps us play",
Evil Clown laughter, and "Hello, Joe!").  Homer interrupts Bart's
hallucinations by asking him to come and see Little Lisa.  Marge sits in
a rocking chair, holding Lisa, with light streaming through the
curtains.  Lisa wakes up, yawning.  The scene is adorable.  "Well, Bart,
what do you think of Little Lisa?"  Marge asks expectantly.  "I hate
you," spits Bart.

[End of Act Two.  Time: 15:33]

Marge: I saved this newspaper from the day Lisa was born.
 Lisa: "Mondale to Hart: [confused] Where's the beef?"
 Bart: "Where's the beef?"  What the hell that's supposed to mean?
Homer: Heh heh heh heh heh.  "Where's the beef"...No wonder he won
       Minnesota.
-- Homer, savvy politico, 

Marge continues her story.  "Everyone agreed that Lisa was a beautiful
baby."  Back to the flashbacks.  Patty and Selma, smoking, have come to
see Lisa.

Patty: Isn't that cute.  She's coughing.
-- Wait 'til she spits up, 

Selma gives Lisa a kiss -- a close-up of her face makes most of us puke.
Bart tries to gain attention by singing Allouette, but isn't noted.
"You still here?"

Patty: The older they get, the cuter they ain't.
-- The universal truth as told by a Bouvier spinster, "Lisa's First
    Word"

The Gruesome Twosome concentrate on Lisa.  "Hey, the baby just spit up!"
notes Selma cheerfully.

Homer follows the last day of the 24th Olympiad, brought to you by
Krusty Burger _tm_.  Krusty appears, smoking and crying.  "You people
are pigs!  I, personally, am going to spit in every fiftieth burger!"
Homer doesn't worry.  "I like those odds."

An announcer comes onscreen.

Announcer: In a moment, we'll look at the courageous Korean gymnast, Kim
           Huyang, who made a perfect dismount and which was later
           revealed to be...a broken leg!
   Huyang: Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrrgggggggggghh!
Announcer: [cheerfully] Ho ho ho ho hoo.  Ouch!
-- Watching sports, 

Homer watches boxing, in which Drederick Tatum has beaten a "supine
Swede" (says Howard Cosell).  Homer dances around the room like Tatum
when he realizes he has won a burger.

{At a Krusty Burger, Homer, Wiggum and many others are receiving their
free burgers.  "Carl Lewis, I could kiss you" comments Wiggum.}  Homer
chants "USA!  USA!  USA!" and the crowds join in with him.

Hibbert performs a little eye test on Lisa, who has a perfect vision.

Hibbert: Heh, heh, heh, heh, heh.  She has the relexes of a young Mary
         Lou Retton.  Have a wowwipop.  [gives Lisa one]
   Bart: Can _I_ have a lollipop?
Hibbert: Oh Bart, I'm afraid that was the last one.  But I've got
         something even better for you: a rubella innoculation!
          [holds up a giant needle]
-- Ten-braided Hibbert and his medicine, 

Bart rubs his arm back at the house.

 Bart: I wanna hold the baby.  I wanna hold the baby.
Marge: I'm sorry, Bart, you're too little.
Homer: Here, Bart, you can hold my beer.
-- 

Lisa is put to bed.  Bart, who has sneaked into the room, brandishes
some scissors.  Some time later, Marge comes in.  "Lisa, it's time for
your feeding...aah!"  Bart has cut all of Lisa's hair off -- only
stubble remains.  "Who's cuter now?"  Bart is sent to the corner.

When Lisa's hair has grown back, Bart sticks stamps on Lisa and puts her
in the mail box.  Later, he's back in the corner because the "Stupid
mailman squealed on me..."

Ned Flanders pays a visit, returning Lisa that Bart had stuck through
the Flanders' doggy door.  Ned's attempt to get back his TV tray fails.
Homer orders Bart over to the corner, but then realizes he's already
there.

Bart prepares to run away from home.  Lisa is puzzled.  Bart explains
that it was still fun when it was just Homer, Marge and him.

Bart: You wrecked everything.  I'm leaving.  Goodbye.
Lisa: Bart.
Bart: [amazed] What did you say?  Say it again!
Lisa: Bart.
Bart: Sufferin' Succotash!  You can talk!
Lisa: Goo.
-- , 

Bart takes her downstairs to Homer and Marge.  Lisa demonstrates her
newfound skill.  "Bart Bart Bart Bart Bart Bart."  "I was her first
word!"  Lisa can also say "Mommy", so Bart tries to get her to say the
name of the actor on the "Knight Rider" cover of TV guide.

Bart: Can you say David Hasselhoff?
Lisa: Davah Hassa-hoff.
-- Lisa learns to talk, 

Homer: Can you say Daddy?
 Lisa: Homer.
Homer: No, sweetie.  Daddy.
 Lisa: [pause] Homer.
Homer: D'oh!
-- Like son, like daughter?, 

Bart and Lisa laugh, and hug.  Back to the present.

 Bart: I was sitting there!
 Lisa: I don't see your name on it!
 Bart: It's right there!
Marge: Bart, don't write on the rug.
-- Lisa wasn't looking hard enough, 

Homer takes Maggie and heads upstairs.

 Homer: The sooner kids talk, the sooner they talk back.
         [tucks Maggie in] I hope you never say a word.
         [shuts the door]
Maggie: [taking her pacifier out] Daddy.
-- Maggie's first word, 

...and then she falls asleep.

"COPS in Springfield!"

Bad cops, bad cops...Bad cops, bad cops Springfield cops are on the take
But what do you expect for the money we make?  Whether in a car or on a
horse We don't mind using excessive force Bad cops, bad cops...Bad cops,
bad cops
-- Theme music for "Cops in Springfield", 

Chief Wiggum and his men try to catch a cattle rustler by using a
battering ram on a house, and it's Reverend Lovejoy's house.

Lovejoy: What in God's name is going on here?
 Wiggum: Isn't this 742 Evergreen Terrace?
Lovejoy: No, that's next door.
          [next door, Snake drives out of a garage]
  Snake: Close but no doughnut, cops.
          [drives off]
-- Snake, cattle rustler, 

Wiggum: This is Papa Bear.  Put out an APB for a male suspect, driving
        a...car of some sort, heading in the direction of...you know,
        that place that sells chili.  Suspect is hatless.  Repeat,
        hatless.
-- Snake makes his escape, 

Homer: I can't wait 'till they throw his hatless butt in jail.
Marge: Homer, you shouldn't eat so much food.  It's bad for your heart.
Homer: Oh, my heart is just fi-- aagh!  [gags]
Marge: Homey, what's wrong?
Homer: [strained] Just-- working-- the turkey through...[pause]
        [normal] There it goes.
-- A little beer will put out that fire, 

Bart and Lisa eat breakfast.

Bart: Hey, Lis, I heard that there was a train wreck last night.  Wanna
      see the victims?
Lisa: Sure.
       [Bart opens his mouth, showing "see-food"]
      Bart, that's gross!
Bart: You're right.  Let's bury them at sea.
       [scoops his goop into Lisa's cereal]
-- Bart and Lisa eat breakfast, 

Lisa yells for Dad, and Homer gets another relapse.  Sweating, he
struggles.

 Bart: What's wrong, Dad?
Homer: [strained] You know that feeling you get when a thousand knives
       of fire are stabbing you in the heart?  I'm having that right
       now...[normal] Ooh, bacon!
-- Bacon will put out that fire too, 

Marge: Homer, I've made a special surprise just for you!
Homer: It can only be one thing.
        [imagines a roast pig suggesting Homer eat his rump]
Marge: [hands Homer oatmeal] Here you go.
Homer: What the hell is this?
Marge: Nice, healthy oatmeal.
Homer: [sarcastic] Ooh, oatmeal, what a delightful treat!  Aw, there's a
       bug in it.
        [dumps the oatmeal in the sink]
Marge: No there isn't.
Homer: Trust me.
        [starts eating bacon]
 Bart: Dad, there's a bug on that.
Homer: Naah.
        [keeps on eating]
-- Selective vision, 

Homer drives to work, behind Hans Moleman, carting Edgar Allan Poe's
birthplace in a truck.  Homer tries to get him to move by bashing his
house in when he hears his heart beat irregularly.  He drives away while
Hans' truck falls off the hill and bursts into flames.

           
            [at the gas station]
    Homer: I keep hearing this horrible irregular thumping noise.
Attendant: It's your heart.  And I think it's on it's last thump.
    Homer: Oh, I thought it was my transmission.  [drives away happily]
      Kid: Where's he going?
Attendant: You remember that old Plymouth we just couldn't fix?
      Kid: We're going to sell him to Mr. Nikopopolous?!
Attendant: You're a dull boy, Billy.
-- Missing the point, 

   Burns: Look at that pig.  Stuffing his face with donuts on my time!
          That's right, keep eating...Little do you know you're drawing
          ever closer to the poison donut!
           [cackles evilly, then stops abruptly]
          There is a poison one, isn't there Smithers?
Smithers: Err...no, sir.  I discussed this with our lawyers and they
          consider it murder.
-- Damn their oily hides, 

Burns calls Homer in to give him a dressing-down.

       
        [a "window" shows Homer's heart, beating fast]
Burns: Relax, Simpson.  I just brought you in here for a friendly
       hello...
Homer: Whew...[heart slows down]
Burns: ...and goodbye!  You're fired!
Homer: [gags] [heart speeds up]
Burns: But, wait.  Perhaps I'm being too hasty.  You _are_ highly
       skilled...
Homer: Whew...[heart slows down]
Burns: ...at goofing off!
Homer: Aaargh!  [heart beats faster]
Burns: Now don't worry, Homer.  You're the kind of guy I could really
       dig...
Homer: Whew...[heart slows down]
Burns: ...a grave for!
Homer: Aaargh!  [heart beats faster than anything]
Burns: Your indolence is inefficacious!
Homer: [stares blankly] [heart beats normally]
Burns: That means, you're terrible!
Homer: Aarrggghh!  [heart goes crazy] [collapses]
-- The straw that broke the heart's back, 

                     [Homer's astral body rises from Homer's physical
                     body]
           Smithers: [examines Homer's dead body]
                     Mr. Burns, I think he's dead.
              Burns: Oh dear.  Send a ham to his widow.
Homer's astral body: Mmm...ham...[returns to Homer's body]
           Smithers: No, wait.  He's alive.
              Burns: Oh good.  Cancel the ham.
              Homer: D'oh!
-- Gypped out of the ham of consolation, 

Patty, Selma, and Marge are clipping coupons.

Buy three tubes of Mister Blister, get one free.
-- Patty reads a discount coupon, 

Marge: [answers the phone]
       Hello...Yes?  Oh my Lord!
       Homer's in the hospital, they think it's his heart!  [leaves]
Patty: Oh my God.
Selma: What?
Patty: Five cents off wax paper.
Selma: [slaps her cheek in amazement]
-- I can't believe they reduced it, 

Marge rushes to the hospital, {passing several patients}.  Hibbert uses
a fribillator to revive Homer, and Homer seems to like it.  Homer says
his whole life flashed before his eyes; first, Abe admires little Homer,
until he finds out young Homer is sucking on a pizza.  Next, Homer sings
in the choir, and Abe predicts making a fortune out of him...until his
voice changes.  "Dagnab it!"

I'm out of the woods now, right?  I mean, whatever doesn't kill me can
only make me stronger!
-- Homer recovers from a heart attack, 

Remember your Hippopotamus oath!
-- Homer to Dr. Hibbert, 

  Marge: Can't you do something for him?
Hibbert: Well, we can't fix his heart, but we can tell you exactly how
         damaged it is.
  Homer: What an age we live in!
-- Modern technology, 

         [Homer stands behind an X-ray machine]
Hibbert: Now what you see here is the radioactive dye flowing through
         your husband's circulatory system.
  Nurse: But Doctor, I haven't injected the dye yet!
Hibbert: Good Lord!
-- Real lead in the radiation shields, my butt, 

Homer is in his underwear.

Hibbert: Now I'm going to do a fat analysis test.  I'll start your
         jiggling and measure how long it takes to stop.
          [starts it jiggling]
          [jiggles for five seconds]
  Homer: Woo hoo!  Look at that blubber fly!
Hibbert: Yes.  [to intercom] Nurse, cancel my 1:00.
-- Homer takes a fat analysis test, 

Hibbert: Homer, I'm afraid you'll have to undergo a coronary bypass
         operation.
  Homer: Say it in English, Doc.
Hibbert: You're going to need open heart surgery.
  Homer: Spare me your medical mumbo-jumbo.
Hibbert: We're going to cut you open and tinker with your ticker.
  Homer: Could you dumb it down a shade?
-- 

  Marge: Doctor, we'll do whatever it takes to get my Homey well.
Hibbert: Good.  I must warn you though, this procedure will cost you
         upwards to $30,000.
  Homer: Aaarrrggh!  [collapses]
Hibbert: I'm afraid it's now $40,000.
-- Escalating medical costs, 

{Wiggum buys something at the Kwik-E-Mart and ignores his police radio
which tells him there's a robbery in progress.  "Bad Cops" plays
again...}

[End of Act One.  Time: 7:59]

Marge and Homer talk in bed.

Marge: Don't you have a health plan at work?
Homer: We used to, but we gave it up for a pinball machine in the
       lounge.
Marge: D'oh!
-- Heart attack?  Not while I'm playing Pinbot, 

Homer: Don't worry, Marge.  America's health care system is second only
       to Japan, Canada, Sweden, Great Britain, well, all of Europe, but
       you can thank your lucky stars we don't live in Paraguay!
-- But you _can_ get eyelash implants legally there, "Homer's Triple
    Bypass"

Homer goes to Happy Widow's Insurance.

Clerk: Now before we give you health insurance, I have to ask you a few
       questions.
Homer: Questions!  Questions!  My whole scheme down the -- [realizes] I
       mean ask away.
Clerk: Now, under "heart attacks", you crossed out three and wrote zero.
Homer: Oh, I thought that said "brain hemorrhages".
Clerk: All right.  Here's your policy.
Homer: Now let me tell _you_ something, Mr. Sucker.  I just--
Clerk: Wait, you haven't signed it yet.
Homer: [takes pen] Oh, yeah, I-- [gags] ...must...sign...policy!
Clerk: [pulling policy] I'm sorry, sir, we can't insure you!
Homer: I made an H!
Clerk: That doesn't count!
Homer: Looks like an X.
        [the clerk manages to pull it away]
Clerk: We better get you to a hospital.
Homer: Can I have a free calendar?
Clerk: OK.
-- Homer's attempt to get health insurance, 

At the hospital, Homer is revived by the fribillator once again.

Oh Doctor, I was in a wonderful place filled with fire and brimstone and
there were all guys in red pyjamas sticking pitchforks in my butt!
-- Homer recovers from a heart attack, 

Hibbert: Mr. Simpson, you must get that operation as soon as possible.
  Homer: But I don't have $40,000!  Maybe I'll just get one of these
         machines.  [the fribillator]
          [buzzes himself once more] Oh, yeah.
-- No household is complete without one, 

Homer seeks help from the church.

       
        [with Reverend Lovejoy]
Homer: Now I know I haven't been the best Christian.  In fact, when
       you're up there yak-yak-yaking, I'm usually either sleeping or
       mentally undressing the female parishioners.  Anyway, can I have
       $50,000?
        [Lovejoy's eyes widen]
-- Homer seeks help from the Christian Church, 

            
             [with Rabbi Krustofsky]
     Homer: Now I know I haven't been the best Jew, but I have rented
            "Fiddler on the Roof" and I will watch it.  Anyhoo, can I
            have $50,000?
Krustofsky: Hmm?
-- Homer seeks help from a synagogue, 

Homer seeks help from Surdrudinma Baradad, but gives it up.  Back at
home, Homer watches television, playing with a dreidel.

 Bart: Any luck, Dad?
Homer: No, but the rabbi gave me this.  [spins a dreidel]
 Bart: What is that?
Homer: Son, it's called a droodel.
-- Droodel, droodel, droodel, I made you out of clay, "Homer's Triple
    Bypass"

A television commercial comes on:

Nick: I'll perform any operation for $129.95!  Come in for brain surgery
      and receive a free Chinese finger trap!
       [escorts away a lobotomy patient with hands stuck in said device]
      All right, Fred.
      You've tried the best, now try the rest!
      Call 1-600-DOCTORB ["doct-orb"].  The B is for Bargain!
-- Nick Riviera's commercial, 

Homer's about to change the channel but Marge thinks this is the answer
he's looking for.  Marge tells Homer it's the only choice they have.


Oh, it could be worse.  Some dog could do the operation.
-- Homer can't afford a coronary bypass, 

Lisa says "What operation?".  Homer doesn't want to tell them, because
it might upset them.

 Bart: Nothing you say can upset us.  We're the MTV generation.
 Lisa: We feel neither highs or lows.
Homer: Really?  What's it like?
 Lisa: Ehh.  [shrugs]
-- 

Homer: I'm going to tell the truth and I'm _not_ gonna sugar-coat it.
        [later, does a puppet show]
       And so the tiny aorta fairies will take Mr. Leg Vein on a long
       trip to marry to Ms.  Left Ventricle.
-- Homer breaks the news to the kids, 

Lisa realizes that Homer is getting a coronary bypass operation.

Oh, no.  What if they botch it?  I won't have a dad-- for awhile.
-- Bart realizes Homer needs a coronary bypass, 

Homer: Kids, kids.  I'm not going to die.  That only happens to bad
       people.
 Bart: What about Abraham Lincoln?
Homer: He sold poison milk to school children.
-- Thinking on his feet, 

At the hospital, Homer tries out the bed remote control thingy.  "Bed
goes up, bed goes down..." then discovers he has a bed next to Ned
Flanders.

Homer: What are you in here for?
  Ned: I'm having a kidney and a lung removed.
Homer: Who are you donating them to?
  Ned: First come, first served.
-- Altruism at the hospital, 

Ned asks what Homer's in for.

Homer: I got a bad heart.
  Ned: Homer, if I could give you my heart, I would.
Homer: Shut up, Flanders.
-- The heart of Flanders?  God forbid, 

Dr. Nick Riviera introduces himself.

   Nick: Hi everybody!  I'm Dr. Nick Riviera.
     PA: Doctor Riviera, Doctor Nick Riviera.  Please report to the
         coroner immediately!
   Nick: The coroner.  I'm so sick of that guy!  Well, see you in the
         operating place!
          [opens the door to be greeted by a reporting mob]
Shutton: Where are the bodies?
          [Nick shuts the door]
   Nick: Such a beautiful day.  I think I'll go out the window.
          [does so]
-- A real confidence-builder, 

At night, Ned Flanders prays.

Dear God, thank you for Ziggy comics, little baby ducks and Sweating to
the Oldies volumes One, Two and Four.
-- Ned Flanders prays, 

Homer begins a prayer of his own, but a nurse shushes him and points at
the "No praying" sign.

[End of Act Two.  Time: 13:11]

...and that's why God causes train wrecks.
-- Bart's Sunday School Teacher, 

Lisa asks a question.

    Lisa: My dad is very sick.  What's going to happen if he dies?
Albright: Well, if he's been good, he'll go to heaven.  In heaven, you
          get to do whatever you like best all the time.
           [Lisa imagines Homer in a cloud with a remote control]
   Homer: Cloud goes up, cloud goes down...
-- Sunday School advice, 

Back in the hospital, Homer enjoys his reclining bed when Abe comes in.
Krusty bursts in.

Krusty: Hey, hey!  Hoo-huh-huh-ha-ha!
 Homer: [gags]
Krusty: What's the matter.  Oh, yeah, my grotesque appearance!
         [laughs goofily]
 Homer: Well, I could use some laughter right about now.
Krusty: Well, there's nothing funny about what you're gonna go through.
        I should know, I'm in the zipper club myself.
         [bares his chest a little to show a scar]
         [smokes a cigarrette]
 Homer: You seem okay.
Krusty: Yeah?  Well, I got news for you.  [points at his head] This
        ain't makeup!
-- Krusty, you and your stories, 

Grampa visits Homer.

Abe: They say the greatest tragedy is when a father outlives his son.  I
     have never fully understood why.  Frankly, I can see an up-side to
     it!
-- Optimism in old age, 

Lenny and Carl visit Homer.

Lenny: All of us guys pitched in and made you a "Get Well" card.
Homer: Thanks, guys.
        [we see the back, it reads "EMERGENCY PROCEDURE - DO NOT
       REMOVE"]
 Carl: We had a hell of a time replacing you.
        [back at the plant, a brick hangs off a switch in Homer's
       workstation]
-- Quality bricks are hard to find, 

Barney and Moe visit Homer.

Barney: When I first heard about the operation, I was against it.  But
        then I thought, if Homer wants to be a woman, so be it!
 Homer: Barney, I'm not getting a sex change!
Barney: Huh?  What the hell am I supposed to do with this jumbo thong
        bikini!
-- Send it to Norway, maybe?, 

  Moe: Hey, Homer, I snuck you in a beer for old times' sake?
Homer: Thanks, Moe.  [drinks it]
  Moe: You know, Homer, that beer ain't free.
-- All right, andale, andale, 

Homer's family comes to visit him.

Homer: Now Marge, if the unthinkable should happen, you're going to be
       lonely.
Marge: Oh Homer, I could never remarry.
Homer: Darn right.  And to make sure, I want to be stuffed and put on
       the couch as a constant reminder of our marital oath.
-- With glass eyeballs, I bet, 

Marge invites the kids in.

Homer: Kids, I wanna give you some words to remember me by, if something
       happens.  Let's see...er...Oh, I'm no good at this.
 Lisa: [whispers into Homer's ear]
Homer: Bart, the saddest thing about this is I'm not going to see you
       grow up...Lisa: [whispers into Homer's ear]
Homer: ...because I know you gonna turn out well, with or without your
       old man.
 Bart: Thanks, Dad.
Homer: And Lisa...
 Bart: [whispers into Homer's ear]
Homer: I guess this is the time to tell you...
 Bart: [whispers into Homer's ear]
Homer: ...that you're adopted and I don't like you.
        [realizes] Bart!
 Bart: [whispers into Homer's ear]
Homer: But don't worry, because you've got a big brother who loves you
       and will always look out for you.
 Lisa: Oh, Dad.  [hugs him]
-- Final words, maybe, 

Dr. Nick watches a video about how to do a coronary bypass.

Doctor: [on TV] ...and then, you make the incision below the collarbone.
        [splurt]
  Nick: Oh, no.  Blood!
-- They didn't tell me about this in medical school, "Homer's Triple
    Bypass"

But then the screen fritzes into a cheezy talk show.

Oh, no, someone taped over the end of this!
-- Dr. Nick Riviera's poignant observation, 

Pumpkinhead: All we ask for is a little dignity and a little respect.
       Host: [sly] And a new candle every now and then?
Pumpkinhead: Yes, and a new -- [realizes] no!
              [the audience laughs]
-- A cheesy talk show, 

Lisa reads a book about heart surgery, when Marge comes in with the
laundry.

This is fascinating, Mom.  Did you know they're going to stop Dad's
heart for six whole minutes?
-- Lisa describes Homer's operation, 

Marge doesn't think she likes Lisa reading medical books, but Lisa says
it's very reassuring, and she learned a great deal from a cow's heart
she got at the butchers.

Operation time.  Lisa enters the amphitheater.

 Nick: Hi, everybody!
Crowd: Hi, Dr. Nick!
 Nick: If something should go wrong, let's not get the law involved!
       One hand washes the other.  Oh, that reminds me!  [washes his
       hands] [puts on operating gloves] These gloves came free with my
       toilet brush!
-- The operation begins, 

Dr. Nick Riviera puts Homer to sleep, and points at something just
before Homer gets put out to bed: "What the hell is that?"

Meanwhile, Patty and Selma bring out a snazzy-looking man for Marge.

Patty: Marge, this is Andre.
Andre: [with attempted sexiness] Hello.
Selma: I think you two would make a perfect couple.
Marge: My husband is alive!
Patty: Oh, so sorry.  Hope he pulls through.
Andre: Not me.
-- Marge waits during Homer's operation, 

At Moe's Tavern...

   Moe: Now let's have a minute of silent prayer for our good friend,
        Homer Simpson.
         [short silence]
Barney: How long has it been?
   Moe: Six seconds.
Barney: Do we have to start over?
   Moe: Hell no.
-- Six, sixty -- what's the difference?, 

     Apu: Poor Mister Homer.  Could it be that my snack treats are
          responsible for his wretched health?
Customer: I need some jerky.
     Apu: Would you like some vodka with that?
Customer: Oh, what the hell, sure.
-- Short-lived guilt, 

Dr. Nick Riviera stands there for a while, confused.  The nurse asks him
if he knows where to make the incision.

Nick: Calm down, Nick.  Just think back to medical school.
       [a college dorm filled with hippies and junkies]
Nick: [younger, to a pretty lady] Seriously, baby, I can prescribe
      anything I want!
-- 

Nick: I know I'm supposed to cut something, but what?
       [removes surgical mask] And where?
Lisa: [from the amphitheatre] Hey!  The incision should be made _below_
      the blockage!  Below!
Nick: Thanks, little girl!
-- Treat children as equals, they're smarter than you think, "Homer's
    Triple Bypass"

The knee bone's connected to the something,
The something is connected to the red thing,
The red thing is connected to my wrist watch --
Uh oh.
-- Dr. Nick reminds himself how to do medicine, 

The family wait fretfully outside.  Dr. Nick comes out.

Nick: Good news!  The operation was a complete success!
       [the ceiling shines]
-- And God smiled, 

They all cheer and meet Homer outside intensive care.

Lisa: All right, Dad!
Bart: You rule intensive care!
-- 

Homer's heart beats to the tempo of the Simpsons theme for a while, then
stops.  Homer beats his chest for a moment, and it finishes.

[End of Act Three.  Time: 19:43]
 EPISODE TITLE: Marge vs. the Monorail


EPISODE SUMMARY: 

   

 As the Flintstones theme blares, Homer's slumber at his safety console
 is broken by the five o'clock whistle.  With a Yabba-Dabba-Doo, Homer
 leaps into his car (crashing through the window) and speeds off.
   
   Simpson!  Homer Simpson!
   He's the greatest guy in history.
   From the!  Town of Springfield!
   He's about to hit a chestnut tree!
   -- Homer sings to himself, ``''
   
 And he's right.  Crash!

 At the plant, Lenny and Carl seal up another barrel of toxic waste.
   
   TOXIC WASTE -- DO NOT EAT.
   -- Warning labels save lives, ``''
   
 The two wonder where the waste gets taken.  Carl figures it's buried in
 an abandoned chalk mine.  Lenny thinks it's sent to a Southern state
 with a crooked governor.  Once the two leave, Burns and Smithers cart
 the barrel away.
   
   Smithers: Well, sir, where should we dump &lt;this&gt; batch [of nuclear waste]?
             Playground?
   Burns:    No.  All those bald children are arousing suspicion.
   -- Monty's kids, ``''
   
 At the park, Burns tries to shove another barrel into a hollowed-out tree.
 ``The last tree held nine drums!''  He indicates another tree stuffed
 with radioactive waste, glowing green, complete with purple tentacles
 and really scary squirrels.  Burns' nighttime undertaking is interrupted
 by EPA agents.

 In court (``Liberty and Justice for Most''), Burns is fined $3 million,
 which he pays.  On the spot.  In cash.
   
   Heh heh heh.  Oh, Andy Capp.  You wife-beating drunk.  Heh heh heh.
   -- Homer reads the funnies, ``''
   
 There will be a town meeting to decide how to spend the $3 million.
 Lisa dreams of spending it on the public schools.  Bart's dream
 is also vaguely school-related.  Marge thinks the money should be
 spent on something the whole town should be proud of.

 While everyone else is at Springfield Town Hall, Snake and his pals
 rob their homes.
   
   Quimby: We will now hear suggestions for the disbursement of the
           two million dollars.
   Lisa:   Don't you mean &lt;three&gt; million dollars?
   Quimby: [looks around nervously, adjusts his tie]  Of course.

   -- ``''
   
 Maude suggests they hire firemen to put out the blaze on the east side of
 town.  (Homer nixes the idea.)  Monty Burns (poorly disguised as Mr. Snrub)
 suggest the money be invested back into the power plant.  The idea is booed
 soundly.  With Smithers' help, he makes his escape.
   
   Apu:    I would like to see this money spent on more police officers.
           I have been shot eight this year.  As a result, I almost missed work.
   Wiggum: [to himself] Cry-baby.
   -- ``''
   
 While Marge presents her proposal to spend the money to fix up the
 absurdly dilapidated Main Street, Mayor Quimby entertains himself
 with pornographic playing cards.  Abe tries to voice his objections,
 but the crowd loves the idea and gives him credit for the idea.
 Just as the vote is about to be taken, a fast-talking gentleman
 introduces himself.  Lyle Lanley plays the crowd like he's done it
 a million times before.
   
   We're twice as smart as the people of Shelbyville.
   Just tell us your idea, and we'll vote for it!
   -- Mayor Quimby, ``''
   
 He unveils a model of the Springfield Monorail, just like the ones
 he sold to Ogdenville, North Haverbrook, and Brockway.  Whence follows
 a musical number.
   

 [End of Act One.  Time: 7:22]

 Driving home, Bart and Homer chant ``Monorail'' as the car goes over
 each pothole.
   
   Marge: I still think we ought to spend the money to fix Main Street.
   Homer: Well, you should've written a song like that guy.
   -- Another song-and-dance, ``''
   
 Mr. Lanley takes his spiel to Lisa's class, where he answers questions
 from the students.  Lisa asks a hard-hitting question, and Lanley smartly
 plays the man, not the ball, by complimenting Lisa on her astuteness,
 and never actually answering the question.
   
   You there, eating the paste.
   -- Lyle Lanley calls on a student in Lisa's class, ``''
   
 Homer watches a television advert for ``Truckasaurus: The Movie'',
 starring Marlon Brando as John Truckasaurus (celebrity voice impersonated).
 Then follows an ad (using somebody who looks startlingly like Homer as
 a demonstration) recruiting people to become monorail conductors.
 Homer decides that being a monorail conductor was his life-long dream.

 At the hastily-put-together Lanley Institute of Monorail Conducting...
   
   Lanley: Before we begin, is anyone here an investigative reporter?
   Man:    I am.  And she is.
   -- Why they're still writing for the Springfield Shopper,
      ``''
   
 He asks them and their hidden camera to leave.

 At home, Bart quizzes Homer from his study book.
   
   True or false?  You can get mono from riding the monorail.
   -- A difficult question on the MCATs (Monorail Conductors Aptitude Test),
      ``''
   
 Homer gets the question right.  Bart expresses his admiration.
   
   Homer: Do you want to change your name to Homer, Junior?
          The kids can call you Ho-Ju!
   Bart:  [appropriate pause]  I'll get back to you.
   -- Not to be confused with Ho-Ho's, ``''
   
 Barney guides a crane in placing the train on the track.  He turns to
 wave to Homer, which the crane operator interprets as the sign to drop
 the train.  The train falls, crushing a house.  ``Aw, I hate that sound.''

 In bed, Marge reads a book.
   
   Marge: According to this book, the monorail goes over 150 miles an hour!
          What if something goes wrong?
   Homer: ``What if.''  What if I stepped in the shower and slipped on a bar
          of soap?  ... Oh, my God!  I'd get killed!
   -- ``''
   
 Homer goes into salacious mode, but Marge isn't interested.

 At the Lanley Institute, the lesson concludes.
   
   MONO = ONE
   RAIL = RAIL
   -- Lesson at the Lanley Institute of Monorail Conducting,
      ``''
   
 Otto asks who gets to be conductor.  Lanley consults his notebook
 (in which he has drawn a picture of himself driving to Tahiti with
 a pickup full of cash) and arbitrarily selects Homer as the monorail
 conductor.

 While Homer shows off the steering compartment of the monorail, Marge
 finds an opossum family in the fire extinguisher compartment.  (No
 fire extinguisher is to be seen.)

 Marge goes to visit Mr. Lanley's office and, finding no one inside,
 lets herself in.  There, she finds Lanley's notebook.  She is startled
 by the appearance of Mr. Lanley.  ``How much did you see?''  ``Um,
 nothing incriminating.''  Lanley's demeanor brightens.  ``Good!''
 Marge quickly excuses herself.

 She drives to North Haverbrook, ``Where the monorail is king!'',
 claims the billboard.  It is a run-down town, where the locals are
 reluctant to discuss the monorail.  She is startled by Sebastian
 Cobb, whom Lanley hired to build the monorail.  He shows her what's
 left of it.  When asked what can be done, he answers, ``You just better
 have a damn good conductor.''

 Homer has locked the keys to the train inside.  A bent coat-hanger
 doesn't seem to help, so Homer tells Bart, ``Get a rock.''

 [End of Act Two.  Time: 13:27]

 At the grand opening of the Springfield Central Monorail Station,
 Kent Brockman reports on the myriad celebrities on-hand for the
 occasion, including a tattered Lurleen Lumpkin, fresh from her
 (so to speak) stay at the Betty Ford Clinic.
   
   Quimby: And now, I'd like to turn things over to our Grand Marshall,
           Mr. Leonard Nimoy.
   Nimoy:  I'd say this vessel could do at least Warp Five.
           [appreciative laughter from the crowd]
   Quimby: And let me say, ``May the Force Be With You!''
   Nimoy:  [annoyed]  Do you even know who I am?
   Quimby: [indignant] I think I do.  Weren't you one of the Little Rascals?
   -- ``''
   
 Lisa spots Lanley lugging suitcases of cash into a taxi.  She asks him
 if he's going to ride the monorail, but he seems to be in a bit of a hurry
 to leave.

 Homer (dressed in a bizarre uniform) fires up the engines and disengages
 the brake.  Inside the engine, we see a gear slip off its axle, a
 belt snap, sparks fly, and a Seld-M-Break rubber hose stretched to the limit.
 Marge and Mr. Cobb arrive...
   
   Marge: We're too late!
   Cobb:  I &lt;shouldn't&gt; have stopped for that haircut.  Sorry.
   -- Cut, too, the quick, ``''
   
 In the luxury car of the monorail (complete with painting of the Hindenburg
 disaster), Leonard Nimoy tells Star Trek anecdotes to an obviously
 uninterested gentleman.  At Homer's suggestion, Bart sticks his head out
 the window.  (Bart pulls it back in just in time.)

 The Seld-M-Break hose finally snaps, and the train accelerates out of
 control.  The ``Springfield Monorail'' sticker peels off, revealing
 a ``1964 World's Fair'' sign.  The brake lever fails to work.  Quimby
 wants to take charge of the situation, but Wiggum refuses to let him.
   
   Quimby: Watch it, you walking tub of donut batter!
   Wiggum: Hey, I got pictures of you, Quimby.
   Quimby: You don't scare me.  That could be &lt;anyone's&gt; ass!
   -- ``''
   
 To resolve the constitutional crisis, the two go to town hall.
 According to the town charter, as town constable, Wiggum gets a pig
 every month, as well, as ``two comely lasses of virtue true''.  Quimby
 takes a closer look, ``Hey, how many broads do &lt;I&gt; get?''  The two
 fight over the charter as the monorail zips past.

 One technician suggests cutting the power, but alas, the monorail
 is solar-powered.  (``Solar power.  When will people learn?'')
 But miracle of miracles, Springfield suffers a solar eclipse!
 The train grinds to a halt, and all celebrate.  The eclipse
 ends, and the train speeds off again.

 Lyle Lanley's nonstop flight to Tahiti is interrupted by a brief stop
 in North Haverbrook.  Once the plane touches down, the townsfolk
 storm the plane and repay Lanley for his work.
   
   Homer: Are we gonna die, son?
   Bart:  Yeah, but at least we're going to take a lot of innocent people.
   -- ``''
   
 Marge calls Homer on the radio.  Mr. Cobb tells Homer to find an anchor
 of some sort.  Homer looks at Bart and envisions him as an anchor.
 ``Think harder, Homer.''  Homer takes a lariat from a passenger, ties it
 to the metal `M' from the monorail sign and heaves it overboard.  Bart
 reminds him that he should tie the loose end of the rope to the train.
 The `M' anchor rips into the ground, destroying everything in its
 path.  It chops down Springfield's Tallest Tree, sending it crashing
 onto Jebediah Springfield's Birthplace.  Dr. Hibbert explains to
 Siamese twins that an operation to separate them is a long and
 costly procedure.  The anchor rope rips through them, separating
 them cleanly.  The makeshift anchor passes in front of ``Ye Olde
 Anchor Shoppe'', owned by Captain McAlister.  (``You call that an
 anchor?'')  It eventually hooks onto a giant donut atop a donut shop
 and brings the train to a stop.
   
   Donuts.  Is there anything they &lt;can't&gt; do?
   -- Homer, ``''
   
 The passengers exit on the emergency inflatable slides (in the event
 of a water landing...), and Leonard Nimoy notes, ``My work is done
 here.''  He beams out.

 As the camera pulls away from the scene, Marge's voice narrates:
 ``And that was the only folly the people of Springfield ever embarked
 upon.  Except for the popsicle stick skyscraper.  And the 50-foot
 magnifying glass.  And that escalator to nowhere.''

 The magnifying glass focuses the sun's rays on the skyscraper, igniting
 a fire.  Meanwhile, people rise to the top of a huge escalator, only
 to fall off when it reaches the top.

 The 1964 World's Fair


Randy Lambertus @{rl} gives us a brief history lesson:
\C
    The 1964 World's Fair was held in Flushing Meadows (a suburb of New
    York City proper), and it did feature a monorail in the `Amusements'
    area, on the south side.  The monorail was sponsored by AMF, the
    bowling people.  But unlike the one pictured in the episode, the cars
    hung from an overhead rail.  [Another important difference is that the
    World's Fair monorail cruised at a mind-boggling 1/2 mile per hour.]
    There were two tracks, with the trains running in opposite directions.
    It was an additional-cost item, not included in the general admission.
    It wandered along the outline of the `Amusements' and took a couple of
    minutes to traverse the entire length of track.  The overall color of
    the units were white with red trim, the AMF triangle at the front and
    back of each end.

    Near it was the UniRoyal Ferris wheel, a giant tire.  I believe it was
    moved to Uniroyal headquarters in Michigan? minus the ferris wheel
    guts.

    The 1964-65 New York World's Fair ran from April to October in the
    years 1964 and 1965. When the fair closed almost all the attractions
    were removed.  The only stuff left is the New York City pavilion
    (really from the 1939-40 fair), the NY State pavilion (now badly
    decomposed), the Singer Bowl (used for concerts, still?), the
    Unisphere (symbol of the fair) the Westinghouse time capsules from
    1939 and 1964 (under a monument), the Vatican marker for the display
    of Michealangelo's Pieta, the Port of Authority building (used as a
    heliport during the fair), and the Science Museum (called Rocket Park
    now?), oh yes, and Shea Stadium, and I think the Florida building on
    the lagoon (originally Billy Rose's Aquacade in the 1939 fair).
\eC
David M. Stein @{dms} continues the story:
\C
    While AMF sponsored the monorail, it was designed and built by a
    California engineering firm which was named WED.

    WED Stood for Walter Elias Disney... the engineering wing of Disney.
    That monorail ended up at Disneyland after the fair.  If I remember
    that set of monorails was retired in the late 60's.  The guy would
    have had to have gotten the thing from Disney.

    There were several other exhibits WED designed and built for other
    companies.  Namely Kodak (``It's a Small World''), GM ``An Evening
    with Mr. Lincoln'' (the first of the ``Hall of Presidents'')
    and General Electric's ``Carousel of Progress''.

 Homer's monorail outfit


Bill Oakley explains, ``Homer's monorail conductor outfit was designed
with the following joke in mind:
\C
    Homer:  Well, how do I look?
    Selma:  Like Darth Vader without the helmet.
\eC
This joke was cut out in a later draft of the script, but the design of
the outfit remained the same.  So, you see, his uniform was supposed to
be reminiscent of Darth Vader.''

to their complete surprise, he agreed.''

 That brief stopover in North Haverbrook


Rick Kitchen @{rnk} wonders how the people of North Haverbrook knew
that Lyle Lanley was on the plane, and in seat 3F.  Obviously, a scene
we didn't see was Lisa mentioning to Marge that Lyle Lanley seems to
be in a hurry to leave, upon which Marge reacts with one of her
classic gasps.  Mr. Cobb contacts his friends back home, and, in a
demonstration of unity and cooperation not unheard of in the world of
cartoons (see [8[FG]01]), the airline company and the people of North
Haverbrook work together to bring Lyle Lanley to vigilante justice.

 EPISODE TITLE: Selma's Choice


EPISODE SUMMARY:  {dh} {jt}

[Curly braces ({}) indicate scenes cut in syndication]

A motorcycle and flaming buses, with a crowd around it.  The
motorcycle revs up and prepares to ride. The pilot flips on his 
visor, which reflects the fire. The motorcycle rides off the ramp, 
leaps over all the flame, then lands on another ramp. The camera 
follows the cycle as he waves but it moves too far when he crashes 
into a wall.  It moves back to see the wreckage. An announcer speaks.

Announcer: Hey, Lance Murdock, you just jumped sixteen blazing school
	   buses. What are you going to do now?
    Lance: [groaning] I'm going to... Duff... Gardens!
-- Disneyland would be my second choice, 

Announcer continues, "Duff Gardens, home of the Whiplash!" as a
Murdock in casts climbs upward on a roller coaster, which reaches
beyond the clouds. Another announcer mumbles quickly, "To be
completed in 1994."  Murdock approaches an empty space in the coaster
and teeters over, screaming.

Now Murdock is in a centrifuge with water at the bottom, strapped to
the wall with other tourists. The announcer says "And the Washing
Machine!" Murdock gets a blast of water in the face.

Bart, Lisa, and Homer are watching the commercial on TV. They share
an amazed, "Wow!"

Now a shot of a fish wading through beer. The announcer, well,
_announces_: "See the happiest fish in the world at our fabulous
Beer-Quarium!" The camera turns to see that the fish is really upside
down and joins other fish and a squid in a big mug of beer. One fish
continually bumps his head into the wall. Another spins around and
moans. And another fish lets out a belch.

Homer gets out his keys.

Bart, warm up the car. We're going to Duff Gardens!
-- Homer, 

In Bart's room, Bart and Lisa are getting ready, putting on their
shoes and such. Homer briefs them on what to do:

    Homer: Now what do we say when we get to the ticket booth?
Bart+Lisa: We're under six.
    Homer: And I'm a college student! Heh heh heh.
-- Sneaky theme park tricks, 

Marge walks in, looking sad and upset.

Marge: Kids, I have some bad news. I'm afraid your great-aunt Gladys
       has... passed on.
 Bart: Gladys, Gladys... big puffy hair, about yea high, big dent in
       forehead?
Marge: No... Gladys looked more like your Aunt Patty.
 Bart: [thinks for a moment]  [shudders]  Oh yeah, there she is.
-- 

Marge: The funeral's in Littleneck Falls. I'm afraid we'll have to
       go to Duff Gardens some other time.
 Lisa: We understand.
 Bart: No use complaining about something you can't change.
Homer: [pouting] But I want to go to Duff Gardens. Right now!
Marge: Homer, quit pouting.
Homer: [still pouting] I'm not pouting. I'm mourning. Stupid dead
       woman.
-- The trip to Duff Gardens is cancelled, 

I'm not pouting.  I'm mourning.
-- Homer, 

The family is in the car, in funeral garb, preparing to go to
Duff Gardens. Bart and Homer sing "On Top of Spaghetti". Marge
reprimands them. "If you don't mind, we're on our way to a funeral."
Homer changes his tune: "Ding, Dong, the Witch is Dead."

The car approaches Patty and Selma standing outside their apartment,
with an impressive effect. Homer walks out of his car, and takes
a look at the sisters.

Homer: Patty, Selma, I'm sorry. [hugs them]
Selma: He's hugging us. What do we do?
Patty: Just close your eyes and think of MacGyver.
-- Homer meets his sisters-in-law, 

The family drives to the funeral. Patty and Selma sit in the car,
carrying cups full of cigarrette butts and ash. Patty shakes her
ash into a cup, then sighs.

Patty: I can't believe Aunt Gladys is really gone.
Selma: Her legend will live forever.
Homer: [imagining] Yeah. The legend of the dog-faced woman.
Homer: [laughs hysterically] Legend of the dog-faced woman! Oh, that's
       good!
Marge: HOMER!
Homer: Wha--? D'oh!
-- Talk about a mindslip, 

Can we please stop somewhere?  My butt's asleep...
-- Selma, 

The family pulls into a diner and sloppily eat their food. Homer
tries out the "Just for Kids" maze, but ends up in the mouth of a
crocodile.   He crumbles up the paper and tosses it on the floor,
where it joins a whole bunch of other papers. The waitress passes by,
and offers Homer another placemat...

Marge thinks we should all take a moment to remember Aunt Gladys.
Flashback to Marge's sisters running off a pier past Gladys, who
simply watches them and smiles. They leap into the water and pull a
skydiver formation in the sea. Back to reality, Marge realizes, "Oh,
wait, that was `Prince of Tides.'"

{During the trip, Bart and Lisa play `the counting game' as luggage
falls from the roof of the car. "Nine, ten..."}

In the funeral home, the preist is delivering a eulogy.

He was a caring man, he was a kind man. He gave to his community and
asked little in return. He--
 [A man whispers something in his ear.]
[surprised] That's a _woman_? Oh, dear God!
-- The priest delivers his eulogy, 

Patty: [walks up to the podium] Take a hike, bozo. And that eulogy
       better not show up on the bill.
       I'll keep this short. Gladys lived alone, died alone. I guess
       you could say she was a role model for Selma and me. She
       wasn't a rich woman--
	[everyone gets up and leaves]
       -- but she was rich in spirit.
	[a man returns]
  Man: Forgot my hat.
-- Aren't I the popular one, 

"Trumpet Voluntary" plays as Bart approaches the coffin. He lifts up
Gladys' arm and drops it again, and does it over until Homer stops
him. Homer warns him not to hassle the dead. "They have eerie
powers."  Bart simply snorts and walks away. Homer looks at the
coffin and thinks to himself.

Homer: [thinking] Oh, I thought this thing was going to be catered.
       Boy, am I hungry. I mean, I'm really, really, hungry.
	[out loud] It's just not fair, dammit!
-- Homer really cared, 

Homer bangs his fist on the coffin and Marge comes by and leads
him away.  Lisa walks by and talks to Gladys.

Lisa: Good-bye, Aunt Gladys. I wish I had taken some time to get to
      know you better.
Bart: [from behind the coffin]
       [raspy] Don't worry about it.
      [Lisa screams and runs away from the coffin]
       Hahahaha!
-- I told you they had eerie powers, 

OFF, Selma, Patty and Jackie are in a room, when Lionel Hutz walks
in.

Hi, I'm Lionel Hutz, executor of Gladys Bouvier's estate. She left a
video will, so I earn my fee simply by pressing this "Play" button.
Pretty sweet, eh?
-- Lionel Hutz, 

The video is Gladys sitting on a chair.

Gladys: I would like to begin by reading a passage from Robert Frost.
	"Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, and...--"
	 [the tape fast-forwards. Homer did the deed.]
 Marge: Homer!
 Homer: All in favor of skipping the poem?
	 [everyone but Marge raises their hands]
 Homer: Thank you. [continues fast-forwarding]
-- A boring poem recital, 

The tape then continues...

Gladys: "... and that has made all the difference." Now let's get down
	to business. [Hutz's voice on the tape] To my executor, Lionel
	Hutz, I leave $50,000.
 Marge: MR. HUTZ!
  Hutz: You'd be surprised how often that works, you really would!
-- It worked in Kamp Krusty, 

Gladys: To Marge, I leave my potato chips that resemble celebrities.
	They're all here -- Otto von Bismarck, Maurice Chevalier,
	right down to Jay Leno. These chips were my children,
	Marjorie -- take special care of them.
	 [Homer eats said chips]
 Homer: [looking at them] Uh oh.
	 [continues to eat]
-- Bunker Hill was a worthless battle anyway, 

Gladys: To my sister Jackie, I leave my pet Iguana, Jub-Jub.
Jackie: Why didn't she just leave me the bowel obstruction that
	killed her?
-- 

Gladys leaves Patty and Selma a grandfather clock and a warning to
raise a family. She says, "Don't die lonely like me. Raise a family,
and do it now! Now! Now!"  Her words strike home with Selma, but
Patty is grateful for the grandfather clock.

The grandfather clock gongs at 12:00 midnight, and the family is
driving home. Homer is driving with Marge at his shoulder, and the
kids are sleep. Patty is asleep too, snoring loudly, but there is
no sleep for Commander Selma!  (Heh heh heh...) Selma is awake with
thought, and nudges Patty awake.

Selma: Aunt Gladys was right. There's something missing in our lives.
Patty: Don't worry. We'll get that barking dog record tomorrow.
-- 

Selma wants a baby, and Maggie fears for her life.

[End of Act One.  Time: 7'04"]

Selma's in a dating service room. A guy with a camcorder looks on,
while Selma sits in a chair, and lights up.  The cameraman tells
Selma to tell about herself. Selma tells the camera: "Well, I want to
have a baby before it's too late. You're looking at a free lunch,
boys.  Come and get it."  She growls amorously, and sticks her
cigarette into her mouth, and opens her mouth later, the cigarette
tied in a knot and put out.

Back to the loch with you, Nessie!
-- Groundskeeper Willy watches a date tape of Selma, 

Selma is with Princess Opal. Opal holds a love potion.

 Opal: [Gypsy accent] One drop of this love potion, and you will have
       any man you desire.
	[puts a drop on her tongue]
Selma: What are the magical ingredients?
 Opal: [Brooklyn voice] Oh, mostly corn syrup, a little rubbing
       alcohol.  You'll be lucky if it doesn't make your hair fall
       out actually.
	[looks at the bottle: "TRUTH SERUM"]
       Aagh!
-- A mistake anyone could make, 

Selma is shopping in a supermarket, her bags being put away by the
puberty kid, with a black guy (Arnold) on checkout.

The kid asks her something:

   Kid: Paper or plastic?
 Selma: You decide. [looks down] So, wearing a belt, are you?
   Kid: Uh-huh.
 Selma: No suspenders for you.
   Kid: [pauses] I guess not.
 Selma: Orange is really your color.
   Kid: They make us wear this.
 Selma: Shall we continue this conversation over dinner?
   Kid: Uh -- I'm not allowed to date customers. It's store policy.
Arnold: No, it isn't.
   Kid: [kicks him in the shin, whispering] Shut up!
Arnold: No, go for it, man!
-- Yeah, right!, 

In the DMV, Selma is giving the eye test to -- Hans Moleman. She puts
him through, pointing at each letter.  Hans struggles through the
letters. Selma stamps Hans' license "VOID". Then she stops to look at
it.

Selma: Wait a minute. It says here you're single.
 Hans: Did I do wrong?
-- You sure did, 

Selma at a restaurant with Hans. Hans is reading a menu, listing some
food items, among other things. The waitress passes by: "You're
reading the wine list, sir." Hans says "Very good." Later, Selma
driving Hans to her home.  "I don't know how to thank you for
dinner,"   Hans says. "Use your imaginaton," responds Selma, and
flutters her eyelashes flirtatiously.  Hans puckers up to kiss Selma.
Selma reels back, disgusted, thinking of what it would be like to
have children with this man: sightless, stupid kids. She throws him
out.

Selma: Get out of my car. [drives off]
 Hans: This isn't my house.
-- Selma ends a date, 

The family and Patty watch TV, another ad for Duff Gardens.

Anncr: Come to Duff Gardens, where roaming gangs aren't a problem
       anymore.
       Now featuring the clean-shaven sound of "Hooray for Everything"!
	[A large auditorium with the gang in a beer-bottle construct.]
  All: Hey, kids. Take a walk on the wild side!
  Boy: And all the races sing...
  All: Shoo-be-doo, shooby-dooby-doo, shoo-be-do, shooby-dooby-doo,
       yeah!
-- Clean-shaven sounds, indeed, 

 Bart: Can we go to Duff Gardens this weekend?
Homer: Sure. Unless another aunt dies.
-- 

Selma walks in.

Marge: Selma! You're back from your date already?
Selma: Yeah. I was so upset I ate a jar of expired olives. [sighs] I
       guess I'll never have a baby.
 Lisa: Aunt Selma, this may seem a little presumptious, but have you
       ever considered artificial insemination?
Homer: [laughs] I don't know. You gotta be pretty lame to make it
       with a robot. [Marge whispers in his ear] I knew that.
-- Making it with sperm in a cup, 

Selma's in a sperm bank, talking with a doctor.

 Selma: How do I know I'm getting quality?
Doctor: Don't worry. Our donors have to pass a rigourous screening
	process.
	 [Barney walks in a nurse's desk holding a cup]
Barney: All done!
 Nurse: Thank you, sir.
Barney: Always a pleasure. [looks at a baby] What a beautiful little
	girl.
	 [the baby burps like Barney]
-- Except for that guy, 

Marge is in Patty and Selma's apartment, reading a catalog along with
the sisters.

Marge: "101 Frozen Pops." [turns the page] A Nobel Prize Winner! An NBA
       All-Star! Ooh, one of the Sweathogs.
Selma: I checked. It's not Horshack.
-- Not Horshack? Get outta here, 

Marge tries to get Selma to think twice about having a baby this way.
Patty agrees. "You've had some bad experiences ordering out of
catalogues. Remember that mail order husband?" Flashback, the
doorbell rings in the twins' apartment, and Selma opens the door to
see a handsome man holding flowers. "Ooh, you look just like your
picture."  It's actually a cardboard cutout, and it drops to the
floor.

Back to reality.

Selma: Sorry, my mind's made up.
Patty: Why do you want to have a baby so bad?
Selma: I got a lot of love to give, and right now my only outlet is my
       ham radio.
Radio: [speaking foreign language] I have a ham radio.
Marge: Are you sure about this? A baby can really change your life.
Patty: You'll have to give up smoking.
Selma: I'll chew.
Patty: No man will ever want you.
Selma: All I got now is sperm in a cup.
Marge: Mmm.
Patty: Mmm.
Marge: Mmm.
Patty: Mmm.
Marge: Mmm.
Patty: Mmm.
-- She's got a point there, 

Marge and Homer are in bed, when Bart and Lisa run up to them.

       [Bart and Lisa talk simultaneously]
       [Bart pulls back the covers]
       [Homer looks grotesquely sick]
Bart: Oh, man, Dad's dead.
-- Can we still go to Duff Gardens?, 

Marge asks Homer if he's been eating a certain sandwich. Flashback
to the company picnic, where a large submarine lays on a table. Carl
talks to Homer.

 Carl: We hardly made a dent in that ten-foot hoagie.
Homer: I'll give it a good home.
	[flash to Homer in front of the TV, eating the sandwich.]
Marge: You've been eating that sandwich for over a week. I think the
       mayonnaise is starting to turn.
Homer: Two more feet, and I can fit it in the fridge.
	[flash to Marge walking up to Homer with a sandwich-looking
       thingamabob.]
Marge: Homer, I found this behind the radiator. I really think you
       should throw it away.
Homer: Suggestion noted.
	[when Marge leaves, Homer chows down]
-- Mmm, botulism, 

Back to reality.

Homer: Marge, I'd like to be alone with the sandwich for a moment.
Marge: Are you going to eat it?
Homer: [pause] Yes.
-- Honesty is the best policy, 

Marge: You look awful!
Homer: I don't care. I'm going to Duff Gardens!
	[his face quivers and he drops to the floor, crawling away]
-- A man with a mission, 

In the car. Homer shivers inside a blanket, his skin looks extremely
pale.

Homer: S-s-ssoo coolld...
Marge: Homey, your lips are turning blue. I think you'd better stay
       home.
Homer: No! Duff Gardens, hurraaahhh... [faints on the car horn]
-- That's what you get for eating months-old hoagies, 

Selma's in the car with the kids. Marge is staying with Homer.

Marge:  I want to thank you for taking care of the kids on such
       short notice.
Selma: We'll have fun, won't we kids?
 Bart: To get to Duff Gardens, I'd ride with Satan himself.
Selma: That's the spirit. 
-- 

 Lisa: Bye, Dad, don't eat any solids.
Homer: But I love solids.
-- They're so sweet and tasty, 

     Bart: It won't be any fun without you, Dad.
	    [the car shoves off]
Bart+Lisa: YAY!
-- The kids head to Duff Gardens, 

Homer reprimands the hoagie, but ends up huggng it, and Marge slaps
Homer on the back and he drops the sandwich into the trash.

[End of Act Two.  Time: 13'11"]

Bart, Lisa, and Selma approach Duff Gardens.

 Lisa: [reading from the pamphlet] The Duff Beer-amid contains so much
       aluminum it would take five men to lift it. Twenty-two immigrant
       laborers died during its construction.
Selma: Eh, there's plenty more where that came from.
-- Selma, anti-immigrant, 

They're in the park. A fat lady holds balloon and Lisa points.

 Lisa: Look! The Seven Duffs!
 Bart: There's Tipsy and Queasy...
 Lisa: There's Surly and Remorseful...
	[Surly pushes Remorseful aside]
	[a kid takes a picture of Surly]
Surly: Take a picture, it'll last longer. Get outta here.
	[the kid runs off]
-- Truly in character, 

"Hail to the Chief" plays as Selma, Bart and Lisa attend the Duff
Hall of Presidents. Of course, they're all robots. Abe Lincoln stands
up.

Lincoln: Four score and seven years ago, our forefathers brewed a
	 refreshing drink from hops and barley. [drinks his Duff and
         starts beatboxing] We-e-ll, I'm Rappin' A.B. and I'm here to
	 say, if you want to drink beer, well Duff's the only way! I
	 said the only way! Break down!
	  [crushes a beer can on his head]
   Lisa: This is a disgrace.
  Selma: Hey, if it's this bad, it has to be educational.
-- I sincerely doubt it, 

But Selma catches Bart pulling down Washington's pants. Washington's
eyes glow and he looks menacingly at Bart, who pulls back.

{At home, Marge hospitalizes Homer, who is wearing the Foam Dome.}

{What are the odds to getting sick on a Saturday?  A thousand to one.}
-- Homer, 

{Marge presents rented video tapes to Homer.  Homer likes the sounds
of Yentl, so Marge presumes he must be delirious.}

Bart, Lisa and Selma are at the souvenir stand. Bart spots something
interesting:

 Bart: [reading] "BEER GOGGLES: See life through the eyes of a drunk."
	[puts them on]
	[Selma becomes a foxy lady]
Selma: You're charming the pants off of me.
 Bart: [removing glasses] What did you say, Aunt Selma?
Selma: I said take off those damn glasses!
-- At Duff Gardens, 

Selma collapses on a bench, but Bart and Lisa refuse to be stopped.
They drag Selma along to an extremely long line.  She grunts, but
Bart says "If the line's this long, it's got to be good." It's
actually the complaint line. The complaint line lady pointedly tells
off a hippie.

Back at the Simpsons household. Homer and Marge watch Yentl together,
which Homer actually enjoys?!

Marge: Homer, you've cooled down!
Homer: That's what you think! Rrowr! [grabs Marge]
-- Feeling hot, 

Marge: [laughs] You know, I rented another movie, in case you felt
       better.
	[hands it to him]
Homer: "The Erotic Adventures of Hercules".
Marge: With Norman Fell as Zeus.
Homer: Woo-hoo!
-- 

Bart, Lisa and Selma "enjoy" a horrid little ride of commercialism,
jingles and robots. They watch boredly until Bart finally states his
opinion:

Bart:  I want to get off.
Selma: You _can't_ get off, we have five more continents to visit.
-- The kids and Selma ride "Little Land of Duff", 

Bart dares Lisa to drink the "water", but she's unsure. After a round
of chicken clucks and "Quit it!"s, Selma orders Lisa to drink the
water.  Well, since she has no choice, Lisa takes a sip. The world
turns swirly, and reality fades away as the water's poisons take
effect.  Selma looks like a huge monster to Lisa. "What's wrong? You
just put your head right here," but Selma's shoulder turns into a
mouthly beast. Lisa yells and tries to whack the rest of the guys 
(that's a woman?!) with an oar.

Back in the Simpsons household. Homer and Marge watch the X-rated
video.  It's typical plotless fare.

Lisa walks out of the ride, sputtering and snarling, carrying a
Hawaii robot. She tosses it aside and walks away like a drunkard. 
Bart runs off in a separate direction. Selma follows them out, then
stands and yells for the kids. Lisa has teetered into the Electrical
Parade.  On Cloud Nine, Lisa swirls around and looks at her own 
hands, and waves them in front of her.

I can see the music!
-- Lisa after getting whacked up on "water", 

Bart's on a high-speed roller coaster, just making the required
height.  He's measured by a worker, who lets him on. But Bart had
candied apples on his feet.  The strap that comes down on him is
barely protective as the released car flies off, leaving Bart hanging
on for dear life by the bar.  After a slight bureaucratic hesitation,
the ride is stopped - at the top of a loop. Bart hangs for dear life
downward, and Selma and Surly watch from below.

Selma: Surly, can't you do something.
Surly: Ey, Surly only looks out for one guy -- Surly.
Selma: Hm, sorry, Surly.
Surly: Shut up!
-- Don't mess with Surly, 

In the security office, Selma tries to talk things over with the
personnel.

Don't blame these kids, it's not their fault. I think their father's
missing a chromosome.
-- Selma blames the Duff Gardens incident on Homer, 

The officer reprimands her because Bart did so much wreckage.

Officer 2: We found this one swimming naked in the Fermentarium.
	    [Lisa, heaping jittery, covered by a towl]
     Lisa: [raises her arms] I am the Lizard Queen!
-- Lisa whacked out on wowee sauce, 

A fellow hands Selma lots of pills and instructs her to give them
to Lisa.

 Selma: Thank you, doctor.
Doctor: Oh, I'm not a doctor.
-- But I play one on TV!, 

At the Simpsons household, Marge is cooking beans when lo and behold,
mighty Homercles appears!

Homercles: Come to Homercles!
    Marge: [laughs] I can't! The beans will burn!
Homercles: Homercles cares not for beans!
	    [lifts up Marge on her shoulder]
-- Wow, he's in for some lovin', 

They walk into Selma and the kids returning from Duff Gardens. Marge
looks embarrassed.

Homer: Hi, kids, how was Duff Gardens?
 Lisa: Can't talk, coming down. [takes some pills]
-- Lisa under psychedelia, 

Selma: How do you do it, Homer?
Homer: You take an ordinary bedsheet, fold it around like th--
Selma: No, I mean raising kids! I just couldn't cut it today. All I
       wanted was a little version of me I could hold in my arms.
-- Then hold a snake, 

Back in her apartment, Selma hold Jub-Jub in her arms, while Patty
videotapes the moment.

Selma: Oh, Jub-Jub.
Patty: When I went to pick him up, Mom was trying to stab him with a
       hat pin.
-- Close enough, 

Selma sings "Natural Woman" to Jub-Jub.  The real music chimes in,
along with the singer.

[End of Act III.  Time: 19'49"]

"You Make Me Feel (Like A Natural Woman)" plays on the credits.
[I'm working off memory here -- please correct me if I'm wrong]

	 Oh, baby, what you've done to me
	 You made me feel so good inside
	 Now I just wanna be close to you
	 You made me feel so right

	 'Cause you make me feel
	 You make me feel
	 You make me feel
	 Like a natural woman

The Gracie tune is absent; instead the song ends and Selma says
flirtatiously, "Oh, yeah."

 EPISODE TITLE: Brother from the Same Planet


EPISODE SUMMARY: 

   

 A soccer field.  Nelson Mundt, attacker.  Bart Simpson, goalie.  A
 shot on goal.  It hits Bart in the face.  But Bart is pleased. ``I
 stopped it!''  ``And I hurt someone,'' adds Nelson.

 The soccer coach announces that the player selected to attend
 Pele's soccer and acting camp is none other than Nelson himself.
 Nelson is duly appreciative.  ``Thanks, Dad!''

 Bart can't join Milhouse, Richard, and Lewis on their quest to sneak into
 an R-rated movie (``Barton Fink'') because he told his Dad he'd wait
 for him.  Bart waits, alone.

 Before leaving to visit her sisters with Lisa, Marge reminds Homer
 to pick up Bart.  Homer answers, ``I'm on my way.''  Only after they
 leave do we discover that Homer was watching ``Wheel of
 Fortune''---and the state of the puzzle was ``I'm on my wa[]''.

 Storm clouds move in, and Bart sees a station wagon coming up the
 road.  But it's not Homer, only an amazing simulation.  The car
 splashes mud as it passes.  When rain begins to fall, Bart seeks
 refuge under a tree, which is immediately struck by lightning.  Bart
 sits in the road, drenched.

 Homer sits at home watching television.

 The wind lifts a nun into the air, and she flies away.  (``This
 isn't funny!'')  And curiously explodes when she lands.  Bart tries
 sending a psychic message, ``Pick up Bart.''

 In a trance, Milhouse writes ``Trab pu kcip'' on the wall and earns
 a scolding from his father.

 Homer watches a Green Bay football crowd bid a fond farewell to
 their star, Brian Bartlett Starr.  Homer has the funny feeling he's
 forgetting something.  The crowd chants, ``Bart!  Bart!''  The
 banner ``We'll never forget you, Bart!'' is unfurled.  Santa's
 Little Helper barks, ``Bart!  Bart!''  And even little Maggie
 removes her pacifier and burps, ``Bart.''

 To escape the noise, Homer takes a bath, still trying to remember
 what it is he's supposed to do, but all he can get is ``Pick a
 bar.''  Homer dozes off, and in his dream, he finds Bart's skeleton
 on the soccer field.  Homer dashes naked out of the tub and out the
 front door.

 Homer finally arrives (dressed) to pick up Bart.  ``Hey, boy!  How
 was soccer practice?''  Bart climbs into the car and says nothing.
 Homer tries to buy Bart's forgiveness with a chocolate sundae, but
 the car hits a bump, sending the ice cream atop Bart's head.  Homer
 tries to put the issue behind them, but Bart isn't buying.

 In his room, Bart watches Krusty as guest host of ``Tuesday Night
 Live''.  His monologue is a massive flop.
   
   We got a great show for ya!  Well, actually, the last half hour is a
   real garbage dump.
   -- Krusty the Clown hosts ``Tuesday Night Live'',
      ``''
   
 Bart muses, ``I miss Joe Piscopo.''  Next comes an advertisement for
 a ``Bigger Brothers'' program, and Bart calls.  ``My name is Bart
 Simpson, and I don't have a father.''  Meanwhile, ``Tuesday Night
 Live'' opens with a decidedly unfunny sketch.

 [End of Act One.]

 At the ``Bigger Brothers'' agency, Bart dons an accent and plays the
 r\^ole of a brave young boy whose father left him six years ago.
 The administrator assigns to Bart a bigger brother she has been saving.

 At school, a dynamic young man Tom arrives at school on his
 motorcycle, gives Bart his own helmet, and takes Bart away, to the
 awe of Bart's classmates.  ``Bart's dad has really put himself
 together!'' notes Martin.

 While Marge goes over the bills, Homer explains...
   
   Homer: Bart's not mad at me.
   Marge: He called you a bad father.
   Homer: Marge, when kids these days say `bad', they mean `good'.
          And to `shake your booty' means to wiggle one's butt.
          Permit me to demonstrate.
   -- So hot, it's cool, ``''
   
 Marge finds a $378.53 bill among the payables.
   
   Marge: Homer, do you have an explanation for this bill?
   Homer: Oh, it's that record club.  The first nine were only a penny.
          Then they jacked up the price!
          [breaks down crying] It's not fair!  It's not fair, I tells ya!
   -- ``''
   
 But the bill is a phone bill.  Somebody's been making calls to the
 Corey hot-line.  Lisa quickly hides in her room, the entrance to
 which is decorated by a Corey poster.

 Marge has a talking-to with Lisa.
   
   Marge: Why didn't you ask our permission, Lisa?
   Lisa:  I did!
          [begin flashback.  Homer watches television, Lisa stands in front.]
   Lisa:  Dad, can I...
   Homer: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
   -- A wink is as good as a nod, ``''
   
 Marge understands Lisa's plight.  She explains that when she was a
 girl, she had a crush on Bobby Sherman.  Lisa laughs uproariously.
 Marge tells Lisa to stop making the calls, and Lisa carefully says,
 ``I promise you'll never be billed for another call.''  Lisa then
 continues to laugh at the thought of Bobby Sherman.

 At Springfield Stadium, it's Tomato Day.  One free tomato with each
 paid admission.  Bart tells Tom that his former father gambled away
 the family's savings on a single hand of blackjack.
   
   Dealer: Nineteen.
   Homer:  Hit me.
   Dealer: [deals another card]  Twenty.
   Homer:  Hit me.
   Dealer: [deals another card]  Twenty-one.
   Homer:  Hit me.
   Dealer: [deals another card]  Twenty-two.
   Homer:  D'oh!
   -- Know when to say when, ``''
   
 The start of the game is delayed for an announcement from a
 recruiter from the Springfield Communist Party.  The attendees unleash
 their (not-yet rotten) tomatoes.  ``Well, this is better than Dog
 Day.''

 At Dr. Hibbert's office, while waiting for her ear-drops to sink in,
 Lisa is uncontrollably drawn to the wall telephone.  She dials.
   
   Hi, you've reached the Corey hot-line.  $4.95 a minute.  Here are some
   words that rhyme with Corey:  Gory.  Story.  Allegory.  Montessori.
   -- ``''
   
 After lifting weights with Tom, Bart settles down to watch some
 television.  But it's not Itchy and Scratchy.  It's Ren and Stimpy.
 Bart and Tom get a kick out of an absurdly disgusting scene.

 It's show-and-tell day.
   
   Bart: Someday, I want to be an F-14 pilot like my hero Tom.  He lent
         me this new weapon called a neuro-disruptor.
         [Bart aims it and fires it at Martin, who convulses and collapses.
         The other kids applaud politely.]
   Ms.K: He's not dead, is he, Bart?
   Bart: Naah, but I wouldn't give him any homework for a while.
   Ms.K: Very good, Bart.  Thank you.
   Bart: Oh, don't thank me.  Thank an unprecedented eight-year military build-up.
   -- ``''
   
 Martin is up next, but somehow his horsie doll fails to impress.

 Lisa pays Grampa a visit, who falls asleep in mid-sentence.  Lisa
 spots Grampa's telephone and dials.
   
   Hi, this is Corey.  Hope you and I can get married someday.
   -- Call 1-900-555-CORY, ``''
   
 Homer sits on the couch as Bart heads for the front door.
   
   Homer: Hey, boy.  Where ya goin'?
   Bart:  Father-son picnic.  [leaves]
   Homer: Have a good time! ... Wait a minute...
   -- ``''
   
 Principal Skinner leaves Lisa to inventory a storage room full of
 Glee Club peanut brittle while he sits down to slash forty percent
 out of the budget.  Which he does by deleting entire classes
 at a time.  He hears DTMF tones and immediately recognizes them as a
 900 number.  Skinner catches Lisa on the phone listening to Corey
 read the newspaper headlines.

 Tom takes Bart hang-gliding.
   
   Tom:  Hey, look at the forest fire down there.
   Bart: [uninterested] Yeah, great.
   -- ``''
   
   Bart: You've been really great to me, but there's probably some other
         kid who needs you even more.
   Tom:  Bart, I could kiss you.  If the ``Bigger Brothers'' didn't make
         me sign a form promising I wouldn't.
   -- Living in the age of cooties, ``''
   
 Homer spots Tom and Bart circling overhead through a pair of
 binocs and realizes what Bart's been up to.  When Bart returns,
 Homer does a Richard Burton on him.  When Bart asks what he's going
 to do, he merely answers, ``You'll see.''

 Homer pays a visit to the Bigger Brothers office.
   
   Administrator: And what are your reasons for wanting a Little Brother?
   Homer's brain: Don't say revenge!  Don't say revenge!
   Homer's mouth: Uh, revenge?
   Homer's brain: That's it, I'm gettin' outta here.  [footsteps, and a door slam]
   -- ``''
   
 The administrator ticks off ``revenge'' on the application and
 welcomes him to the agency.

 [End of Act Two.]

 The administrator gives Homer a list of boys who are in need of
 a Bigger Brother.  Homer goes through the book like a catalog.
 (``Ugly.  Wiener.  Crater-face.  Suey!  Suey!'')  Homer considers
 withdrawing his application but sees a young boy approach the
 desk in the next room.  ``Do you have a Bigger Brother for me yet?
 ... Okay, I'll be back in an hour.''  Homer presses his face to the
 window.  ``I'll take him!  Do you have him in blonde?''

 Marge has been called to school to talk to Lisa.  Marge suggests
 that if Lisa can hold out until midnight without calling, she will
 have licked her addiction.  Skinner advises Lisa to listen to her
 mother, commenting on his own relationship with his mother.
   
   Mother, that sailor suit doesn't fit any more!
   -- Principal Skinner gets weird again, ``''
   
 Marge and Lisa plot their escape.

 Homer pays a visit to the run-down part of town to pick up Pepe.
 Over ice cream, Homer tells stories of Bart.
   
   Homer: Son, I just want you to know I love you very much.
   Bart:  [shoves a half grapefruit in Homer's face]  Shut up!
          [end of flashback]
   Homer: Mmmmmm... grapefruit.
   -- ``''
   
 Homer shows Pepe a wonder of modern technology:  The automatic
 garage door.  But it doesn't open all the way.  Homer offers to take
 Pepe home, but Pepe asks to see the stars.

 That evening, the two recline on the porch, admiring the stars.
   
   Pepe:  Tell me more!  I want to know &lt;all&gt; the constellations.
   Homer: Well, there's... Jerry the Cowboy.  And that big dipper looking
          thing is Alan... the Cowboy.
   -- ``''
   
   Pepe:  Oh, Papa Homer, you are so learn\`ed.
   Homer: Heh heh heh.  `Learn'd', son.  It's pronounced `learn'd'.
   -- ``''
   
   Pepe:  I love you, Papa Homer.
   Homer: I love you, too, Pepsi.
   Pepe:  Pepe.
   Homer: Pepe.
   -- The Pepe challenge, ``''
   
 Lisa sits in the green chair saying to herself, ``Gotta make it to
 midnight.  Gotta make it to midnight.''  Maggie plays with a toy
 phone.  The clock nears 7pm.  Marge knits.  Lisa develops a twitch
 and finally explodes, shouting at poor Maggie, ``Must you be forever
 dialing that phone!''  Lisa then quietly excuses herself.

 Lisa watches the clock in her room.  It's only 11:24.

 Marge comes into Lisa's room, to find it empty.  Downstairs in the
 kitchen, she finds Lisa asleep at the table, the phone in her hand.
 Marge quietly muses, ``Oh, Lisa.  You tried your best.''  But when
 she picks up the receiver, Marge hears, ``At the sound of the tone,
 the time will be 12 midnight.''  Lisa wakes up.  ``I made it!''

 Homer and Pepe watch another absurdly violent Itchy and Scratchy
 cartoon.

 Bart fishes under his bed in search of his skateboard, to learn that
 Homer gave it to Pepe.
   
   You're not the &lt;only&gt; one who can abuse a non-profit organization!
   -- Homer, ``''
   
 Homer tries to recall the good ol' days.
   
   Homer: Remember when I used to push you on the swing?
   Bart:  I was faking it.
   Homer: Gasp!  Liar!
   Bart:  Oh yeah?  Remember this?  ``Higher, Dad!  Higher!  Whee!''
   -- ``''
   
 At Marine World (``No longer educational'') both Homer and Pepe and
 Tom and Bart attend ``Bigger Brothers Day''.  Homer teases a dolphin
 with a fish, pulling it just out of reach.  The dolphin steals
 Homer's hot dog instead.  Homer attacks the dolphin, but is taken
 away by security.  Bart and Homer spot each other, and Tom draws
 Bart away.  ``You know better than to talk to strangers.''  Homer
 explains that he's Bart's father.  Tom stops in his tracks.  ``His
 father, the drunken gambler?''  Homer brightly answers, ``That's
 right.  And who might you be?''  Tom answers with his fists.  Homer
 throws starfish (a la a martial arts film), which Tom catches and
 carefully places in a nearby tank.  A shark eats them.  (``D'oh!'')
 The fight continues.
   
   This just in.  A fistfight is in progress in downtown Springfield.
   Early reports indicate, and this is very preliminary, that one of the
   fighters is a giant lizard.  [inset of Godzilla] [to off-camera aide]
   Do we have a source on this? ...  Uh huh.  A bunch of drunken frat
   boys. ...  All right, I could use some names.  I. P.  Freeley.
   -- Kent Brockman's breaking news story, ``''
   
 The fight continues through an antiques shop, into Springfield
 Gorge, back up again, and finally ends back on the streets of
 downtown Springfield.  Homer is taken away in a stretcher.  Tom and
 Pepe sit on the kerb and muse (painfully obviously) on their
 respective losses.  Bart makes the obvious suggestion.  (Where am I,
 the planet cornball?)

 Homer and Bart sit on the couch.
   
   Another beer, Dad?
   -- Bart, ``''
   
   Bart:  Dad, remember when Tom had you in that headlock and you
          screamed ``I'm a hemophiliac'' and when he let you go,
          you kicked him in the back?
   Homer: Heh heh heh.  Yeah.
   Bart:  Could you teach me how to do that?
   -- ``''
   
 Father-and-son bonding continues.

The episode title is an obvious rearrangement of the title of this
movie by John Sayles. @{bw}

 When Harry Met Sally


Alan J Rosenthal @{ajr} was the first to point out that the synthetic
orgasm scene was not invented by ``When Harry Met Sally'', noting in
particular that the Steve Martin film ``All of Me'' contained a
similar premise.  Facts notwithstanding, I maintain that it is ``When
Harry Met Sally'' that, for better of worse, will be associated with
the concept inthe mind of the general public.

 The Flying Nun


This 60's sitcom starred Sally Field as a young nun working in a
convent in Puerto Rico.  Tropical breezes combined with her wing-like
headdress led to constant airborne adventures.  I am not making this
up.

And why did the Simpsons version of same explode?  Because it was funny.

 Bart Starr


Ethan Miller @{elm} explains that Bart Starr was the star quarterback
for the Green Bay Packers who led the team to victory in the first two
Super Bowls, as well as league championships before the Super Bowl was
invented.  He concludes that Homer was watching an NFL Films
production about the star quarterback.

 Other references


Robert Lopez @{rel} claims the grapegruit scene is a reference the
Cagney film ``The Public Enemy''.

Various attempts to reduce the fight scene to the level of a reference

 Reviews


Okay, this is getting silly.  The references are gratuitous.  The
plots are absurd.  Homer has become a caricature of himself.  What
happened to the days when plots were simple and Homer reflected our
own weaknesses?  After all, ``There's a little Homer Simpson in all of
us.''  Oh well, at least Homer hasn't been accidentally locked in the
basement.


 Boring distribution restrictions


Blah blah blah blah.

 EPISODE TITLE: I Love Lisa


EPISODE SUMMARY: 

   

 While Marty accidentally plays ``Monster Mash'' to start off KBBL's
 Valentine's Day schedule, Bart carefully paints insults on candy
 hearts.  At Springfield Retirement Castle, Grampa scoffs
 at the invented holiday---until he sees the card Jasper received
 from his grand-daughter.  And Moe receives a valentine from his
 secret admirer:  Barney.  Meanwhile, in the Simpsons household...
   
   Marge: And this is for my huggy-bug, in honor of this special day.
          [serves Homer breakfast of eggs and bacon, spelling out ``I
          love you'']
   Homer: [thinking]  Special day!?  Oh, what have I forgot now?
          Now don't panic.  Is it Bacon Day?  No, that's crazy-talk.
   Marge: [smile gradually fades from her radiant visage]
   Homer: [thinking] She's getting impatient!  Take a stab at it!
          [aloud]  Happy... Valentine's Day...
   Marge: [rubbing his head]  (*squeak*) (*squeak*)  Aw, thank you, dear.
   Homer: [in celebration] Woo-hoo!
   -- Not Bacon Day, &lt;Eggs&gt; and Bacon Day, ``''
   
 When Bart asks Homer what his gift to Marge is, Homer insists that
 nobody makes a big deal out of Valentine's Day.  Until he sees Ned
 serenading his beloved Maude.  Homer heads upstairs to get his, uh,
 gift, yeah, that's it.  The family follow his frantic footsteps
 through the hall, out the window (```Wauuuuuugh!'') onto the lawn...

 ... and into the Kwik-E-Mart.  Apu has just the thing:  A (dusty)
 heart-shaped box of chocolates.  He asks $100.  Homer refuses.  But
 Apu knows better.  Homer finally caves in and plunks down the money.
   
   If he discovers the discount supermarket next door, all is lost.
   -- Apu thinks to himself, ``''
   
   Apu:   Nickel off on expired baby food.
   Homer: Sold!
   -- Think of the money he's saving, ``''
   
 In class, Janey is anxious to begin exchanging valentines...
   
   Ms. Hoover: First, we're going to construct paper mailboxes to store
               the valentines.
   Lisa:       Isn't that just pointless busy-work?
   Ms. Hoover: [taps her nose] Bull's-eye.  Get cracking.
   -- Crack the bull-whip?  ``''
   
 Ralph has trouble with the project.
   
   Ralph:      My parents won't let me use scissors.
   Class:      [giggles and snickers]
   Ms. Hoover: The children are right to laugh, Ralph.  These scissors
               couldn't cut butter.  [demonstrates on her arm]
   -- All the better to slice you to pieces with, ``''
   
 Ralph has another problem:  He ate his red crayon.  The P.A.
 crackles to life.
   
   Attention everyone, this is Principal Skinner.  Some student (possibly
   Bart Simpson) has been circulating candy hearts with crude off-color
   sentiments.
   -- What can I say, I've got a weakness for the classics, ``''
   
 Principal Skinner emphasizes that Valentine's Day is no joke, as he
 slips into a flashback of Da Nang, 1969.  His pal Johnny is
 mercilessly gunned down as he addresses a valentine to his sweetie.
 Skinner's repeated cries of ``Johnny!'' echo through the school.
   
   Cool, I broke his brain!
   -- Bart, ``''
   
 The students' mailboxes complete, Miss Hoover allows the valentine
 exchange to begin.
   
   Miss Hoover, I glued my head to my shoulder  Heh.
   -- Ralph, ``''
   
 Valentine distribution begins, accompanied by a few paper airplanes.
 Everyone's box is brimming with cards, except for Ralph's, which
 is empty.  Noting Ralph's sad state, Lisa quickly re-addresses one
 of her valentines and gives it to Ralph.  The card reads, ``I
 Choo-Choo-Choose You, Happy Valentines''.  Lisa cheerfully wishes
 Ralph a ``Happy Valentine's'' as she returns to her seat.  Ralph
 sighs heavily, clutching the card to his breast.

 In the cafeteria, Bart eagerly awaits the special Valentine's Day
 lunch.  A truck-load of surplus beef hearts is delivered---on the
 floor.  Bart takes a bite, then clutches his heart in pain.
 ``Baboon heart... my body... rejecting it...''  A heart pops out of
 Bart's shirt.  The other students scream in disgust.

 The school bell rings, and Ralph is waiting as Lisa walks past.  He
 accosts her and offers to walk her home.  Lisa reluctantly agrees.
 Ralph tries to make small talk, but doesn't seem to be making much
 progress.
   
   ... and my doctor said I wouldn't have so many nose-bleeds if I kept my
   finger out of there.
   -- Thank you Ralph, very graphic, ``''
   
 Lisa proclaims, ``Well, here's my house,'' and rushes inside...

 ... past Bart and Homer watching Itchy and Scratchy.  Another
 insanely violent cartoon, with a Valentine's theme.  Krusty appears,
 in a tuxedo.
   
   Hey, kids!  Don't forget to watch my 29th Anniversary Show, featuring
   clips like this one of Sideshow Mel wacked out on wowie-sauce!
   -- Krusty, ``''
   
 Said clip appears.  Sideshow Mel, clearly drunk, tells off Krusty
 big time.
   
   Bart:  I'd do anything to go to that show!
   Homer: I'd sell my first-born son!
   Bart:  Hey!
   Homer: You'll do as you're told!
   -- And if he doesn't, you can always exchange him (again), ``''
   
 Lisa explains her predicament to Marge.  Homer overhears it as he
 grabs a beer from the fridge.
   
   Ah, sweet pity.  Where would my love life have been without it?
   -- Homer, ``''
   
   Lisa:  What do you say to a boy to let him know you're not interested?
   Marge: Well, honey, when I...
   Homer: [puts up a hand] Let me handle this, Marge, I've heard 'em all.
          [enumerating them on his fingers]  ``I like you as a friend.''
          ``I think we should see other people.''  ``I don't speak English.''
   Lisa:  I get the idea.
   Homer: [not getting the hint] ``I'm married to the sea.''  ``I don't
          wanna kill you, but I will.'' ...
   -- What?  And break the code of the schoolyard?  ``''
   
 Marge suggests Lisa tell Ralph she's flattered, ``but you're just
 not ready for this kind of thing.''
   
   Six simple words:  I'm not gay, but I'll learn.
   -- Homer's advice to Lisa on how to dissuade a suitor, ``''
   
 Lisa takes Marge's rather than Homer's advice.  At home, Ralph
 approaches his father, Chief Wiggum (still in uniform), who is busy
 smashing walnuts with the butt of his pistol.  Wiggum explains that
 the key is persistence.  ``Keep at it and never lose your cool.''
 When a nut refuses to crack, Wiggum takes a step back and shoots the
 nut.
   
   Let that be a lesson to the rest of you nuts!
   -- Chief Wiggum addresses a bowl of walnuts, ``''
   
 When Ralph asks if persistence is how Chief Wiggum met his wife,
 Wiggum adds, ``Never underestimate the appeal of a man in uniform.''
 As he reclines, his ample gut spills out of its uniform.

 [End of Act One.  Time: 8:00]  (Don't be fooled by the premature
 fade to black.)

 ``Only four days 'til my 29th anniversary show!''  Krusty gloats on
 the fact that the critics who predicted an early demise to his show
 have themselves met their demise.  Then introduces a clip in which
 Krusty learns why the urine monkey gets its name.
   
   That's funny for so many reasons.
   -- Bart, ``''
   
 Lisa agrees, but points out that ``to get those tickets, our parents would
 have to be part of Springfield's cultural elite!''
   
   Can you believe Flanders threw out a perfectly good toothbrush?
   -- Homer, ``''
   
 The doorbell rings.  Seeing that it's Ralph, Lisa hides.
   
   Lisa:  Just make up some excuse!  [running to hide]
   Homer: [answering the door]  She's in the can.  Go away.
   -- ``''
   
 When Ralph professes, ``I'd do anything for Lisa,'' Homer decides to
 take him up on the offer.  Ralph gets dizzy from the tar fumes while
 reshingling the Simpsons roof, as Homer supervises from his hammock
 down below.

 Auditions for the President's Day Pageant are under way.
   
   Since boyhood, I have yearned to be on the one-dollar bill...
   -- Auditions for the part of George Washington, ``''
   
 Rex takes a bow and returns to his seat.  Miss Hoover announces the
 r\^oles.  Lisa will play Martha Washington, and the r\^ole of George
 Washington is given to... Ralph.  Rex is outraged, but Miss Hoover
 insists the decision was fair.  She not-too-subtly opens and closes
 the window shades, signalling Chief Wiggum outside, who graciously
 instructs his men to remove the `boot' from her car.

 While explaining her predicament to Bart, Lisa hears a knock at the
 door, but no one's there.  On the doorstep is a wrapped present: A
 Malibu Stacy convertible, with the card, ``Look in the tunk
 [sic].''  And in the tunk are two tickets to Krusty's anniversary
 show.  Bart complains about the unfairness of it all.
   
   I'm ten times the Krusty fan you are.
   I even have the Krusty Home-Pregnancy Test!
   -- Bart plans ahead, ``''
   
   Lisa: I'm not sure if I &lt;should&gt; go.  I don't even like him.
   Bart: You're right, Lis, you shouldn't go.  It wouldn't be honest.
         &lt;I'll&gt; go, disguised as you.
   Lisa: But what if he wants to hold hands?
   Bart: I'm prepared to make that sacrifice.
   Lisa: What if he wants to kiss?
   Bart: I'm prepared to make that sacrifice.
   Lisa: What if...
   Bart: You don't want to know how far I'll go.
   -- The things people will do for love, ``''
   
 Homer hangs a diploma from Oral Roberts University, scratching out
 ``Ned Flanders'' and writing his own name in its place.
   
   Lisa:  Dad, is it all right to take things from people you don't like?
   Homer: Sure it is, honey.  You &lt;do&gt; mean stealing, don't you?
   -- Haven't we gone through this before? ``''
   
   Lisa:  My conscience is bothering me.
   Homer: Your conscience!?  Lisa, don't let that pushy little weenie
          tell you what to do.  [a tiny Homer-angel appears]
   Homer's conscience: Homer, that's a terrible thing to say.
   Homer: Aw, shut up!
   Homer's conscience: [meekly] Yes, sir.  (*poof*)
   -- ``''
   
 Chief Wiggum chauffeurs Ralph and Lisa to the anniversary show in
 the back seat of a police car.  Lisa asks how he got the tickets,
 and Wiggum explains.  At the Springfield-X theater, Krusty watches
 ``Debbie Does Springfield'' as Chief Wiggum enters (&lt;still&gt; in
 uniform) munching on popcorn.
   
   Ah, nothing beats a good porno movie.
   -- Chief Wiggum, ``''
   
 Krusty nervously asks, ``Is this a bust?''  Wiggum quickly agrees.
   
   Lisa:         That story isn't suitable for children.
   Chief Wiggum: Really?  I keep my pants on in this version.
   -- ``''
   
 Lisa quickly returns to her seat.

 The show begins.  In the audience are Bill and Hillary Clinton.
   
   Hey, Mr. President!  I campaigned for the other guy, but I voted for you!
   -- Krusty, ``''
   
 Krusty tells a lame joke, and even though the `Applause' sign
 flashes, the audience remains silent.  Krusty quickly introduces a
 clip of Robert Frost in 1963 reading one of his poems.  Krusty makes
 faces at the camera, then asks, ``Hey, Frostie!  Want some snow,
 man?''  He pulls a rope, which dumps a huge load of synthetic snow
 on the poet.  Frost continues his poem.  The President laughs
 uproariously.

 Next clip is from 1973, ``Kroon Along With Krusty''.  A
 rock-and-roll Krusty sings, backdropped by psychedelic Laugh-In
 colors.  (``What was I on?'')

 Ralph asks Lisa if she'd like a bite of his ice cream.  Lisa
 politely declines, but Chief Wiggum (sitting next to Lisa) accepts
 the offer.  As the transfer is made, the chocolate falls into Lisa's
 lap.

 Krusty introduces a clip with Sideshow Raheem.  After the clip,
 Krusty is in the audience.
   
   Now, for my favorite part of the show.  ...  [squinting]  What's that say?
   -- Krusty, ``''
   
 It's the dreaded ``Talk with the audience'' part.  As Krusty wanders
 the audience in search of a victim, Lisa quietly pleads, ``Oh no,
 don't show me with Ralph.''  Too late.  Ralph professes his love for
 Lisa and promises to marry her when he grows up.  Unable to stand it
 any longer, Lisa lets out a prolonged yell and adds, ``I don't like
 you.  I never liked you.  And the only reason I gave you that
 valentine is that nobody else would!''

 Freeze-frame.

 Watching a videotape of the incident, Bart narrates the scene
 frame-by-frame.  ``Watch this, Lis.  You can actually pinpoint the
 second when his heart rips in half.''  He does so.  Lisa covers her
 face.

 [End of Act Two.  Time: 14:14]

 Even the ducks in the pond spurn Ralph.  When Chief
 Wiggum learns that Lisa made a fool of his son (wasn't he there?),
 he announces, ``Well, she didn't reckon with the awesome power of
 the Chief of Police!''  But first, he has to find his badge.

 Homer is pulled over for having a broken tail-light.  Though nothing
 seems wrong until Chief Wiggum smashes it with his baton.
   
   Homer:        You know, one day, honest citizens are gonna stand up to you
                 crooked cops!
   Chief Wiggum: [suddenly afraid] They are?  Oh, no!  Have they set a date?
   -- ``''
   
 The President's Day Pageant begins.  At the refreshment stand,
 Principal Skinner instructs Groundskeeper Willie to water down the
 orange drink some more, in order to recoup their losses from `Fire
 Drill Follies'.
   
   Good evening, everyone, and welcome to a wonderful evening of theater
   and &lt;picking up after yourselves&gt;.
   -- Principal Skinner's warm welcome (hint hint), ``''
   
 The show begins with a parade of the lesser-known presidents.
   
   We are the mediocre presidents.
   You won't find our faces on dollars or on cents!
   There's Taylor, there's Tyler, there's Fillmore and there's Hayes.
   There's William Henry Harrison, ``I died in thirty days!''
   We... are... the... adequate, forgettable, occasionally regrettable
   Caretaker presidents of the U-S-A!
   -- President's Day Pageant, ``''
   
 Bart's bare-bottom rendition of Richard ``I am not a butt'' Nixon
 draws the intended response.
   
   Bart, do you want to play John Wilkes Booth, or do you want to act
   like a maniac?
   -- Miss Hoover gives Bart a scolding, ``''
   
 Lisa tries to apologize to Ralph, who answers, ``Leave me alone.
 I'm here to play George Washington.''  Ralph takes the costume for
 the wrong president.
   
   You have one line, and then you're shot.
   -- Miss Hoover coaches Milhouse on his r\^ole as Abraham Lincoln,
      ``''
   
 Milhouse (as Lincoln) settles down to a nice evening at Ford's Theater.
 ``Oh no! John Wilkes Booth!''  Bart wears shades and wields a ping-pong
 ball gun.
   
   Hasta la vista, Abey.
   -- Bart Simpson plays John Wilkes Booth (the Assassinator), ``''
   
 A struggle ensues.
   
   C'mon, boy!  Finish him off!
   -- Homer roots for John Wilkes Booth, ``''
   
 Bart goes after Chester A. Arthur before he is yanked off the stage
 by Miss Hoover.  (``Unhand me, Yankee!'')
   
   Principal Skinner: And now, our evening comes to an end...
   Homer:             [stands up] Woo-hoo!
   Principal Skinner: ... with a thorough re-telling of the life of
                      George Washington.
   Homer:             [o.s.] D'oh!
   -- ``''
   
 The curtain rises.  Lisa addresses Ralph, who is bent over the
 fireplace.  He sadly discards the Valentine's Day Card into the
 burning (!) fire and gives the performance of his life.
   
   Kerny: To the library!
   Jimbo: Yeah!
   -- ``''
   
 The moving death scene concludes, and the show wraps up with a
 singing Mount Rushmore.  (I am not making this up.)  Principal
 Skinner encourages the audience to buy some orange drink on their
 way out.

 Ralph (still in costume) signs autographs, then spots Lisa on the
 swings.  He joins her, and she gives him a ``Let's be friends'' card.
 Chief Wiggum observes the scene from his patrol car.
   
   Attention all units!  Riot in progress at (*click*)
   -- Chief Wiggum turns a deaf ear, ``''
   
 He switches the radio to the Bill and Marty Show (do those guys ever
 sleep?).  As Ralph and Lisa play on the swings, Marty accidentally
 plays ``Monster Mash''.

 [End of Act Three.  Time: 20:28]

 ``Monster Mash'' continues over the credits.

 United States Presidents


The section presented for the benefit of non-US viewers and US viewers
who didn't pay attention in history class.

 President's Day


Once upon a time, the birthdays of presidents George Washington (22
February) and Abraham Lincoln (12 February) were celebrated as
independent holidays.  Both were phenomenally insignificant holidays,
which nearly all companies didn't even deign to offer as paid
holidays, with the exceptions of government agencies and banks,
continuing the unwritten rule that government agencies and banks must
observe every holiday, no matter how minor, so as to cause maximal
discomfort to everyone else.  Springfield Nuclear Power Plant also
observed both holidays.  (See episode [7F01].)

In the 1970's [I believe; Jym Dyer will no doubt correct me --rjc],
when the federal government realized that these were two holidays that
nobody cared about, the separate holidays were combined into a single
holiday that nobody cared about, with the generic name ``President's
Day'', celebrated on some random day in mid-February.

 Selected presidents


Ralph took the costume for Franklin Delano Roosevelt rather than
George Washington.  FDR was confined to a wheelchair for most of his
life, owing to polio.  The fact was, however, hidden from the public
for much of his tenure.  (Roosevelt would occasionally be seen
standing, but he was always standing behind a lectern or otherwise
carefully positioned so that he'd have something to lean against.)

 Lisa's valentine


Jim Dyer @{jd} recognizes Lisa's valentine from the ``Thomas the
Tank Engine'' valentine pack.  There's another card in the pack that
seems custom-made for Ralph:
\C
	Happy Valentine's Day, FRIEND!
\eC
The last word is very large, and in all caps.  Guess Lisa was
asleep at the switch when she cho-cho-chose the card to give
to Ralph.

 President Clinton's appearance


The newspaper ``USA Today'' (6 Nov 1992, Page D-1) reported that
President Clinton would appear on an episode in February dealing with
Krusty's campaign for higher office in Springfield.  They were close.
(This episode originally aired on 11 February 1993.)

 Miscellaneous


Lisa walks home, although she takes the school bus, which explains how
Bart got home before she did.  (Bart must have taken the bus.)  But why
was she walking home in the first place?

Ther was no chocolate stain on Lisa's dress as she yells,
``Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!''  Maybe they &lt;do&gt; come
out?

 Boring distribution restrictions


Blah blah blah blah.

CNN Headline News had a brief story on American programs being
exported to foreign (oops, ``international'') markets.  Brief
clips were shown of ``Krusty Gets Busted'' dubbed in French.

When asked to explain the success of ``The Simpsons'' in Turkey...

    I think ``The Simpsons'' would be popular in any country where fathers
    are screaming and strangling their kids. -- Matt Groening

 EPISODE TITLE: Duffless


EPISODE SUMMARY:  {bjr} {dh} {jt}

[Syndication cuts and timings are marked in curly braces {} and come
thanks to the good people at Frederic Briere.  Well, actually, only
one person.]

It's science fair time again!  Principal Skinner seems pleased with
this year's crop of exhibits.

For a school with no Asian kids I think we put on a pretty darn good
science fair.
-- Principal Skinner, 

Skinner happens upon Bart's science project, a "Go-Go" Ray.  Bart
demonstrates, and fires the ray, which is set on Mashed Potato, at
Skinner.  Sure enough, he uncontrollably begins doing the Mashed
Potato.  He sets the beam to "The Monkey" and zaps Ms. Krabappel.
"Can't... stop... doing... the monkey!"

I'm disrupting the learning process, and I love it!
-- Skinner loves Bart's "Go-Go Ray", 

Skinner awards him first prize... first prize... first prize...
The scene fades to reveal Bart is still in bed.

Lisa: [echoic from Bart's dream] First prize! First prize! First prize!
Bart: Why are you saying that?
Lisa: Just screwing with your mind.  [Laughs and runs off]
-- Sibling rivalry, 

Meanwhile, Homer and Marge prepare for another busy day.

Marge: [making up a batch of pancakes] Homer, I want you to encourage
       Lisa with her science fair project.
Homer: [pouring syrup on a newly minted stack of pancakes] Yeah, syrup
       is better than jelly.
-- Homer's own science project, 

Lisa: [showing off a tomato the size of a beach ball] I've grown a
      futuristic tomato by fertilizing it with anabolic steroids.
Bart: The kind that help our Olympic athletes reach new peaks of
      excellence?
Lisa: The very same.
-- 

Lisa imagines a 3rd world family cutting up and giving out slices
of tomatoes freely, with a shrine devoted to Lisa.  Bart's science
project investigates the effects of smoking on dogs, but Marge
doesn't like the idea.

	Homer: Well, time to go to work.
Homer's brain: Little do they know I'm ducking out early to take the
	       Duff Brewery tour.
	Homer: Roll in at nine, punch out at five, that's the plan.
Homer's brain: Heh, heh, heh.  They don't suspect a thing.
		[camera pans down to Homer's mouth, but he doesn't say
                 anything]
	       Well, off to the plant.
	Homer: Then to the Duff Brewery.
Homer's brain: Uh, oh.  Did I say that or just think it?
	Homer: [panicky] I've got to think of a lie fast!
	Marge: Homer, are you going to the Duff Brewery?
	Homer: Aah! [Runs off]
-- Brain before mouth?, 

Homer rolls into the plant at nine.  The employees file cattle-like
through the entrance.  When one hapless worker bends down to tie his
shoe, the guard encourages him to move on with a well-aimed kick to
the rear.  Homer reads a tattered map: "If the plant ye wish to flee,
go sector 7-B." Homer ducks through the door to sector 7-B.  On the
other side is a long, dark tunnel with many pipes running along the
ceiling.  Moving intrepidly down the tunnel, Homer is started when he
bumps into a skeleton.  Before he has much time to contemplate what
fate befell that guy, a huge purple spider appears.  Homer consults
his map: "To remove the spider's curse, simply quote a Bible verse."
But he is stuck at "Thou shalt not..." and simply throws a rock at
it, knocking it out, and leaps out the window.  Outside the plant,
Barney waits for Homer in his car.  There is a mattress tied to the
roof, presumably to cushion Homer's fall.

Hey!  That looks like Princess Di.
 [drives forward a few feet. Homer slams into the ground just behind
  the car]
Aw, wait, it's just a pile of rags.
-- Barney, 

Class at Springfield Elementary lets out for the day.  Lisa is still
hauling around the tomato.

   Lisa: Oh Bart, I forgot my math book.  Could you hold this for me,
	 please?
   Bart: [Curly-esque] Why, sointantly!  Nyuk, nyuk, nyuk.
	  [takes the tomato from Lisa]
Skinner: [walks past Bart, then stops]  Whoops!  Shoe's untied.
	  [bends over to tie it]
	 Over, under, in and out, that's what shoe tying's all about.
-- 

Bart resists temptation -- for maybe two seconds.  Then he hurls the
tomato at Skinner.  He looks up from his shoe-tying to see the tomato
making a beeline for his bottom.  The scene goes into slow-motion as
Skinner yells "Noooooooooooooooooo!".  The tomato hits its target,
splattering free goo all over everyone.  Everyone laughs, except for
a certain student who removes with her math book.  "BAAAART!"

Homer and Barney make it to the Duff Brewery.  An automaton of a
couch potato whirls out of the Duff Brewery clock and burps three
times.  A tour guide greets Homer, Barney and other tourists.

   Guide: Welcome to the Duff Brewery.  Well, I'm sure that all of you
	  have heard the rumors that a batch of Duff was contaminated
	  with strychnine.
Tourists: No.  Strychnine?  That's news to me.
   Guide: Are you sure?  Everyone's talking about it; it was even on
	  CNN last night.
Tourists: CNN?  Whoah.
   Guide: [dismissing] Well, it's not true.
-- Take my word for it, 

The tourists walk inside and pass {a sign depicting the Prohibition
era and} a sign from the McCarthy era.

A Duff Beer commercial from the 1950's shows a cartoon doctor
pointing at a crude diagram of a stomach.

   Doctor: Only Duff fills your "Q zone" with pure beer goodness.
	    [the letters G-O-O-D-N-E-S-S tumble down into the
           "stomach."]
	    [the commercial cuts to a shot of the doctor]
	   So drink up -- and up -- and up!
	   [the cartoon doctor literally takes off, like a rocket]
Announcer: Duff Brewery -- proud sponsors of Amos and Andy!
-- A Duff Beer commercial from the 1950's, 

Another early Duff Beer commercial depicts the Kennedy-Nixon
Presidential debate of 1960.

    Nixon: Well I would suggest, Mr. Vancouver, that if you knew the
	   President that, that was just a facetious remark.
Announcer: And now a word from our sponsor.
  Kennedy: I would like to take this opportunity to announce my
	   fondness for, ah, Duff Beer.  [audience cheers]
    Nixon: I'd also like to express, er, my fondness for that
	   particular beer.
	    [audience grumbles]
-- A Duff Beer commercial from 1960, 

The man never drank a Duff in his life.
-- Homer watches the Duff Beer commercial from 1960 featuring Nixon,
     

The tour group visits the room where beer is stored.

Here we have, Duff, Duff Light, and our newest flavor, Duff Dry.
 [camera pulls back to reveal that all three vats are fed by a common
  pipe]
-- The Duff Brewery tour guide, 

Guide: What does the future hold for us?  Heh.  Let's just say we have
       a few ideas up our sleeve.
Homer: Like what?
Guide: Um, I'd rather not get into it right now.
Homer: Why not?
Guide: All right, we don't have any ideas for the future.  We got
       nothing.  Happy?
Homer: [whiny] No.
-- So much for innovation, 

Meanwhile, at the Simpson household, Marge tries to comfort her
daughter.  Lisa bemoans her fate, crying that the science fair is in
three days.  Marge suggests running a hamster through a maze.  Lisa
imagines a hamster doing just that.  The hamster's head is replaced
with that of Bart, and the hybrid creature promptly gets stuck,
crying, "Help me!  Help meee!"  Lisa laughs wickedly

 Lisa: [laughs wickedly]
Marge: What's so funny?
 Lisa: Oh, uh ... I was just thinking of a joke I saw on Herman's Head.
	[laughs nervously]
-- A _funny_ joke?, 

The Duff Brewery tour rolls on.  The next stop is the quality control
department.  The guide introduces the quality control man, Phil, who
analyzes several cans of Duff on a conveyour belt.  Barney tells Phil
that he's doing a great job and Phil thanks him while some less-than-
wonderful bottles of Duff go by.

The tour concludes in a beer tasting room, complete with the
old-fashioned wooden casks.

 Homer: {Mmmmm, Gummi Beers.} [eats one]  Hey, Barney, I think you've
	had enough.
Barney: [lying on a bench under one of the beer taps] Are you crazy?
	We still haven't tried Raspberry Duff, Lady Duff, Tartar
	Control Duff, ohhh.
	 [passes out]
-- Mmmm, toothpastey beer, 

Homer and Barney leave the brewery.  On the way out, they pass one of
those signs that can periodically rotate to display more than one
message.  The first message on the sign warns against the perils of
drinking and driving.  The second message depicts two men in front of
a car, with the slogan, "It's always time for Duff."

 Homer: Barney, give me your keys.  You're too drunk to drive.
Barney: I'm fine.
 Homer: OK, you leave me no option.  [punches Barney]
Barney: Ow!  What was that for?
 Homer: I'm trying to knock you out.
	 [tries a little harder -- with a tire iron]
Barney: Ow!  Cut it out.
	 [Homer tries slamming Barney's head in the car door]
	Ow! [slam] Ow! [slam] Ow! [slam] Ow! [slam] Ow!
	All right, here, take the keys.  [hands Homer the keys]
-- A head of stone, 

Homer and Barney drive out of the brewery parking lot.  On the way
out, they pass a mascot dressed as a giant beer stein.  It turns out
that the mascot is actually Chief Wiggum on a stake-out.  He talks
into his wallet, I mean, radio: "Look alive, boys -- a couple of
stewed prunes heading your way."

A phalanx of motorcycle cops peels out from behind a billboard.
Homer sees them, and pulls over.

 Homer:  [standing on one foot and singing "The Alphabet Song"]
	W, X, Y, and Z.  Now I know my ABCs, won't you come and play
	with me.
 Eddie: Flawless.
   Lou: We also would have accepted, "tell me what you think of me."
 Eddie: Well, I guess your free to...
Barney: Give him the breathalyzer!
 Homer: Huh?
	 [Eddie sticks it in Homer's mouth.  It beeps]
   Lou: You're under arrest!
 Homer: D'oh!
-- What if that thing's broken...?, 

Wiggum, still in the stein suit, lets Barney drive home. "Think you
can get this car home?" "Sure thing, giant beer."  Barney backs
the car into Wiggum, and he falls down an incline, rolling into a
hill.  He screams, but then settles down. "This is kinda fun!"  He
"whee"s excitedly... until the stein explodes when it hits a tree.

[End of Act One.  Time: 7'42" {7'34"}]

Marge gets a surprise phone call at home.

 Marge: Hello?
Wiggum: Uh, Mrs. Simpson, I have some bad news.  Your husband was found
	DOA.
 Marge: Oh, my God!  He's dead?
Wiggum: Oh, wait.  I mean DWI.  Heh, heh, heh.  I always get those two
	mixed up.  [hangs up phone]
	 [at that moment, a lady arrives at the police station]
 Woman: My name's Mrs. Phillips.  You said my husband's DWI.
Wiggum: [stalling] Uhhhh, why don't you talk to that officer over
	there.  I'm going out to lunch.
-- Bad cops, bad cops, 

In the Springfield jail, crack attorney Lionel Hutz lays out his plan
to spring Homer.

       [to Homer, in jail]
Hutz: Don't worry, Homer, I've got a foolproof strategy to get you out
      of here -- surprise witnesses, each more surprising than the
      last.  I tell you, the judge won't know what hit him.
       [camera pulls back to reveal Hutz is in the cell next to Homer]
 Cop: [bangs bars with nightstick] Pipe down in there, Hutz.
-- Couldn't we go for in forma pauperis?, 

Homer has his day in court.

Judge: Your license is hereby revoked, and I'd like you to attend
       traffic school and two months of Alc-Anon meetings.
Homer: Your honor, I'd like that stricken from the record.
Judge: No.
-- Speedy trials, 

Lisa attempts to procure a subject for her new experiment at the pet
store.

 Lisa: I want the most intelligent hamster you've got.
Clerk: OK.
	[reaches into a box of hamsters under the counter and randomly
       selects one]
       Uh, this little guy writes mysteries under the name of J. D.
       McGregor.
 Lisa: How can a hamster write mysteries?
Clerk: Well, he gets the ending first, then he writes backward.
 Lisa: Aw, C'mon.
Clerk: Look, kid, just take him before his mother eats him, all right?
-- Lisa gets a hamster for her project, 

The next morning, Homer goes off to work.  Despite his lack of a
valid driver's license, we see him at the wheel of his car.  Marge
tells him to have a good day, and Homer goes off... on Lisa's bike.
Nelson passes by, popping a wheelie and laughing in his face.  Homer
bemoans his fate, but discovers a little ringing bell and enjoys it.

The great experiment begins.

Lisa: [writing] I propose to determine the answer to the question:
      is my brother dumber than a hamster?
Bart: Hey Lis, look what I can do!
       [inserts fist into mouth, but discovers he can't retract it]
      Mmmph -- doggone it.
-- Are you sure you don't already know?, 

The first test explores the subject's ability to acquire food.  In a
miniature room filled with dollhouse furniture, Lisa places a hamster
food pellet on top of a bookcase.  The hamster notices it's out of
reach, and drags a couch over.  Then he climbs on it and retrieves
the pellet. "Remarkable," Lisa observes.  Now we repeat the
experiment with Bart.  In this case, a cupcake is set on the top
shelf of the bookcase.  (An actual bookcase, silly, not the dollhouse
one.)  Bart, on his daily rounds, walks by.

Stupid books -- hey, a cupcake!
-- Bart passes by the bookcase, 

Bart attempts to climb the bookcase to get it, but the plan fails.
The bookcase topples over, pinning Bart.  Maggie walks by and, without
breaking stride, picks up the cupcake.  Lisa notes with glee,
"Hamster 1, Bart 0."

Cut to the next experiment, which Lisa is about to explain for us.
The food is connected to a mild electrical current.  The hamster
tries to eat the food, but is promptly zapped.  He reels back in fear.

The hamster has learned a valuable lesson:  beware the hand of man.
-- Lisa's science project, 

Bart's turn again.  A cupcake is connected to the mild electrical
current.  There's even a sign that says, "Do not touch."  Bart
sees the cupcake.  Bart sees the sign.  He tosses it aside and goes
for the cupcake.  He gets shocked.  Imitating Moe (not the bartender)
"Wiseguy, eh?".  He tries again, and slaps himself like Curly.  He
tries once more.  "Ow." Again. "Ow." Again. "Ow."  Lisa once again
takes score.  "Hamster 2, Bart 0"

Homer attends traffic school.  Chief Wiggum prepares to show a
gruesome film.

Wiggum: Now if any of you ever think of drinking and driving again,
	this film will scare the pants off of you.
	{[shows movie, but it's of Wiggum in Speedos, in a kiddie pool]}
 Woman: {Aaah!}
Wiggum: {Guys, guys, this is the wrong movie.}
-- 

{"Oh, wait a second, I do something really funny here."  The film
shows him soaking his wife with a hose.  She doesn't seem to think
it's really funny. Neither does anyone else in the audience.}

{Wiggum laughs, but groans when he notices no one agrees with him.}
Eventually, they get the correct film threaded up.  The camera pans
from a recent accident scene to Troy McClure.

[downcast] What a terrible waste.  [perks up] Hi!  I'm Troy McClure.
You might remember me from such driver's ed films as "Alice's
Adventures through the Windshield Glass" and "The Decapitation of Larry
Leadfoot."  For the next sixty minutes, we'll be seeing actual film of
car crash victims.
-- Troy McClure introduces himself, 

The footage is shown.  Everyone in the audience seems horrified (one
guy almost loses his lunch) except Homer.

Here's an appealing fellow -- in fact, they're a-peeling him off the
sidewalk.
-- McClure narrates a driver's ed film, 

It's funny 'cause I don't know him.
-- Homer watches footage of actual car crash victims, 

Homer arrives for his court-ordered Alc-Anon meeting.

  Homer: I'm here for the Alc-Anon meeting.
Lovejoy: Mm-hm.  Third door on your left.
	  [Jasper walks up]
	 Coping with senility?
 Jasper: [gruff] No.  I'm here for Microwave Cookery.  No, wait.
	 Coping with senility.
-- At the Community Center, 

Ned Flanders is the first to speak at the meeting.

  Ned: My name is Ned.
  All: Hello, Ned!
  Ned: It's been 4,000 days since my last drink.  It was my first --
       and last -- blackberry schnapps.
	[flashback of Ned and Maude in bed]
Maude: Ned, did you clip Ann Landers today?
  Ned: [climbing into bed] Ann Landers is a boring old biddy!
Maude: [gasps] Ned!
	[back to reality (BTR)]
  Ned: [sobbing] I was more animal than man!
-- Ned Flanders at the Alc-Anon, 

My name is Otto, I looove to get blotto.
-- Otto introduces himself at the Alc-Anon meeting, 

My name is Hans.  Drinking has ruined my life.  I'm 31 years old!
-- Hans Moleman introduces himself at the Alc-Anon meeting,
    

My name is Homer, and I'm just here because the courts made me come.
-- Homer introduces himself at the Alc-Anon meeting, 

Lovejoy: Homer, with our help, you'll never touch a beer again.
  Homer: Aaah!  [jumps out the window]
-- The Alc-Anon meeting, 

Homer and Marge prepare to retire for the evening.

Homer: ...so they say I might have a problem.
	[finishes brushing his teeth, and polishes off a bottle of that
       wonderful Duff]
Marge: [reading from a pamphlet entitled, "Is Your Spouse a Souse?"]
       Homey, do you ever drink alone?
Homer: Does the Lord count as a person?
Marge: No.
Homer: Then yes.
Marge: Do you need a beer to fall asleep?
Homer: Thank you, that'd be nice.
Marge: Do you ever hide beer around the house?
Homer: Do I ever!
	[fetches a beer from its hiding place in the toilet tank, and
       takes a swig] Ahhhh.
Marge: Do you ever drink to escape from reality.
Homer: [looks in the mirror and imagines himself as a big muscular guy]
	[to "Can-Can"] Duhh, duh duh duh duh duuh duuh, duh duh duh duh
       duuh duuh, duh duh duh duh duh, duh duh duh duh...
Marge: Homey, I'd like you to do something for me.
Homer: You name it.
Marge: I want you to give up beer for a month.
Homer: You got it.  No deer for a month.
Marge: Did you say beer, or deer?
Homer: .... Deer.
Marge: Please, Homey, I know you can do this.
Homer: All right, starting tomorrow no beer for a month.
	[puts the light out.  We can hear the sound of a can popping
       open]
Marge: What was that noise?
Homer: I was saying, "Psssst, I love you."

[End of Act Two.  Time: 13'53" {13'25"}]

Marge asks Bart to get the cupcakes.  Agitated and his eyes
dysfunctional, Bart says "Cupcakes, cupcakes; yes, sweet cakes for
all!", and enters the kitchen.  Eerie music plays as Bart slowly
reaches for them, then drops to the floor and shudders in a fetal
position.  Homer, not noticing, gets a six-pack of beer and pours it
down the drain.

Homer: Well beer, we've had some great times...
	[singing to "It was a Very Good Year"]
	When I was 17,
	I drank some very good beer.
	I drank some very good beer
	I purchased with a fake ID
	My name was Brian McGee
	I stayed up listening to Queen
	When I was 17.

The next day, Bart discovers Lisa's experiment journal on her desk
and leafs through it.  He is most displeased.  "I'm gonna crush her
like this pellet", he promises, but it proves more difficult than
he expected.

Later that day, Lisa goes to update her experiment journal, only to
notice that it is gone.

Lisa: [Frantically looks for it] Oh, oh!
Bart: Looking for something? [petting the hamster]
Lisa: What have you done with my report? [goes to look for it]
Bart: I've hidden it.  To find it, you'll need to decipher a series of
      clues, each more fiendish --
Lisa: [finds it] Got it!
Bart: D'oh!
-- Great plan, Bart, 

It's science fair time!  (For real.)  Springfield's student body
shows off the fruits of their scientific labor.

Milhouse: Behold gravity in all its glory!
	   [pushes a Slinky down an inclined 2-by-4.  It goes one step,
           then stops]
    Edna: Pretty lame, Milhouse.
-- Milhouse's science project, 

{Milhouse isn't the only kid having problems.}

Chuck: {Can I touch it?}
  Dad: {I've worked too long and hard on this for you to screw it up
       now.}
Chuck: {But it's got my name on it.}
  Dad: {Just stand over there!
	[kid walks off screen]
       Over there!}
-- You can't enjoy it on as many levels as I can, 

{Martin tries his hand at scientific enlightenment.}

Martin: {Behold the flying machine that will car me, Phineas Fogg,
	around the world in eighty days.}
Nelson: {[shoots Martin's balloon] Dang!  I was aiming for his head.}
-- Martin Prince's science project, 

Homer spots Ralph Wiggum's exhibit:  A little alcohol-fueled car
running on a circular track.  He's trying not to think about beer.
He imagines himself at a gasohol pump, alternately pumping gasohol
into his car and himself. "One for you, one for me.  One for you, one
for me." BTR, Homer gives one of his lusty "Ohhhh"s (with the drool
hanging out.)

At Lisa's exhibit....

Marge: I don't know if I like you experimenting on your brother.
 Lisa: Please, mother, its purely in the interests of science.
	[thinking] That'll learn him to bust my tomater.
-- Revenge is a dish best served cold a la gazpacho, 

Lisa's revenge is interrupted the hub-bub surrounding one of the
other exhibits.  She slips through the crowd to see the cause of all
the fuss.  It is Bart, wearing a circus barker costume and standing
in front of his exhibit.

Step right up, folks!  We'll answer the question that's been
plaguing scientists for ages:  Can hamsters fly planes?
-- Bart's science project, "The Simpsons"

Bart reveals Lisa's hamster in WW I aviator goggles and scarf,
sitting in a model plane.  The crowd "aww"s at its hideous cuteness.
Lisa protests. "But this project has no scientific merit!"  The crowd
tells her to take a hike.  "Sour grapes."

Every good scientist is half B. F. Skinner and half P. T.
Barnum.
-- Principal Skinner, on Bart's project, 

Without looking at any of the other exhibits, Skinner awards Bart's
project first prize.

Homer marks off his first alcohol-free day ("One down, 29 to go")
and watches a little TV.  Unfortunately, it's one of the omnipresent
Duff ads.  This one features a group of women leading an anti-sexism
protest.  A pair of beer delivery men look on, bemused.

   Women: Down with sexism!  Down with sexism!
   Man 1: Look at all those feminists.
   Man 2: Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
	   [they both reach for bottles of beer, shake them up, and
          spray the foam on the protesters.  This magically turns
          them into bikini-clad party animals.  (Kids, don't try that
          at home.)]
Both Men: Yeah!  Yes!  All right!
-- A Duff Beer commercial, 

TV, have you turned on me, too?
-- Homer, 

Homer tries to take his mind off his troubles at the ball park, where
he is the only person in the stands not drinking.

Announcer: ...the windup and a 2-2 pitch.  Oh, no, wait a minute, the
	   batter is calling for time.  Looks like he's going to get
	   himself a new bat.  And now there's a beach ball on the
	   field, and the balls boys are discussing which one of them's
	   going to go get it.
    Homer: [only one not drinking] I never realized how boring this
	   game is.
-- A rude awakening, 

At home, Homer marks his 15th dry day.  He notices he's lost weight.
{Later, Homer attends Patty and Selma's home utensil party.}

Patty: {Thank you all for coming.  We've got some very interesting new
       developments in the field of Supperware.}
Selma: {Uh, huh.  This is the 128-ounce tub.  You can fit your whole
       head in it. [demonstrates and looks at Jub-Jub]  Don't be scared
       Jub-jub; it's momma.}
Homer: {[sotto voce] I would kill everyone in this room for a drop of
       sweet beer.}
-- 

Homer attends another Alc-Anon meeting.

Lovejoy: So Homer, pleas feel free to tell us anything.  There's no
	 judgment here.
  Homer: The other day I was so desperate for a beer I snuck into the
	 football stadium and ate the dirt under the bleachers.
Lovejoy: I cast thee out!
-- You remember Matthew 21:17, 

Homer rides along on Lisa's bike, trying not to think about beer.
He sees a Duff billboard of a scantily clad woman next to a beer
bottle ("You know you want it") and Homer turns sharply to avoid
looking at it.  He stops at a railroad crossing, where he sees that
the train rolling past is carrying several boxcars' worth of Duff.
The wheels even seem to be saying "Chug-a-lug, chug-a-lug, chug-a-
lug"...  Homer turns away from the railroad and bikes straight into
an empty can of Duff which sends him off his bike looking skyward.
A zeppelin flies overhead, with a marquee reading "Surrender to Duff"
and releases a payload of Duff Bottles. "Nooo!!!!"

Despite all of that, he makes it.  Shuddering, Homer crosses off the
last day of the month.

Homer: Thirty days.
Marge: I'm proud of you, Homey.
Homer: Marge, I'm going to Moe's.  Send the kids to the neighbors, I'm
       coming back loaded.  [kisses Marge good-bye]
-- 

Marge: Mmmm.  You don't have to start drinking right away.  I waas
       thinking we could go for a bike ride.
Homer: But Marge, the barflies are expecting me.  Larry, and Barney,
       and that guy who calls me Bill.
Marge: But you look better, you don't sweat when you eat any more, and
       look -- [holds up a wad of cash] you've saved more than a
       hundred dollars.  I found it in your pants.
Homer: [snatches money] Yoink!
Marge: Mmmm.
-- 

Homer arrives at Moe's.

     Moe: Well, well.  Look who it is, Mr. "I Don't Need Alky-hol to
	  Enjoy Life."  We hate him, right fellas?
Barflies: [grumble]
   Homer: Moe, give me a beer.
     Moe: Hey everybody, Homer's back.
Barflies: [grumbles]
-- Who cares?, 

Moe pours Homer a glass of that wonderful Duff.  Homer lifts it to
his lips, but hesitates to drink it.  He eyes the poor, pathetic
barflies around him: Larry, Smitty (collapsed), and Barney (who
burps).  Then he looks at Moe.

   Moe: C'mon, Homer, do it for your old pal Moesy.
Barney: But Moe, yesterday you called Homer a worthless sack of --
   Moe: [strikes Barney] Pipe down, rub-a-dub!
-- Moe pushes Homer to get back to alkyholism, 

 Homer: [setting the glass on the bar] Put it in the fridge Moe, I got
	a date with my wife.
   Moe: You'll be back!  [points at various customers] And so will you.
	And you.  [points at camera] And you.
	 [he points at Barney]
Barney: Of course I'll be back.  If you didn't close, I'd never leave.
-- Moe fails to get Homer back to alkyholism, 

Homer and Marge go on that bike ride, after all.  They sing along to
"Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head" as they bike into the sunset.

[End of Act Three.  Time: 21'11" {19'55"}]

Instead of the usual closing theme music, "Raindrops Keep Falling on
My Head" (as sung by Kipp Lennon) keeps playing.

      (instrumental continues for ~10 seconds)
     
     It won't be long before happiness steps up to greet me
       . . .
     Raindrops keep falling on my head
     But that doesn't mean my eyes will soon be turning red
     Crying's not for me, 'cause
     I'm never gonna stop the rain by complaining
     Because I'm free, nothing's worrying me.

The sound effect for the Gracie Films logo is replaced by a bicycle
bell being rung twice, followed by Homer giggling.

 EPISODE TITLE: Last Exit to Springfield


EPISODE SUMMARY: 

   

 McBain proclaims ``Ice to see you'' as he bursts out of a much-too-small
 Venus de Milo ice sculpture.
 This time, Senator Mendoza gets the upper hand.  Bart
 comments, ``That is one evil dude,'' and Homer replies, ``That's
 just a movie, son.  There's nobody that evil in &lt;real&gt; life.''  Cut
 to Monty Burns, laughing with equal maniacal glee at the window
 washer outside his window whose scaffold has broken.  Monty closes
 the shutters, and we hear a falling scream.  Burns waits impatiently
 for the union representative.  Smithers notes that he hasn't been
 seen since he promised to clean up the union.  Meanwhile, a football
 player's progress is impeded by a human-shaped patch of dirt in the
 pitch.  Burns reads the proposed contract.
   
   Benefits?  Perqs?  A green cookie on Saint Patrick's Day?
   -- Monty Burns reads the proposed union contract, ``''
   
 Burns flashes back to simpler days.  Springfield, 1909, back when
 people smashed atoms by hand.  Grandfather Burns catches one of his
 employees trying to steal some atoms and has him taken away.
   
   You can't treat the working man this way.  One day, we'll form a union
   and get the fair and equitable treatment we deserve!  Then we'll go
   too far, and get corrupt and shiftless, and the Japanese will eat us alive!
   -- The beginning of the end, ``''
   
 Modern-day Burns considers the missed lessons of the past.
   
   If only we'd listened to that boy, instead of walling him up in the
   abandoned coke oven.
   -- Monty Burns, ``''
   
 Determined to claim some sort of victory over the unions, Burns
 picks a line at random from the contract to strike out.  He
 selects the company dental plan.

 At ``Painless Dentistry'', the solitary lamp turns Ralph's exam into
 an interrogation.  When he admits that he doesn't brush his teeth,
 Ralph is shown ``The Big Book of of [sic] British Smiles'', depicting
 assorted Brits with crooked teeth.  The picture of Prince Charles
 pushes Ralph over the edge.  Meanwhile, Bart entertains the
 impressionable youngsters in the waiting room.
   
   Bart:  Dr. Wolfe likes to pull kids' teeth so he can sell 'em.
   Kid:   To who?
   Bart:  Know that rattle when you shake up a can of spray paint?
          That's a kid's teeth!
   -- ``''
   
 Dr. Wolfe inspects Maggie's mouth.
   
   Dr. Wolfe: Maggie's teeth are coming in rather crooked.
              Has she been sucking on a pacifier?
   Marge:     Errrrrmmmmm...  Not to my knowledge.
   -- ``''
   
 The good dentist immediately shouts, ``Liar!''

 Marge and the kids await the dentist's verdict.
   
   Dr. Wolfe: I'm also afraid little Lisa is going to need braces.
   Lisa:      Oh no!  I'll be socially unpopular! ... More so!
   -- ``''
   
 With the aid of modern computer imaging, the dentist shows how
 grossly disfigured Lisa's face would become if her dental anomaly
 were to go unchecked.
 Bart wants to take financial advantage of this by exhibiting
 her as a freak in the South.

 Homer's television viewing of pro wrestling is interrupted by
 Marge's announcement that Lisa will need braces.  ``Don't worry.  We
 won a dental plan in the strike of '88.  That's where I got this
 scar.''  Flashback to said strike.
   
   Carl: What do we want?
   All:  More equitable treatment at the hands of management!
   Carl: When do we want it?
   All:  Soon!
   -- ``''
   
 Homer got his scar when the awning of a snack bar slammed down on
 his head while he screamed, ``I want a burrito!  I want a burrito!''
   
   Then I got &lt;this&gt; scar sneaking under the door of a pay toilet.
   -- Homer, ``''
   
 At a meeting of the International Brotherhood of Jazz Dancers,
 Pastry Chefs, and Nuclear Technicians...
   
   Carl: Welcome, brothers of Local 643.  As you know, our president,
         Chuckie Fitzhugh, ain't been seen lately.  We're all prayin' he'll
         turn up soon, alive and well.
   All:  [laugh]
   Carl: All right, all right.  But seriously.
   -- ``''
   
 The latest contract proposal gives them a free keg of beer for their
 meeting ('Ray!) in exchange for giving up their dental plan.  All
 rush for the keg.
   
   Lenny: So long, dental plan!
   Homer: [thinks...]
   Lenny's voice: Dental plan!
   Marge's voice: Lisa needs braces.
   Lenny's voice: Dental plan!
   Marge's voice: Lisa needs braces.
   Lenny's voice: Dental plan!
   Marge's voice: Lisa needs braces.
   Lenny's voice: Dental plan!
   Marge's voice: Lisa needs braces.
   Lenny's voice: Dental plan!
   Marge's voice: Lisa needs braces.
   Lenny's voice: Dental plan!
   Marge's voice: Lisa needs braces.
   Chuckie: [as a prank, drops a pencil into the crack of Homer's butt]
   Carla: Bull's-eye!
   Homer: Thanks a lot, Carl.  Now I lost my train of throught.
   Lenny's voice: Dental plan!
   Marge's voice: Lisa needs braces.
   Lenny's voice: Dental plan!
   Marge's voice: Lisa needs braces.
   Homer: If we give up our dental plan... ... ...
          I'll have to pay for Lisa's braces!
   -- Surely but slowly, ``''
   
 Homer tells everyone they can't give up their dental plan.  He
 points out that without it, Lenny wouldn't have the diamond in his
 tooth.  (Which is promptly stolen.)  ``You know what I think of this
 contract?  This!''  Homer tries to tear it in half, but it's so
 thick, he's reduced to tearing the sheets off one at a time.  The
 handle of the keg-o'-Duff turns... revealing a secretly mounted
 camera.  Burns and Smithers watch on the monitor.
   
   Burns:    Who is that firebrand, Smithers?
   Smithers: That's Homer Simpson.
   Burns:    Simpson, eh?  New man?
   Smithers: [brief chuckle]  He thwarted your campaign for governor,
             you ran over his son, he saved the plant from meltdown,
             his wife painted you in the nude...
   Burns:    Doesn't ring a bell.
   -- I'd remember if Marge was nude while painting me...
      ``''
   
 Carla proposes that Homer be their new president.  ``All in favor?''
 ``Aye!''  ``All opposed?''  A solitary meek voice votes, ``Nay.''
 Homer is elected.
   
   Homer: Hey, what does this job pay?
   Carl:  Nuthin'.
   Homer: D'oh!
   Carl:  Unless you're crooked.
   Homer: Woo-hoo!
   -- U-S-A!  U-S-A!  ``''
   
 [End of Act One.  Time: 7:23]
   
   Lisa:  This is your chance to get a fair shake for the working man.
   Homer: &lt;And&gt; make life-long connections to the world of organized crime.
          Mmmmm... organized crime.
   -- ``''
   
 Don Homer is the master of his domain in Little Italy.

 Whether the dental plan will be reinstated depends on whether Homer
 or Mr. Burns is the better negitiator.  Homer accepts Bart's offer
 to trade a delicious doorstop for his crummy ol' danish.
   
   Lisa and Marge, these braces are invisible, painless, and periodically
   release a delightful burst of Calvin Klein's Obsession... for Teeth.
   -- Dr. Wolfe, ``''
   
 When Marge reveals that they don't have a dental plan...
   
   These predate stainless steel, so you can't get them wet.
   -- Dr. Wolfe shows Lisa a more affordable set of braces,
      ``''
   
 From his monitoring vantage point, Monty Burns admires Homer
 exercising at his station.

 From our vantage point, we see that Homer is twisting his body in an
 attempt to reach a Sugar Daddy stuck to his back.  Lenny peels it
 off for him.  ``But it's the last time!''  Homer takes the Sugar
 Daddy and sucks on it.

 Homer and Burns chat.
   
   Burns: We don't have to be adversaries, Homer.
          We both want a fair union contract.
   Homer: [thinking]  Why is Mr. Burns being so nice to me?
   Burns: And if you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours.
   Homer: [thinking]  Wait a minute.  Is he coming onto me?
   Burns: I mean, if I should slip something into your pocket, what's the harm?
   Homer: [thinking]  My God!  He &lt;is&gt; coming onto me!
   Burns: After all, negotiations make strange bedfellows.
          [chuckle]  [wink]
   Homer: [thinking] Aaaaaagh!
          [aloud]
          Sorry, Mr. Burns, but I don't go in for these backdoor shenanigans.
          Sure, I'm flattered, maybe even a little curious,
          but the answer is no!
   -- Wink wink, nudge nudge, ``''
   
 To assuage Lisa's fears, Dr. Wolfe shows her some of the tools he'll
 be using.  ``This one is the gouger.''
 It doesn't seem to help.  Before chiseling some teeth out
 of Lisa's jawbone, he puts Lisa under anaesthesia gas...

 Lisa floats happily through the air above a myriad of truly bizarre
 landscapes straight out of ``Yellow Submarine'', except that the
 submarine is purple.  (Mmmm... purple.)
   
   Look, fellas.  It's Lisa in the sky.
   -- Ringo, ``''
   
 When Lisa wakes up, she immediately asks for the mirror.  Dr. Wolfe
 backs away in fear.  Lisa takes the mirror, giggles, then breaks out
 into a cackle.  Her grotesque shadow is cast on the wall.  Lisa
 smashes the mirror.

 Lisa comes home with her new braces.  Santa's Little Helper comes
 bounding into the room, but is scared away when Lisa flashes her
 metallic smile.
   
   Homer: [answering the door]  Who is it?
   Voice: Goons.
   Homer: Who?
   Voice: Hired goons.
   Homer: Hired goons?  [opens the door]
   Goons: [take Homer roughly away]
   -- ``''
   
 The goons take Homer to Stately Burns Mansion, where Monty waits for
 them in the aviary.  (The vulture perched nearby bears a striking
 resemblance.)  Monty shows Homer the world's largest television set
 (now showing:  The bumblebee guy).  A room with a thousand monkeys
 at a thousand typewriters.  (``It was the best of times, it was
 blurst of times.'')
   
   Burns: And this is my basement.
          [reveals a traditional unfinished basement,
          complete with ping-pong table]
   Homer: Gee, it's not as nice as the other rooms.
   Burns: Yes, I really should stop ending the tour with it.
   -- ``''
   
   Burns: Now, let's get down to business.
   Homer: [thinks] Oh, man.  I have to go to the bathroom.
          Why did I have all that beer and coffee and watermelon?
          [water drips in the background, Smithers pours a cup of coffee]
   Burns: Now Homer, I know what you're thinking.
          I want to take the pressure off.
          Now, it doesn't take a `whiz' to know that
          you're looking out for `Number One'.
          Well, listen to me, and you'll make a big splash very soon.
   -- ``''
   
   Homer: Which way to the bathroom?
   Burns: Oh, it's the twenty-third door on the left.
   -- ``''
   
 Homer reaches a looooong corridor, opening door after door, not
 finding a bathroom.  Homer eventually returns.  ``Find the bathroom
 all right?''  Homer stops.  ``Uhh....  Yeahhhhhhh.''

 Monty Burns literally drops Homer off in his private helicopter.
 Marge rushes out to greet him, but her hair is chopped off by the
 helicopter blades.  (I was waiting for that to happen.)  Monty's
 dramatic and threatening exit comes to a rapid halt when he falls
 out of the helicopter.  After being bandaged and placed in a
 stretcher slung from the helicopter, he resumes his diabolical
 laughter.  (His stretcher bounces into a nearby chimney as the
 copter leaves.)

 Homer wonders why he was elected union president, then realizes that
 all the coworkers have been making fun of him.  So he punches Lenny
 in the back of the head first thing in the morning.

 It's picture day at Springfield Elementary.  Lisa sits with an
 adorable bow in her ahir, but her mouth is glued shut.  The
 photographer cajoles her into smiling, but when she reveals her
 braces, he is taken aback.  ``There is no God!''  Lisa's face falls,
 and the picture is taken.

 Homer tells the union brothers that he's fed up, and they call for a
 strike.  Carl again runs the vote.  ``All in favor of a strike?''
 ``Aye!''  ``All opposed?''  Again, a solitary meek voice votes,
 ``Nay.''  At the back of the room are two men.  One meek and frail,
 the other solid and robust.  The meek one points at the stronger
 one.  ``It was him.  Let's get him, fellas'' The entire union
 membership beat up the strong guy.  The meek guy chuckles.

 [End of Act Two.  Time: 14:54]

 Lisa accompanies the striking employees with a song on her guitar.
 (What a talented girl.  Shame about the teeth.)  Burns tells
 Smithers to get some strikebreakers, ``The ones they had in the
 '30's.''  Grampa and his pals are called in.  ``We can't bust heads
 like we used to, but we have our ways.  One trick is to tell 'em
 stories that don't go anywhere.''  Grampa launches into a story that
 goes nowhere.  Onions on the belt were all the style.

 Burns is ready to hose down the rowdy strikers.  But when Smithers
 turns on the hose, the water pressure throws Burns about like a
 wayward rocket.

 Lisa concludes her song.  Lenny makes a request for ``Classical Gas'',
 which Lisa fills,
 further demonstrating her skill as a guitarist.

 Burns is convinced that he and Smithers can run the plant
 themselves.  And they do, in a phenomenally silly manner.  But
 things run awry when the robot workers turn against their employers.
   
   Tonight, on Smartline.  ``The Power plant strike.  Argle bargle, or fooforaw?''
   -- Kent Brockman, ``''
   
 Guests are Monty Burns, union leader Homer Simpson, and talk show
 mainstay, Dr. Joyce Brothers.
   
   I brought my own mike!
   -- Dr. Joyce Brothers appears on `Smartline', ``''
   
 When Kent mentions the word `dinosaur', Homer freaks out.
   
   Kent:  Um, my director is telling me not to talk to you any more.
   Homer: Woo-hoo!
   -- ``''
   
 Burns is permitted his requested opening tirade.  Burns threatens
 dire events in fifteen minutes.

 Burns and Smithers march down the corridors of power, past numerous
 security measures, eventually leading to a hidden control room.
 ``Oh, for God's sake!''  Burns realizes that they left the (dilapidated)
 back door
 open.  With a ``From hell's heart, I stab at thee!'' Burns pushes
 the button.  Power goes out all around town.  Normal, law-abiding
 citizens instantly turn to looting.  A moving electric billboard
 reads, ``Total blackout in Springfield.''  The strikers are not
 deterred.  Lisa leads them in song.

 On his balcony, Burns cups his ear.  What?  They're spirit is not
 broken?
   
   Look at them all, through the darkness I'm bringing.
   They're not sad at all.  They're actually singing!
   They sing without juicers.
   They sing without blenders.
   They sing without flunjers, capdabblers and smendlers!
   -- ``''
   
 Burns calls Homer to the negotiating table.  He gives in on the
 dental plan, on one condition:  That Homer resign as union
 president.  Homer celebrates, doing a Three Stooges.  Burns watches,
 perplexed.  ``Smithers, I'm beginning to think that Homer Simpsons
 is not the brilliant tactician I thought he was.''

 Power returns to Springfield.  Including the peep show district.
 And the fake vomit factory.

 Sitting in the dentist's chair, Lisa smiles a toothy grin.  The
 family are gathered around.  Marge is pleased.  ``You can hardly see
 the braces.''  Lisa responds, ``And that's the tooth!''  All laugh
 uproariously.  The dentist notices, ``Whoops.  I left the [laughing]
 gas on.''  He shuts it off.  And they keep on laughing.

 Reviews


Michael Neylon {mn}: Although slow at first, there were finally tons
of refs near the end.  A cute episode.

John R. Donald {jrd}:  Overall, a very good episode.

Ted Frank {thf}: A solid episode, though nothing spectacular.  The
return of Burns and Smithers was welcome, but the animation of them
wasn't the best.  Burns was also a bit out of character; is this the
first time Homer's gotten the best of him?

Yours truly @{rjc}: Yes!  Not a classic, but a fine episode
nonetheless.  A nice remembrance of gags from episodes past, like the
constant repetition of ``Dental plan / Lisa needs braces'' (compare
``Will you take us to Mount Splashmore?''), and the David Letterman
music (compare the incomparable ``Land of Chocolate'' scene).  Even
Yeardley's singing was tolerable this time.

 Gangster buried in a football field


There is a long-standing urban legend that the body of Teamsters boss 
Jimmy Hoffa is buried under the end zone of Giants Stadium in New Jersey.

 A thousand monkeys...


The saying goes that a thousand monkeys on a thousand typewriters will
eventually produce the works of William Shakespeare.  W. Robert Glover
@{wrg} makes the additional observation that Burns' monkeys couldn't
even come up with Shakespeare; they had to settle for (erroneous)
Dickens.

And didja notice that the monkey looked like a tired hack writer,
complete with cigarette and coffee?

 Homer's whoop-whoop floor dance


barker@acc.fau.edu points out that Donald O'Connor performs this stunt
in the ``Make 'Em Laugh'' scene in ``Singin' in the Rain''.

 Additional research required...


Shane Roach's girlfriend (csroach@eng.clemson.edu) suggests that the
running-the-plant scene derives from a Fred Astaire movie, in which
Fred and somebody else (Bing Crosby?  Gene Kelly?) singlehandedly run
a ship or naval base or something like that.  This propsal has merit,
because there is a gratuitous scene of Smithers dancing with a straw
hat and cane atop a control panel.


 The USENET ``Biggest stretch for a reference'' award goes to...


... my former classmate Vincent Lai (venlai@cbnewsb.cb.att.com), for
suggesting that the ping-pong table in Burns' basement is a reference
to the term ``Ping-Pong diplomacy'' which had been applied to Nixon's

Alan Barclay (alan.barclay@almac.co.uk) explains that it is important
for baby teeth to grow straight, lest the adult teeth that follow also
grow in crooked.

 Lisa's guitar-playing


Lukas Kendall @{lk} was present for the scoring session for this
episode and reports that Alf Clausen and friends took pains to
synchronize the guitar track to the motion of Lisa's fingers.
Yeardley Smith even came in to re-record the vocals.  ``I didn't say
anything to her as I didn't know who she was until she starting
singing!  Oh, well, live and learn.''

 Monty Burns' age


Ted Frank @{thf} points out that, if Monty Burns was an ambulatory lad
in 1909, that would put him at around age ninety.  Note, however, that
Burns claims, ``I'm only eighty-one'' in [7[FG]02].

 The art of negotiation


Eliot Friedman @{ekf} recalls that Jimmy Hoffa attributed much of his
success as a union negotiator to bladder control.  That is, his
ability to go for hours without having to leave the bargaining table
to answer Nature's call.  Supposedly, the first man to succumb yields
a psychological advantage to his opponent.

If true, then Homer broke Hoffa's rule and still managed to prevail in
the negotiations.

 EPISODE TITLE: So It's Come to This: A Simpsons Clip Show


EPISODE SUMMARY: 

   

 Bart wakes up and finds himself blind.  April Fool!  Homer put duct
 tape over his eyes.

 Bart goes to the fridge and drinks milk out of the carton.  Then
 spits it out.  April Fool!  ``I've been keeping that carton of milk
 next to the furnace for six weeks!''  Bart vows revenge.

 Lisa explains that April Fool's Day dates back to the pagans.
   
   God bless those pagans...
   -- Homer, ``''
   
 The pagan Simpsons family chant ``Blood for Ba'al!'' as they dance
 around a celebratory fire on 1 April 1022.  The Flanders family
 present them what is ostensibly a jar of ram's blood for their
 godless ceremony.  But it's filled with rubber snakes!

 The Flanders are tied to a stake in the middle of the celebratory
 fire, as the Simpsons family chant, ``Now who's laughing!  Now who's
 laughing!''

 Thus ends Homer's explanation of the origin of April Fool's Day.

 At the Frying Dutchman, the staff put charcoal around the eyepiece
 of Captain McAlister's telescope.  In response, Captain McAlister
 instructs, ``From this day, I be requiring hairnets.''

 Bart spies on Homer fetching a can of that wonderful Duff out of the
 fridge, wondering what he could do to get back at his father...
 Meanwhile, Homer admires the can.  ``Ah, my one weakness.  My
 Achilles heel.''  Ah-ha!  But how to exploit it?  Homer drops the
 can, picks it up, and opens it.  ``It's a good thing that beer
 wasn't shaken up any more, or I'd have looked quite the fool.''

 Bart uses a paint shaker at Springfield Hardware to shake up a can
 of Duff.

 Bart takes the still-jiggling can of beer and carefully places it in
 the fridge.  Homer sits on the couch wolfing down pretzels while
 watching Bumblebee Man on television.  Homer muses to himself, ``So
 thirsty...  Eh, whaddya gonna do.''  Frustrated, Bart cranks the
 thermostat into the red zone.  The goldfish bowl boils, vinyl
 records melt, but Homer is unaffected.
   
   TV:    The following is a public service announcement.
          Excessive alcohol consumption can cause liver damage
          and cancer of the rectum.
   Homer: Mmmmm... beer...
   -- Homer, ``''
   
  He goes to the fridge, removes the can, and opens it.  Bart emerges
 from his hiding place and announces, ``April F---!''  Before he can
 finish his sentence, the roof of the house explodes.
   
   Eddie: That sounded like an explosion at the old Simpson place.
   Wiggum: Forget it.  That's two blocks away.
   -- ``''
   
   Eddie:  Looks like there's beer coming out of the chimney!
   Wiggum: [gets out of the car] I am proceeding on foot.  Call in a Code 8.
   Eddie:  [into radio]  We need pretzels.  Repeat, pretzels.
   -- ``''
   
 [End of Act One.  Time: 3:58]

 At Springfield Hospital, Dr. Hibbert relates the bad news.  ``Mrs.
 Simpson, I'm afraid your husband is dead.''  Ha ha, April Fool's.
 He's not dead.  Though he may not walk again.

 Marge visits a wheelchair-bound Homer.  The vet from [8[FG]17] indicates
 the numerous blows to the head evident on Homer's x-rays.

 Clips:  Bart throws a baseball at Homer. [7[FG]11]
 Homer is hit by a pitch. [8[FG]13]
 Homer is hit on the head by a circular saw. [8[FG]06]
 Homer falls asleep in the Kwik-E-Mart doors. [8[FG]06]
 Maggie whaps Homer on the head. [7[FG]09]

 And Homer's brain waves are disturbingly erratic.

 Clips:  Electro-shock therapy. [7[FG]04]
 Homer's skateboarding injuries. [7[FG]06]

 Marge recognizes the vet.

 Clips:  A visit to the vet. [8[FG]17]

 Dr. Hibbert is shocked that the doctor is a vet.  The vet adds,
 ``And for an extra $20, I'll give Homer a tick bath, and then spay
 him.''  Bart holds out a wad of bills.  When Marge objects, Bart
 explains, ``Shop around.  You can't beat that price.''

 Homer is in his hospital bed, surrounded by his loving family.

 Clips:  Lost in the forest. [7[FG]09]
 The arrival of the flying saucers. [7[FG]04]
 Oh Say, Can You See? [7[FG]09]

 Marge asks Bart what that last clip had to do with anything.
   
   It was an amusing episode.  ... Of our lives.
   -- Bart, ``''
   
 Barney and Moe pay a visit, but Barney is unable to cope.

 Homer is worried that, if confined to a wheelchair, he will be
 unable to continue his life's work.  Marge recalls the strength of
 their marriage.

 Clips:  Marge pays a visit to the plant. [7[FG]11]

 That evening, two therapists try to get Homer to stand up from his
 wheelchair, but Homer cannot.  They leave, resigned to failure.
 Homer spots a candy machine at the end of the hall.
   
   Mmm... Chocolate...
   -- Homer, ``''
   
 Clips:  The Land of Chocolate. [8[FG]09]

 In a trance, Homer rises from his wheelchair and walks to the candy
 machine.  In go the coins.  The spiral turns.  But the candy bar
 does not fall.  Furious, he jostles the machine, which falls on him.
 The candy bars fall into his mouth.  After the cut to black, we hear
 a painful swallow, followed by a relieved, ``Oh, yeah...''

 [End of Act Two.  Time: 13:16]

 Grampa stands vigil over Homer's bed.
   
   Marge:  Please, Grampa, he's in a coma.
   Grampa: Coma!?  Pfffft.  Why, I go in and out of comas all the...
           [falls asleep]
           [wakes up]  French toast, please.
   -- ``''
   
 When asked what a coma is like, Grampa explains, ``It's like one of
 those TV shows where the show a bunch of clips from old episodes.''
 Bart muses, ``I wonder what he's thinking now...''

 Clip:  Slumberland.  (With the enhanced soundtrack.)  [8[FG]06]

 Burns storms in, furious that Homer is costing him $5000 a day.  ``I
 demand he die with dignity.''  He pulls the plug.  Dr. Hibbert plugs
 it back in.  Burns demands a second opinion, and in pops Dr. Nick
 Riviera.  Nick says Homer is dead.  Burns explains his
 cold-hearted-ness: ``You have no idea, what that man has put me
 through.''

 Clip:  Homer asks for money from Burns. [8[FG]17]

 Dr. John Frink suggests a Fantastic Voyage into Homer's body,
 holding a miniature submarine.

 Lisa stands vigil by Homer's bedside.

 Clip:  Lisa plays the sax for Homer.  [7[FG]11]

 Lisa plays the sax once again for her father.

 Bart apologizes to an unconscious Homer.  ``I know I'm not the
 perfect kid.''

 Clip:  Indiana Bart. [8[FG]22]

 ``And sometimes I got you mad...''

 Clips:  32 ``D'oh''s. [various]

 ``And sometimes I get into trouble...''

 Clip:  Lisa eats pistachio ice cream. [7[FG]05]

 ``But you've always looked out for me...''

 Clip:  Homer checks on the boys. [7[FG]21]

 ``And no matter what happens, I'll never forget the advice you gave me...''

 Clip:  Shaving lessons.  [7[FG]11]

 Bart is in tears.  ``Dad, it's all my fault.  I shook up that can of beer.''

 They say that people in comas can still hear you talk, and this proves
 true in cartoon-land as well.  Homer gradually comes to life and
 strangles Bart.  Marge and the girls celebrate, as Homer, now fully
 recovered, strangles Bart with both hands.

 Homer is released and joins his family in the hospital lobby.
 ``This calls for a celebration.  We're all going to Hawaii!''  April
 Fool's!  But the family tell him that it's mid-May; he was in a coma
 for seven weeks.  After a pause, all burst out laughing.  Marge
 adds, ``You lost five percent of your brain!''  Homer asks, ``Me
 lose brain?  Uh-oh!''  More laughter.  (Homer asks, ``Why I
 laugh?'')

 Reviews


Yours truly @{rjc}: Although the concept was carried off about as well
as one could expect, it was essentially a one-joke episode, and I'm
not entirely convinced that the one joke deserved to be told.  (``Get
a Life'' does much better at the self-spoofing genre.)  And the movie
reference was gratuitous.  I have the feeling that this episode was
written on a dare.

 EPISODE TITLE: The Front


EPISODE SUMMARY: 

   

 Cooking with Krusty.  The chef says he got Krusty's mother's
 recipe for matzoh brie.  Krusty angrily tells the chef, ``I don't
 do the Jewish stuff on the air!''
   
   Ixnay on the Oojay!
   -- Ustykray the Ownklay, ``''
   
 As Lisa notes that Krusty is ashamed of his roots, Homer comes in,
 a plunger stuck to his head.
   
   What are you going to change your name to when you grow up?
   -- Bart to Lisa, ``''
   
 Lisa chooses Laura Sandborne.  Bart likes Steve Bennett.  Up comes
 an Itchy and Scratch cartoon.  But it's awful.
   
   Eh, I could pull a better cartoon out of my a...heheheh-hey!  Whoa!
   Wasn't that great, kids?
   -- Krusty discovers the wonders of live television, ``''
   
   Lisa: The writers should be ashamed of themselves!
   Bart: Cartoons have writers?
   -- I thought it was just a bunch of stuff that happened, ``''
   
 Bart grouses, ``We could probably write a better cartoon ourselves.''
   
   Lisa: Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
   Bart: Probably not.
   -- ``''
   
 And he's right.  Bart thinks about hijacking Santa's sleigh.

 Going through the daily mail, Marge finds (after a bunch of collection
 notices) an invitation to her high school reunion.  Oddly, there isn't
 an invitation for Homer.
   
   Homer's brain: This is it, Homer.  It's time to tell her the horrible secret
          from your past.
   Homer: Marge I ate those fancy soaps you bought for the bathroom.
   Marge: Oh, my God!
   Homer's brain: No, the other secret!
   -- One secret at a time, ``''
   
   Homer: I never passed Remedial Science 1A.
   Marge: And you're a nuclear technician?
   -- But his job description clearly specified an illiterate, ``''
   
 Lisa reads a book on writing cartoons.  The first thing is to find a
 setting.  Outside, Homer clips the hedges, and accidentally
 truncates Marge's do.  Bart suggests a barber shop.  Lisa and Bart
 put together a cartoon starring Itchy as a barber.  But they reach a
 sticky point: Whose name goes first?
   
   Lisa:  Look, there's only one way to settle this.  Rock-paper-scissors.
   Lisa's brain: Poor predictable Bart.  Always takes `rock'.
   Bart's brain: Good ol' `rock'.  Nuthin' beats that!
   Bart:  Rock!
   Lisa:  Paper.
   Bart:  D'oh!
   -- ``''
   
 At Itchy and Scratchy, Intl., Roger Meyers bawls out one of his
 Harvard-educated writers.  His secretary delivers Lisa and Bart's
 script.  Meyers doesn't get past the second sentence.

 Rejected and dejected, Lisa suggests they put a grown-up's name
 on the script instead.
   
   What about Grampa?  He's pretty out of it.
   He let those guys use his checkbook for a whole year.
   -- Bart, ``''
   
 Grampa types an angry letter.
   
   When I read your magazine, I don't see one wrinkled face or single
   toothless grin.  For shame!  To the sickos at `Modern Bride' magazine.
   -- Grampa Simpson writes a letter, ``''
   
   Bart:   Hey, Grampa, we need to know your first name.
   Grampa: You're making my tombstone!?
   -- ``''
   
   Whenever I'm confused, I just check my underwear!
   -- Grampa Simpson, ``''
   
 Grampa removes his underwear directly and consults it.  His name is
 Abraham.  And he doesn't know how he removed his underwear without
 taking off his pants.

 Late at night, at Itchy and Scratchy, Intl., Roger Meyers reads
 ``The Little Barber Shop of Horrors'', by Abraham Simpson.  And he
 likes it.  When his secretary calls Grampa, he denies any knowledge
 of ``Ishy'', but quickly changes his tune when he learns that there's
 a check in it for him.

 [End of Act One.  Time: 6:33]

 Homer looks over his high school yearbook and reminisces on his high
 school years.  Somehow, Homer confuses his own life with that of
 Richie Cunningham.

 Principal Dondelinger greets Marge, but mistakes Homer for a vagrant.
 Homer recognizes Bobby Mindix, the class clown, still up to his old
 tricks.  Along comes Artie Ziff, now stinking rich, but he admits that
 he'd trade his wealth for one night with Marge.  Homer considers the
 offer.
 
 Homer is the only one laughing at Bobby's various impressions at the
 lectern.  Next come the awards.
   
   Bobby: First, the award for the alumnus who gaied the most weight.
          Homer Simpson!
   Homer: Oh, my God!
   Bobby: How'd you do it, Homer?
   Homer: I discovered a meal between breakfast and brunch.
   -- ``''
   
 He continues to win unflattering awards.
   
   What can I say?  It hasn't been easy staying in my rut.
   -- Homer accepts an award, ``''
   
 But Homer must return his awards when it becomes known that he never
 passed Remedial Science 1A.  He is laughed off the stage.  Homer vows
 to get his high school diploma and reclaim his awards.

 Roger Meyers is impressed by Grampa's experience and hires him for
 $800 a week.  He introduces Grampa to the staff.

 Krusty shows the kids his nicotine patch.  Unable to stand it any longer,
 he licks the patch directly.  Time for a cartoon.
   
   Bart!  Our cartoon's on TV!
   -- Lisa, ``''
   
 Unfortunately, when Lisa clicks the remote to turn up the volume,
 she hits the channel-changer instead.  By the time she corrects her
 error, the cartoon has nearly ended.  Homer tells the kids that he
 didn't finish high school.  Bart's laughter (and subsequent
 strangulation) is interrupted by the doorbell.  It's Grampa (in an
 expensive suit), who tells Homer that he just stopped by on his way
 home from work.  His job is to tell a cat and mouse what to do.  Homer
 imagines carting Grampa off to the nut-house in a wheelbarrow.

 Bart and Lisa explain to Grampa what they did.
   
   Lisa;   Didn't you wonder why you were getting checks for doing nothing?
   Grampa: I figured, 'cuz the Democrats were in power again.
   -- ``''
   
 Lisa suggests they continue the ruse, splitting the money three
 ways.  Grampa asks to sleep on it, and promptly dozes off.  Bart
 wakes Grampa from the arms of Morphius.  Grampa quickly agrees,
 so that he can return to his dream.  (I can't describe it.)

 [End of Act Two.  Time:  13:16]

 Roger Meyer offers to show Bart and Lisa around the studio.  Abe
 turns down the offer, since there is a flight of stairs involved.
 (He goes back to sleep.)  Meyers leads the kids down the animation
 wing.  ``Sometimes, to save money, our animators will re-use the
 same backgrounds over and over and over again.''  They walk down the
 hallway, past the same water cooler and cleaning lady several times.

 Remedial Science 1A begins.  Meanwhile, Krusty, his body covered in
 nicotine patches, asks Mel for yet another.  (Mel applies it to
 Krusty's butt.)  Another Abraham Simpson cartoon is shown.

 Mr. Dondelinger burns a donut to demonstrate how many calories it
 has.  Homer screams in agony.
   
   Dear Mr. President.  There are too many states nowadays.
   Please eliminate three.  I am not a crackpot!
   -- Grampa Simpson writes another letter, ``''
   
 Grampa has been nominated for an award.  Meyers has fired the other
 writers.  ``From now on, the fate of the entire company rests on that
 delightful coconut of yours.''  Grampa confesses to being a complete
 fraud, but Meyers was momentarily distracted and didn't hear.

 Final exam, fifty questions, true or false.
   
   Homer: All right brain, you don't like me, and I don't like you.
          But let's just get me through this, and I can get back to killing
          you with beer.  
   Homer's brain:  It's a deal!
   -- ``''
   
 Grampa preps for awards night.  The presenters for Outstanding
 Writing in a Cartoon Series are Krusty and Brooke Shields.  The
 prepared joke sucks.  Krusty storms off in disgust.  Brooke carries
 on by herself.  The nominees are ``Strondar, Master of Vacom: the
 wedding episode)'' [a He-Man knock-off], ``Action Figure Man: the
 how to buy action figure man episode'', ``Ren and Stimpy: season
 premi\`ere'' (clip not done yet), and ``Itchy and Scratchy''.
 Grampa watches the clip with horror.  And the winner is Itchy and
 Scratchy.  Grampa takes the stage and expresses his disgust,
 earning a resounding boo (and thrown fruit) from the audience.
   
   I'll never watch an awards show again.
   -- Bart Simpson, ``''
   
 Homer proudly shows his passing test to Marge.  ``At our next high
 school reunion, I'll have nothing to be ashamed of.''

 EPISODE TITLE: Whacking Day


EPISODE SUMMARY: 

   

 Tipped off that Superintendent Chalmers is paying the school a
 surprise visit, Skinner puts the school into clean-up mode.  He also
 announces a list of students who have won mountain bikes: Bart,
 Jimbo, Kearny and Dolph, and Nelson.  He instructs them to pick up
 their bikes in Utility Basement B, then cackles evilly.  Then
 remembers to turn off the microphone.  When the school troublemakers
 arrive, they find the utility room empty.  Skinner apologizes for
 the deception, but ``you're being swept under the rug for the
 superintendent's visit.''  He locks them in.

 Skinner sucks up big-time.
   
   Skinner:  Superintendent Chalmers, welcome!
   Chalmers: [dryly] Hello, Seymour.
   Skinner:  So, what's the word down at One School Board Plaza?
   Chalmers: We're dropping the geography requirement.
             The children weren't testing well.
             It's proving to be an embarrassment.
   Skinner:  Very good.  Back to the three R's.
   Chalmers: Two R's, come October.
   -- ``''
   
 Chalmers sees through Skinner's ``transparent toadying''.

 Bart tries to escape through a ventilation shaft.

 Skinner sucks up even more.

 Groundskeeper Willie tends to his tractor, but is distracted by a
 comely young Scottish lass, and the two leave together.

 Chalmers is brought to the second-grade class, where Skinner selects
 a student `at random'.  Chalmers selects Ralph, but Skinner quickly
 suggests Lisa instead.  Lisa performs admirably.  Ralph less so.
 Skinner tries to cover up.

 Bart emerges from the vent and spots Willy's tractor, which goads Bart
 into taking it for a ride.  Bart quickly careens out of control.
   
   Excellent.  Not a trace of urine.
   -- Superintendent Chalmers inspects the school sandbox, ``''
   
 Chalmers is impressed.  ``Why, that looks like a fifty-cent piece.
 I'll just bend over and get it.''  Bad move.  Bart abandons the
 tractor seconds before impact.

 While Lunch Lady Doris tends to Chalmers' wounds, he tells Skinner
 that but for the horrible accident, he would've been promoted to
 Assistant Superintendent.  In response, Skinner expels Bart.

 [End of Act One.  Time: 5:45]

 ``Eye on Springfield'' takes a look at the Springfield tradition
 known as ``''.  Founded by Jebediah Springfield in 1775,
 every May 10th, the citizens of Springfield drive the snakes into
 the town square, then club them to death.  Footage of Richard Nixon
 taking part is shown.  Lisa expresses her disgust.
   
   Homer:  Hey, kids, how was school?
   Lisa:   I learned how many grams in a pennyweight.
   Bart:   I got expelled.
   Homer:  That's my boy! [sips his Duff] Mmm... beer... [double-take] What!?
   -- It's beer, Homer, ``''
   
 Bart is enrolled in the local Christian fundamentalist school, but
 doesn't last long.

 At the dinner table, Bart considers a future as a taster of
 dangerous food additives, but Marge decides to teach Bart herself.
 Meanwhile, Lisa fails to impress upon Homer the evils of Whacking
 Day.

 Bart relaxes on the couch while Lisa heads for school, but Marge
 tells Bart to be in class before the bell rings.  Class is set up in
 the garage, with a blackboard, teacher's desk, student's desk, and a
 very loud bell which startles both Bart and Marge.  Marge enjoys the
 r\^ole of teacher, opening the class with formal introductions.

 Math instruction is interrupted by a guest speaker:  Grampa Simpson,
 who tells about his r\^ole in World War II.  Trapped behind enemy
 lines, he spent the war posing as a (female) cabaret singer.  But he
 is found out.
   
   Ach du lieber!  Das is nicht eine Booby!
   -- Adolf Hitler, ``''
   
 When pressed, Grampa insists the story was `mostly' true, especially
 the part about wearing a dress.  The lesson is interrupted by
 Homer's high-speed entry into the garage.  Fortunately, Homer stops
 just in the nick of time.

 Homer shows off to Marge his new whacking stick.  Marge is excited.

 Back in class...
   
   Marge: Bart, I'd like you to read this copy of ``Johnny Tremaine''.
          It's a book I read as a girl.
   Bart:  A book!?  Pfffft.
   Marge: I think you might like this.
          It's about a boy who goes to war.
          His hand is deformed in an accident.
   Bart:  Deformed?  Why didn't you say so!
          They should call this book ``Johnny Deformed''?
   -- I'd prefer ``Johnny Quest Deformed'', ``''
   
 Bart is so engrossed in his reading that he misses the Itchy and
 Scratchy cartoon, guest directed by Oliver Stone.

 Bart presents his book report, and Marge suggests they take a field
 trip to Olde Springfield Towne.  Homer screeches into the garage and
 once again applies the brakes just in time to avoid running over the
 class in progress.

 Lisa sadly watches Homer practice his whacking Ninja-style in the
 backyard.  Her protests fall on deaf ears.

 At Olde Springfield Towne, interviews for town idiot are under way.
 Marge finds Barney passed out in the street.  He's playing the
 governor.  The tour continues.  Bart notices a discrepancy:  The day
 Jebediah Springfield led an attack on Fort Ticonderoga, he allegedly
 also founded .  Bart and Marge are quickly escorted away
 by security (Redcoats).

 Apu announces that there is a snake hidden in the store.  The first
 person to find it wins a free Squishee.  Patrons energetically smash
 everything in sight in search of said snake.  ``I should have put
 more thought into my promotion.''  Meanwhile, the Springfield cops
 take target practice at paper snakes.

 Reverend Lovejoy reads a Bible excerpt to Lisa justifying Whacking
 Day.  Lisa asks to see to see the passage, but Reverend Lovejoy
 quickly hides his Bible.

 [End of Act Two.  Time: 14:40]

  festivities are well under way.  A chorus of young boys
 sing an anthem to .  (To the tune of ``O Tannenbaum''.)
 Meanwhile, Homer turns his lawn into Official  Parking,
 ten dollars per axle.  A googolplex-axled car pulls up.

 Barney whacks imaginary snakes.

 Diamond Joe Quimby appears, one of his sidekicks carrying a
 briefcase full of pre-whacked snakes.

 After some lascivious whacking-day banter between Homer and Marge,
 Lisa once again begs Homer not to take part.

 Snakes look on nervously as Diamond Joe Quimby introduces Larry
 [sic] White to whack off, err, kick off the festivities.  When Barry
 White learns what  is about, he announces, ``You people
 make me sick!''  The crowd cheer in appreciation.  Next up is Miss
 Springfield.
   
   Gentlemen, start your whacking!
   -- Miss Springfield, ``''
   
 While snakes make their escape ahead of the advancing crowd, Bart
 reads about the true history of , and Lisa asks what
 they can do to stop the slaughter.  Bart explains that snakes hear
 through vibrations in the ground, so by playing music with lots of
 bass, they can draw the snakes into the safety of the Simpsons home.
 Lisa can't find any suitable records, but she fortunately spots
 Barry White walking past, and he offers his assistance by singing in
 his rich, deep voice.  The effort proves successful, and the snakes
 reach sanctuary.

 Bart tells the crowd that  was in fact founded in 1924...
   
   I'm an old man.  I hate everything but Matlock.
   -- Grampa Simpson, ``''
   
 and Lisa and Bart turn the crowd around on the subject.  Just in
 time for Quimby's appearance with a dozen dead snakes to be greeted
 with boos.  The snakes slither to freedom down the street into the
 sunset.

 Impressed by Bart's demonstration of independent learning, Skinner
 rescinds Bart's expulsion.  ``You can be reunited with your cums
 Nelson, Jimbo,  Dol---Oh, dear God!''  Nelson, Jimbo, Kearny and
 Dolph are still locked in the utility room.  By this time, their
 conversation is more in the style of a bully support group.  Skinner
 rushes Groundskeeper Willy to school with a load of mountain bikes.
 ``We give them their bikes, no one sues.''

Yours truly @{rjc}: A nice try.  I did like the ``Did Daddy hit the
referee?'' bit, but the episode didn't seem to have any point.  (It
wasn't even a bunch of stuff that happened.)  And there was still too
much singing.

    ... Marge was putting on lipstick outside the fundamentalist school?
        (Huh?)
    ... Lisa was playing an electric guitar?  Nice to know it's getting

 EPISODE TITLE: Marge in Chains


EPISODE SUMMARY: 

   


 ``I Can't Believe They Invented It!''
   
   Hello, everybody, I'm Troy McClure, star of such films as ``P is for Psycho''
   and ``The President's Neck is Missing''.
   -- ``''
   
 As usual, the inventor is Dr. Nick Riviera.  His latest creation is
 an orange juice squeezer called the ``Juice Loosener''.  Homer
 orders one.

 In Osaka, Japan, a Japanese assembly line worker with the flu coughs
 into the box destined for Homer Simpson before sealing it.

 ``6 to 8 weeks later''...  The juice loosener arrives, and Homer is
 immediately greeted with a green cloud of germs.  A similar fate
 befalls the other citizens of Springfield.  Green clouds of germs
 terrorize all of Springfield, while nevertheless obeying all local
 traffic laws.

 Kent Brockman reports that over 300 cases of the dreaded Osaka flu
 have hit Springfield.  One of them being Arnie Pie in the sky, who
 loses his lunch at the corner of Twelfth and Main.  Sunning himself
 on a building roof, Otto proves the unlucky recipient.

 Bart's temperature is normal; he's well enough to go to school.
 Bart asks Marge to take his temperature a second time.  Meanwhile,
 his antibodies realize that it's a school day and allow the virus to
 overrun the body.

 Enjoying his day off from school, Bart watches an Itchy and Scratchy
 cartoon.

 The cartoon is interrupted by an emergency announcement from the
 mayor.  He has cancelled his vacation to the Bahamas as a result of
 the crisis.  (Pull back to reveal that he's standing on a Bermuda
 beach with a faux office backdrop.)

 Burns shows Smither his germ-free, hermetically sealed chamber.  But
 it seems that Homer is inside it, eating a sandwich.
   
   Burns: Who the devil are you?
   Homer: [thinks]  Don't panic.  Just come up with a good story.
          [aloud]  My name is Mr. Burns.
          [thinks] D'oh!
   -- Burns, eh?  ``''
   
 An angry crowd has gathered outside the Hibbert Medical Clinic...
   
   Crowd:   We need a cure!  We need a cure!
   Hibbert: Ho ho ho.  Why, the only cure is bedrest.
            Anything I give you would be a placebo.
   Woman:   [frantic] Where can we get these placebos?
   -- ``''
   
 The crowd overturn a truck in search of placebos, but alas the only
 thing inside is a crate of killer bees.

 Not even the Flanders family has escaped the scourge of the Osaka
 flu.  Rod observes Todd speaking in tongues, but alas, Todd is merely
 delirious.  Ned realizes what it is he did to deserve this punishment
 from above.  Flashback to Ned watching ``Married... with Children''...
 and laughing!
   
   Oh, the network slogan is true!  Watch FOX and be damned for all eternity!
   -- Ned Flanders, ``''
   
   Lisa: Mom, could you bring me more O.J.?
   Bart: Mom, could you get me some of those Flintstones chewable morphine?
   -- Marge tends to an ill family, ``''
   
 Homer wants Marge to change the TV channel for him.  And Grampa wants
 a bottle of bourbon.

 Marge wanders down the Kwik-E-Mart aisles collecting cold remedies
 for her family.  She reaches the counter, her basket filled to the
 brim.  (Helen is behind her in line.)
   
   Marge: And a bottle of aspirin.
   Apu:   [holding a bottle that can't hold more than 10 tablets]
          The aspirin is $24.95.
   Marge: $24.95?!
   Apu:   I lowered the price because an escaped mental patient tampered
          with the bottle.
   -- Our loss is your pain, ``''
   
 Marge reluctantly pays her bill and leaves with a sack of items.
 But when she reaches the door, sirens wail.  Says Apu stiltedly,
 ``Oh dear, the alarm must be broken.''  He asks Marge to step a bit
 to her left, which she does.  Along the doorway is a tape measure,
 which Apu uses to jot down Marge's height.  (8 1/2 feet, incl. hair.)
 Apu tells Sanjay to help Marge pick up her things.  Sanjay winks, and
 a quiet conversation in some Indian language is carried out.  Sanjay
 finds a bottle of bourbon in Marge's coat, which she had forgotten
 to pay for.  The police arrive.
   
   All right, come out with your hands up,
   two cups of coffee,
   an auto freshener that says `Capricorn',
   and something with coconut on it!
   -- And keep them high above your head where I can see them, ``''
   
 [End of Act One.  Time: ??:??]

 Marge and Homer retain the services of Lionel Hutz.  Hutz is
 confident in success, until he sees that he will be facing Judge
 Snyder.  Apparently Hutz kinda ran over his dog.  (Well, replace
 `kinda' with `repeatedly' and `dog' with `son'.)  Homer suggests
 talking to Apu.

 At the Kwik-E-Mart, Apu and Sanjay (wearing party hats) celebrate
 their victory.  Homer asks them to drop the charges, but Apu points
 out that it is the policy of the Kwik-E-Mart (and its parent
 corporation, Nodyne Dynamics Inc.) to prosecute all shoplifters to
 the fullest extent of the law.

 In the sauna, Wiggum (still wearing his police hat) tells Quimby
 (wearing a ``mayor'' sash), ``Don't tell anyone, but Marge Simpson
 was arrested for shoplifting.''  Quimby repeats the pronouncement at
 a major speech.  Gossip about Marge is exchanged over bridge;
 present are Rev. and Mrs. Lovejoy, Miss Hoover, and Dr. Hibbert.  At
 the Flanders homestead, Ned reassures Marge, but when she excuses
 herself to use the bathroom, Maude spies on her.

 The trial begins, and the D.A. is so confident of success, he wastes
 the court's time asking the jury to rate various male hunks.
   
   Ooh, he's going to win!
   -- Lionel Hutz observes the District Attorney, ``''
   
   D.A.   Now, Mrs. Lovejoy, could you tell us a little about Marge Simpson?
   Helen: Well, as the wife of a minister, I'm privy to a lot of
          sensitive information.  And here it is...
   -- ``''
   
 Helen's portrayal of the Simpsons household is none too flattering.
 (But accurate.  Except for the last bit.)

 Dr. Frink proves that Marge was present at the assasination of John
 Kennedy.

 Hutz proposes that Marge merely forgot about the bottle of bourbon.
 (The mention of bourbon rekindles Hutz's own penchant for the potable,
 until he rushes to a pay phone and calls David Crosby for support.)
   
   So, Mr. Nahasapeemapetilon, if that &lt;is&gt; your real name...
   -- Lionel Hutz cross-examines Apu, ``''
   
 When Apu claims a perfect memory, Hutz turns around and challenges
 Apu to describe the tie he's wearing.  Apu's description is right on
 the mark, so Hutz struggles with his tie, eventually taking it off.
 (So there!  I wasn't wearing a tie at all!)

 Hutz joins the Simpsons at dinner, confident in success.
   
   Lisa:  You're a latter-day Clarence Darrow!
   Hutz:  Uh, was he the black guy on the Mod Squad?
   -- No, he's the black guy on the Supreme Court, ``''
   
   If there's one thing America needs, it's more lawyers.
   -- Lionel Hutz, ``''
   
 The thought of a world without lawyers sends a chill up Hutz's spine.

 Lionel Hutz concludes his argument, then realizes he isn't wearing
 any pants.  He tries to get the trial dismissed, unsuccessfully.  He
 tries intercepting the jury's verdict on the way to the judge, but
 that fails as well.  The verdict: Guilty.  Marge is sentenced to
 thirty days.  The next case is ``The National Council of Churches
 v. Lionel Hutz''.

 Marge bids farewell to her kids, but Bart has plans on springing her.
 All he needs is a cocktail dress and a crowbar.
   
   Homer: Marge, I'm going to miss you so much.  And it's not just the sex.
          It's also the food preparation.
   -- ``''
   
 Marge is taken away.  Apu and Sanjay celebrate, confident that their
 store is once again secure.  Cut to Snake carting the entire store
 (literally) away.

 [End of Act Two.  Time: ??:??+7:32]

 Springfield Women's Prison.  Marge greets her cell-mate, Phillips,
 so named because she killed her husband with a Phillips screwdriver.
   
   It's so nice not to have to cook.
   -- Marge enjoys a meal in prison, ``''
   
 She recalls the one time Homer tried to cook.

 Marge is introduced to Tattoo Annie.
   
   Now, kids, while your mother's gone, I don't want to have to wash any
   dishes, so from now on, drink straight from the faucet or milk carton,
   and we'll eat while standing over the sink or toilet.
   -- Homer watches the kids, ``''
   
 Lisa observes that if everyone does their fair share, they can keep
 the house clean.  Ten minutes later, the house is a total mess.
 (Complete with alligator.)
   
   Bart: Dad, we're running out of clean clothes!
   Lisa: It seems like I've been wearing this same red dress forever!
   -- ``''
   
 Homer has found a cache of clothes in the attic.  He appears in a
 wedding gown.

 Bart's lunch consists of a pack of sugar and peanut butter smeared
 on a playing card.
   
   Nelson:  Hah-hah!  Your mom's a jailbird!
   Bart:    So's yours.
   Nelson:  Oh yeah.
   -- ``''
   
 The kids visit Marge.  Homer is dressed in an old Hallowe'en
 costume.  Leaving Grampa alone with a 'gator stuck halfway down the
 toilet.  In the conjugal visit trailer, Homer doesn't want to push
 anything.  ``We can just hold hands, or sit and talk...'' Marge
 leaps onto him.  The trailer tips over.

 The ``Beautify Our Parks'' bake sale falls flat when the customers
 learn that Marge's marshmallow treats aren't for sale.  Fifteen
 dollars short, instead of getting a statue of Lincoln, the park
 commissioner must settle for a statue of Jimmy Carter.  The crowd
 riots.  ``This never would have happened if Marge Simpson was
 here,'' laments Maude.

 Marge is released, and her cell-mate reveals that she has a new
 boyfriend.  It's Barney, going under Homer's name.

 Bart and Lisa stand in a room filled with junk that needs to be
 cleaned up before Marge comes home.  So they sweep it under the rug.
 All of it.

 Marge is given a warm greeting by the townspeople upon her return.
   
   From now on, I'll use my gossip for good instead of evil.
   -- Helen Lovejoy, ``''
   
 All cheer, and Quimy unveils a special treat:  The Jimmy Carter
 statue has been given a Marge Simpson 'do.

 Later, Bart and Lisa use the statue as a tetherball pole.

 Comments and other observations


 Jimmy Carter


Odd that the city opted for Jimmy Carter, even though Marge voted for
him.  Twice.  (Ah, Jimmy Carter.  The president whose main faults were
that he was too nice, too smart, and too honest.  Traits least
befitting a politician.)

 Cross-dressing


Okay, this cross-dressing thing is getting out of hand.  It started
innocently enough...

[9[FG]02] Bart wears Lisa's high heels.

Then it gets a little weird.

[9[FG]16] Grampa's dream.
[9[FG]18] Grampa entertains the Nazis.

But now it's out of control.

[9[FG]20] Bart's plan to help Marge escape.
[9[FG]20] Homer wears a wedding dress.

On the other hand, after all, how many of us can honestly say that at
one time or another he hasn't felt sexually aroused by wearing women's
clothing.  I know I have.  I mean, most normal adolescents go through
a stage of wearing panties two or three times a day.  Some youngsters
on the other hand are attracted to it by its very illegality.  It's
like murder---make a thing illegal and it acquires a mystique.  Look
at arson---I mean, how many of us can honestly say that at one time or
another he hasn't set fire to some great public building?  I know I
have.  The only way to bring the crime figures down is to reduce the
number of offences---get it out into the open---I know I have.

 EPISODE TITLE: Krusty Gets Kancelled


EPISODE SUMMARY: 

   

 Live from (polluted) Springfield Harbor, it's ``Springfield
 Squares'', with your host, Kent Brockman.  The show is, however cut
 short by a fifty-foot tidal wave.  Then follows a brief but
 arresting advertisement for ``Gabbo'', whoever that is.  The
 advertising blitz continues, and the day finally arrives at which
 Gabbo's identity will be revealed.  To great fanfare, we discover
 that Gabbo is a ventriloquist's dummy, the host of a television
 program at 4pm, directly against the Krusty the Klown Show.
   
   Bart:   That cute little character could take America by storm.
           All he needs is a hook.
   Gabbo:  [coyly] I'm a bad widdle boy.
   Bart:   Ay, Carumba!
   -- Fool me once, shame on you... ``Krusty Gets Cancelled''
   
 Gabbo performs for the audience (``I can do the Hully-Gully; I can
 imitate Vin Scully!'')

 In his dressing room, Krusty remains confident.
   
   Krusty: I've had plenty of guys come after me, and I've buried them all.
           Sea Captain.  Joey Bishop.
   Pennycandy: Don't forget the Special Olympics.
   Krusty: [wistfully] Oh, yeah...  I slaughtered the Special Olympics!
   -- ``''
   
 The ratings report is in.  Krusty lost even to the Mexican bee guy.

 Bart, Nelson and Milhouse discover new things to do with a slot car
 race track.  Then tune in for the Krusty the Klown Show.  Krusty has
 obtained a ventriloquist dummy sidekick, but its gruesome appearance
 scares the kids rather than entertains them.

 Krusty is really hurting.
   
   Krusty: All right, here's the deal.  Every time you watch my show,
           I will send you... [holds up a check] forty dollars!
   Voice:  [fine print]  Checks will not be honored.
   -- ``''
   
 Quimby addresses his constituency.
   
   Quimby: I'll admit I used the city treasury to fund the murder of my enemies.
           But as Gabbo would say, ``I'm a bad widdle boy.''
   Crowd:  Yaaaaaay!
   -- ``''
   
 The headline reads, ``Quimby Re-Elected in Landslide''.  (Second
 story: ``Two more bodies surface in Springfield Harbor.'')

 Since Itchy and Scratchy have moved to Gabbo's show, Krusty is
 reduced to showing Eastern Europe's favorite cat-and-mouse team.
 Unfortunately, the struggle of class against class and the workers'
 control of the means of production isn't quite as funny.  Krusty
 looks out to see the studio completely empty.

 [End of Act One.  Time: 5:38]

 Krusty bids farewell to his crew, now that they've been cancelled,
 but proud that at least they never had a bad show.  Well, except for
 the one with Ray Jay Johnson.

 Krusty pays a visit to Johnny Carson looking for tips on how to deal
 with leaving the world of television.  Unfortunately, Krusty didn't
 save up for a rainy day.

 Krusty auditions for a r\^ole on Melrose Place.  He doesn't get the
 part.

 Krusty blows his last ten bucks at Springfield Downs.  (Now a horse
 racing track.)
   
   Gabbo:  And now it's time for another patented Gabbo Crank Call!
   Bart:   I can't believe it.  He stole this bit from Krusty!
   Lisa:   Yeah, well, Krusty stole it from Steve Allen.
   -- Is there anything that &lt;isn't&gt; stolen from Steve Allen?
      ``''
   
 The victim is Krusty the Klown.  ``Is this the call back from that
 porno film?''  Gabbo pretends to be representing a Japanese camera
 company looking for a spokesman.  Krusty eagerly accepts (in a bad
 Chinese accent).  After putting Krusty through more abuse, the joke
 is revealed.
   
   If this is anyone other than Steve Allen, you're stealing my bit!
   -- Krusty the ex-Klown, ``''
   
   Bart:   Somebody ought to ruin Gabbo's career the way he ruined Krusty's.
   Lisa:   Two wrongs don't make a right, Bart.
   Bart:   Yes they do.
   Lisa:   No they don't.
   Bart:   Yes they do!
   Lisa:   No they don't!
   Bart:   Yes they do!!
   Lisa:   Daaaad!
   Homer:  Two wrongs make a right, Lisa.
   -- ``''
   
 At KBBL studios, the Gabbo show cuts to a commercial.  After the
 cameras are off, Gabbo mutters, ``That ought to hold the SOB's.''
 Bart slips into the studio and distracts the cameraman.  During the
 diversion, Bart turns on the camera in time to catch Gabbo repeat
 himself, ``All the kids in Springfield are SOB's.''

 Gabbo's Gaffe makes the news.  Brockman concludes his report and,
 thinking the camera is off, mutters, ``That ought to hold the
 SOB's.''

 Headlines:  ``Gabbo still #1 in Springfield.''
 Second story:  ``Brockman fired.''

 Bart and Lisa are shocked to see a tattered Krusty holding a
 cardboard sign which reads, ``Will drop pants for food.''  What's
 worse, there's an old man doing it for free a few meters down the
 sidewalk.  Krusty takes the kids to his shabby apartment.
   
   Thirty-five years in television and already nobody remembers me.
   Just like what's-his-face.
   -- Krusty the Klown, ``''
   
 Bart and Lisa are inspired by the photos of Krusty with famous
 people.
   
   Bart:   I didn't know you knew Luke Perry.
   Krusty: Pfft.  Know him?  He's my worthless half-brother.
   Lisa:   He's a big TV star.
   Krusty: Yeah.  [scoffing]  On FOX.
   -- Does Rabbi Krustofsky know?  ``''
   
 (Note the darts embedded in the photo of Luke Perry.)  Lisa suggests
 Krusty enlist the aid of these famous people to get his career back
 on track.  Thus inspired, he gives Bart and Lisa his address book
 and sends them on their task.  He then turns on the television, to
 see that the crazy old man with his pants by his ankles is now the
 star of his own television program.

 [End of Act Two.  Time: 10:40]

 Bart and Lisa find Bette Midler picking up litter along the highway,
 a sign proclaiming, ``Litter removal next 2 miles courtesy of Bette
 Midler.''  When Snake tosses an empty beer can by the side of the
 road, she chases him down (I am not making this up) and throws the
 can back into the truck, sending the vehicle skidding off the road.
 Bette agrees to appear on Krusty's Comeback Special.  Another driver
 litters the roadway, and Bette dutifully dispatches the offender.

 Bart visits Hugh Hefner at his Shelbyville mansion.

 Moe invited the Red Hot Chili Peppers to perform at the Tavern under
 false pretenses.  They are not pleased.  They quickly accept Bart's
 request for them to appear on Krusty's show.  Bart distracts Moe
 (``Hey, Moe.  look over there!''  ``What?  What am I looking at?'')
 thus letting the singers escape.

 Elizabeth Taylor is pleased that her agent told Bart and Lisa to
 buzz off.

 Bart and Lisa return to Krusty's apartment to find a huge, bloated
 sack of protoplasm on the floor.  To get himself into shape, he
 drank nothing but milkshakes.  ``You mean those diet milkshakes?''
 Krusty merely answers, ``Uh-oh...''

 Homer prepares the couch for Krusty's stay at the Simpson residence.
 He tries to unfold the couch, ripping it before realizing that the
 couch doesn't convert into a bed.

 Marge and Krusty work out.  (Marge's floppy hair knocks items off
 the mantlepiece.)

 Krusty performs target practise with purple pies and Homer's face.

 Homer and Krusty spar with boxing gloves.  Krusty regains his
 enthusiasm when Gobbo appears on television.  Maggie changes the
 channel to the news, where Scott Christian reports that pork prices
 rose sharply.  This inspires Homer.

 Krusty punches a side of beef while Homer eats it.

 Krusty visits the Gulp 'n' Blow, where Sideshow Mel has since gotten
 a job, to cajole his former sidekick to rejoin him.  Mel steadfastly
 refuses.  (Meanwhile, the pimple-faced employee drops Krusty's taco
 into the fryer and tries to fish it out.)

 At KrustyLu studios, they rehearse the balloon bit.  Krusty makes a
 crude horse.  Sideshow Luke makes an elaborate nineteenth-century
 carousel.  Krusty is furious that he's been upstaged, but Luke begs
 to stay on and help in any way he can.  Krusty imagines firing Kule
 out of a cannon, face-first into a brock wall.

 Headline:  ``Krusty Special Airs Today.''
 Second story:  ``Gabbo to have `Real Boy' operation''.

 In the dressing room, Krusty asks the Red Hot Chili Peppers to tone
 down their lyrics.

 The Krusty Comeback Special begins, with Krusty singing ``Send in
 the Clowns'', joined by Sideshow Mel.  Krusty fires Super Luke out
 of a cannon.  He sails out of the studio, through the museum of
 sandpaper, through a display of acid at the Kwik-E-Mart, but landing
 safely in a pillow factory.  Seconds before it is demolished.

 The Red Hot Chili Peppers perform.

 Johnny Carson juggles an automobile.

 Hugh Hefner plays ``Peter and the Wolf'' on wine glasses.

 Liz Taylor is proud she isn't on the show.

 Bette Midler sings, and Krusty joins her.  (Just like Johnny's last
 show.)

 Afterwards, Moe's Tavern is filled with revelers.  Hugh Hefner
 scores `Cold Fish' on the Love Tester.  Johnny reminds Krusty how
 important it is to save his money.  (Just as Krusty's ruby-studded
 clown nose is delivered.)  The Red Hot Chili Peppers arrive, still
 in their underwear.  Moe tries to throw them out, but Wiggum and
 Hibbert (also in their underwear) tell Moe to get with the times.
   
   Krusty: I don't know how to thank you kids.
   Bart:   That's all right, Krusty.
   Lisa:   We're getting fifty percent of the T-shirt sales.
   -- The money is in the merchandising, ``''
   
 Bart proposes a toast.  ``To Krusty, the greatest entertainer in
 the world.  Except for that guy.''  Bart points to Johnny Carson,
 tap-dancing and playing the accordion while balancing a board on
 his head atop which sit Grampa and Jasper.  He plays ``Good Night
 Ladies'', then the Simpsons theme.

 Previous episodes


 Ray Jay Johnson


Around 1978, a major beer company (which usually employes washed-up former
althletes) inexplicably achieved great success with the annoying voice
of ``You can call me Ray, or you can call me Jay'' Johnson.  ``That
thing was funny for about three seconds.''

Note that Krusty counts the Ray Jay Johnson episode as worse than
the one crashed by S.N.U.H., or the one during which he suffered his
heart attack.

 Vin Scully


Vin Scully is a veteran baseball announcer.

 Scott Christian's news report


Apparently, Channel 6 decided to replace Krusty's program with the
early afternoon news report.

 EPISODE TITLE: Homer's Barbershop Quartet


EPISODE SUMMARY: 
[Syndication cuts are marked in curly braces "{}" and are courtesy of
Ricardo Lafaurie and Frederic Briere.]

It's the day of the Springfield Swap Meet!  Mayor Quimby watches the
proceedings from a podium.

Quimby: [to his bodyguards] Human roaches, feeding off each others'
        garbage!  The only thing you can't buy here is dignity.  [taps
        the microphone] Welcome swappers!  To the Springfield swap meet!
        Ich bin ein Springfield swap meet patron!
         [Applause]
         [to his bodyguards] I need a drink and a shower.
-- He loves his job, 

Moe is selling oyster shells that resemble Lucille Ball.  Meanwhile,
Bart, Nelson, and Milhouse check out Ned Flanders' booth.

    Bart: Oh boy!  Free trading cards!
Milhouse: Wow!  Joseph of Arimathea!  Twenty six conversions in A.D. 46.
  Nelson: Whoa, a Methuselah rookie card!
Flanders: Heh heh, well boys, who'd have thought learning about religion
          could be fun?
    Bart: Religion?
Milhouse: Learning?
  Nelson: Let's get out of here!
-- Wouldn't want that, 

Meanwhile, Lisa is at another booth.

Lisa: Wow, an original Malibu Stacey from 1958!  [Sees the huge, pointed
      breasts] Oh...
 Man: Yeah, they took her off the market after some kid put both his
      eyes out.
-- That'll teach boys to play with dolls, 

Principal Skinner rediscovers his prison mask from the Viet Cong
internment center.  He comments to Herman how small a world it is.
Homer looks through the five cent box at another booth, dismissing as
junk an original document from congress, Action Comics No. 1, a set of
stamps with upside down airplanes on them, and a violin autographed by
"Stradi-who-vius?"

Marge tries her luck at selling stuff at her own booth.

Marge: Your teenage son or daughter will think this wishbone necklace is
       really cool!
  Man: I doubt my son or daughter is that stupid.
-- Kids these days, 

Bart and Lisa check out the $1.00 record booth.  The booth operator
plays a cut from "Melvin and the Squirrels" for Bart, to let him sample
the rodent invasion of the '60s.

Lisa notices an album titled, "Meet the Be Sharps", with a photo of
Homer on the front.  Both children are curious.

 Bart: Dad, when did you record an album?
Homer: I'm surprised you don't remember, son.  It was only eight years
       ago.
 Bart: Dad, thanks to television, I can't remember what happened eight
       minutes ago.
        [Everyone laughs uproariously except Bart]
       No, really, I can't!  It's a serious problem.
        [Everyone laughs again, and Bart finally relents and laughs too]
       What are we all laughing about?
Homer: [joyously] Who cares?  Anyways...
-- 

Homer begins to narrate the tale of his barbershop quartet.  It begins
in 1985.

 Homer: Every afternoon at Moe's, Chief Wiggum, Principal Skinner, Apu,
        and I would get together and sing, and the crowds went wild!
         [Scene shows roses and underwear getting thrown on stage]
Barney: [The only audience member, seductively] Yoo hoo!
-- One's a crowd, 

 Bart: [incredulous] Barbershop?  That ain't been popular since aught
       six, dagnab it.
Homer: [reproachfully] Bart, what did I tell you?
 Bart: [abashed] No talking like a grizzled 1890s prospector...consarn
       it.
-- The cockney bootblack within, 

Homer continues his narration.

Anyway, rock and roll had become stagnant.  "Achy Breaky Heart" was
seven years away; something had to fill the void.  That something was
barbershop.
-- Homer tells it like it is, 

The four singers end their show with "Goodbye, My Coney Island Baby".
Abe and another man watch from the audience.

Abe: That's my son up there!
Man: What, the balding fat-ass?
Abe: Uh, no, the...Hindu guy.
-- Abe thinks under pressure, 

The quartet even get to perform at the Springfield prison.
Unfortunately for Chief Wiggum, Snake decides to throw a rock at him
after the performance is over.

Reverend Lovejoy invites the fab four to sing at the First Church of
Springfield.  The audience are enthralled, and donate particularly
generously.  The reverend looks pleased.  Ned Flanders, a sidesman,
isn't so sure.

Ned: You know, reverend, this really isn't a hymn.
Rev: [crossly] Ned, there's an oil stain in the parking lot that looks
     just like St. Barnabas.
Ned: [aghast] Oh, my stars!
-- That oughta keep him busy, 

Homer et al. perform back at Moe's, and finish to wild applause.  Homer
goes to get himself a beer.  He's approached by Nigel.

Nigel: Homer, I'm a theatrical agent, and I want to represent your
       group.  [Hands Homer his card]
Homer: Really?
Nigel: Yeah.  You've got _it_.  All except that police officer.  Yuck!
       Too "Village People".
-- But they were great!, 

Homer assures Nigel he can handle Wiggum.  Homer drives the panting
Chief out to a deserted country road, and stops the car.  "Run along,
boy!  You're free now!"  Wiggum jumps out, and Homer drives off.  Soon,
Wiggum sees his predicament, and he howls unhappily at the full moon.

Back at Moe's, Nigel is introduced to the remaining two members.
Principal Skinner shakes Nigel's hand.

  Apu: [introducing himself] Apu Nahasapeemapetilon.
Nigel: Hmm.  Never fit on a marquee, luv.  From now on, your name is Apu
       de Beaumarchais.
  Apu: [unhappily] That is a great dishonor to my ancestors and my
       god...[brightens] but okay!
-- Twist my arm, 

The trio begins to audition for Chief Wiggum's replacement.  Abe,
groundskeeper Willy, {Jasper}, and Chief Wiggum disguised as Dr.
Dolittle all try out, but "it was one lousy applicant after another."
Dejected, they return to Moe's, when they hear a beautiful Irish voice
singing from the bathroom.  They're all amazed, and wonder who it is.
After a burp, it can only be one person...

 Homer: Barney!  How'd you like to sing for our group?
Barney: [On the bathroom floor] Sure, why not?  [searching] Now, where's
        me toothpick?
-- Maybe it fell in the toilet, 

Wiggum will not accept defeat.  He rallies the good citizens of
Springfield behind his cause.  They chant angrily at the new foursome as
the Chief laughs.  The minute Barney breaks into, "Sweet Adeline", the
audience flip flops, and cheer with delight.  Wiggum slinks away.

  Moe: Those girls you paid to scream are doing a great job.
Nigel: _I_ didn't pay any girls to scream.
  Moe: Huh?!
-- They really mean it?, 

After the show, the quartet members are elated.  And yet...

Skinner: Only one question remains, gentlemen...what do we call
         ourselves?
  Nigel: How about, "Handsome Homer Simpson Plus Three?"
 Barney: I like it!
    Apu: Wait, I do not.
Skinner: Er, um, we need a name that's witty at first, but that seems
         less funny each time you hear it.
    Apu: How about, "The Be Sharps?"
          [Everyone laughs loud at first, then less, then the laughter
         tapers off]
Skinner: Perfect!
-- Important group naming criteria, 

The four of them reach into the center of the circle with one hand, palm
face down, and touch hands as a gesture of solidarity.  Chief Wiggum
adds his hand to the pile, saying, "You can't blame a guy for trying."
When the foursome glare at him, he laughs sheepishly, then places them
under arrest.

[End of Act One.  Time: 9:12]

On the drive home, everyone compares acquisitions from the swap meet.

Homer: What'd you kids get?
 Bart: I bought this cool pencil holder.
Homer: Heh heh, far out man.  I haven't seen a bong in years.
-- But it _could_ hold pencils, 

Marge is unhappy about the way things went for her.

Marge: [dejected] No one bought a wishbone necklace.
Homer: Well, one of us made some money!  I sold a guy our spare tire.
        [A tire on the car blows out] D'oh!
-- Didn't think we'd need it, 

Marge walks off into the distance, twelve miles to the gas station.

Homer: Well, it'll be a long time before your mother gets back with the
       tire, so why don't I tell you more of the story?
-- A tire blows out on the Simpson car, 

Homer sits at the piano in the Simpson house, trying to write a song.

Homer: [plays some chords, then sings tentatively]
       There was nothing in Al Capone's vault,
       But it wasn't Geraldo's fault...
        [spoken] D'oh!
-- Composing is harder than you might think, "Homer's Barbershop
    Quartet"

Marge: Look what I got!  Now people will stop intentionally ramming our
       car.
-- Marge buys a "Baby On Board" sign, 

The sign gives Homer an idea for a song.

Homer: Hmm, "Baby on Board..." [sings]
       Baby On Board,
       Something something, Burt Ward...
        [spoken] This thing writes itself!
-- Homer "Amadeus" Simpson, 

The Be Sharps sing Homer's composition in the studio.  When they finish
Nigel tells them they've just recorded their first number one.  The four
are ecstatic.

Homer: [excited] Wait till I tell Marge!
Nigel: [with consternation] Oh, yes...Bouffant Betty.  Well, I would
       prefer if we kept your marriage a secret.  You see, a lot of
       women are going to want to have _sex_ with you, and, er, we want
       them to think they _can_.
Homer: Well, if I explain it to Marge _that_ way, I'm sure she'll
       understand.
        [scene change to the Simpson home]
Marge: [cries loudly]
Homer: [trying to placate her] C'mon, honey!  It'll only be until we
       finish our tour of Sweden.
-- Homer, master comforter, 

Abe hears the Be Sharps on the radio, and proudly informs Jasper that
Homer is in the group.  Jasper tells him Paul Harvey's on, and Abe
switches stations quickly.  They catch the tail end of the tale of Roy
Cohn.

Captain McAllister is fighting a ferocious sea squid, when "Baby On
Board" comes on the radio.  He stops brandishing his harpoon.

Ah, Squiddy!  I got nothing against ye.  I just heard there was gold in
yer belly.  Ha ha har, ha ha ha har!
-- Captain McAllister vs. the Sea Squid, 

Marge and Homer listen to the end of the song on the radio.

Marge: Homer, you're going to be famous!
Homer: Yeah, but I'm not gonna let it change our lives.  I'll be the
       same loving father I've always been.
Marge: Hmm, have you seen Bart?
Homer: Ehh, I stuck him somewhere.
-- It's started already, 

Homer buys his dad a new pink Cadillac with his new fortune.
Unfortunately, Abe's heart can't quite handle the joy.

The Be Sharps disembark at JFK airport in New York City.  A large crowd
is on hand to greet them.  The press is there too, ready for a press
conference.

Reporter: I have a question for Apu de Beaumarchais.  Isn't it true that
          you're really an Indian?
     Apu: By the many arms of Vishnu, I swear it is a lie.
Reporter: Barney!  How did you join the group?
  Barney: They found me on the men's room floor.
           [Everyone laughs, but a tear rolls down Barney's cheek]
Reporter: Principal Skinner, you've been referred to as "the funny one."
          Is that reputation justified?
 Skinner: [seriously] Yes.  Yes, it is.
           [Everyone laughs]
-- Funny to look at perhaps, 

The group performs in the harbor near the Statue of Liberty in front of
an unappreciative Ronald Reagan, with Nancy in tow.

Homer: We'd like to dedicate this next number to a very special woman.
       She's a hundred years old, and she weighs over two hundred...
       tons.
  Man: This enormous woman will devour us all!  Aah!  [jumps into water]
Homer: Er, I meant the statue...
-- Used a bong lately?, 

Chief Wiggum sits discontentedly at home in bed, as Johnny Carson and
Joan Rivers poke fun at his now dead singing career.  He even shoots at
his TV in his depression, but misses.  His wife admonishes him for not
using the remote, {but he whines that he can't find it.  She tells him
to check his holster,} and he finds it there.  Switching channels to
Joan Rivers, who denigrates him, he cracks the tube by throwing his gun
at it.

Marge has now returned and is changing the tire.  Homer explains all
that was now needed was the approval of record company lowlives.  The
29th annual Grammys has David Crosby presenting the award for
"Outstanding Soul, Spoken Word, or Barbershop Album of the Year".  "And
the winner is...the Be Sharps!"  The four leave their seats and walk
onto the stage.

Barney: David Crosby?  You're my hero!
 David: Oh, you like my music?
Barney: [surprised] You're a musician?
-- Birds of a feather, 

At the party afterwards, Homer gets the greatest thrill of his life.

George: Hello, Homer!  I'm George Harrison.
 Homer: [incredulous] Oh my God.  Oh my God!  Where did you get that
        brownie?
George: Over there.  There's a big pile of them.
 Homer: [Laughs crazily, then devours a whole bunch]
         [satisfied] Oh, ma-an...
         [devours more]
George: Well, what a nice fellow.
-- You ain't seen nothin' yet, 

In the hotel room, Homer is talking to Lisa on the phone.

Homer: Lisa, did you see the Grammys?
 Lisa: You beat Dexy's Midnight Runners.
Homer: Well, you haven't heard the last of them.
-- Oh yeah?, 

Homer hangs up, then becomes pensive for a moment, then sighs.  He seems
depressed.  Room service brings him some champagne, and when he looks
for a tip, he gives the bellhop his Grammy instead.  The bellhop is
excited at first, but when he sees it's a Grammy, he throws it off the
balcony in disgust.  A man on the street tosses it back up, only to hit
Homer on the head.

[End of Act Two.  Time: 15:43]

In the living room, Homer shows Bart and Lisa his "Be Sharps Stuff" box.

 Lisa: Wow, look at all this Be Sharps merchandise.  Lunch boxes...
       coffee mugs...funny foam...[squirts some on Homer]
Homer: [angrily] They took the foam off the market because they found
       out it was poisonous, but if you ask me, if you're dumb enough to
       eat it, you deserve to die.
        [looks over] Bart!
 Bart: [through a mouth full of foam, guiltily] What?
-- A closed mouth gathers no feet, 

 Lisa: I can't believe you're not still popular.
 Bart: What'd you do?  Screw up like the Beatles and say you were bigger
       than Jesus?
Homer: All the time!  That was the title of our second album.
-- They meant "more popular", not "bigger", 

Homer: We were about to learn an iron law of show business: what goes up
       must come down.
 Lisa: What about Bob Hope?  He's been consistently popular for over
       fifty years.
 Bart: So's Sinatra.
Homer: Well, anyway, we were all getting tired of --
 Lisa: Dean Martin still packs 'em in.
 Bart: Ditto Tom Jones.
Homer: Shut up!
-- Counterexample, schmounterexample, 

Marge explains how she tried to compensate for Homer's absence when he
was on the road.  She made a dummy of homer out of a coffee can, some
balloons, dish gloves, and a few other household items, and played a
tape of Homer's voice to the young Bart and Lisa.  It didn't quite work
as well as she'd hoped, though.

"Meanwhile, the group was having problems of its own," Homer explains.
He, Apu, and Skinner are shown in the studio with stubble on their
faces, singing off-key.

       [Homer, Skinner, and Apu sing]
       For all the latest medical poop
       Call Surgeon General C. Everett Koop.
       Poo poo pa-doop.
  Apu: This is worse than your song about Mr. T.
Homer: I pity the fool who doesn't like...he.
-- At least it rhymes, 

Homer asks where Barney is, and Seymour tells him Barney is with his new
girlfriend, the "Japanese conceptual artist".  Barney walks in with her,
and opines that he's worried barbershop is becoming stagnant.  He plays
them his "bold new direction" demo tape, which consists of repetitions
of a female voice saying, "Number eight," followed by a belch.  {Two of
the "Number eight"s are cut in syndication.}  Apu and Seymour roll their
eyes.

Things were really over for the four when "US" magazine rated them as
"not hot" in the "What's Hot and What's Not" survey.  "We all went our
separate ways."  Skinner goes back to Springfield Elementary.

Skinner: Well, William, I'm back!  So...how did you spend your summer?
  Willy: I made millions in software and lost it at the track.  Ach!
-- Who knew?, 

Apu takes his old job at the Kwik-E-Mart back.

  Apu: It may not be glamorous, but it's good, honest work.
Woman: How much is this quart of milk?
  Apu: Twelve dollars.
-- The best policy, 

Barney reoccupies his seat at Moe's.

   Moe: Hey, Barney!  What'll it be?
Barney: I'd like a beer, Moe!
  Yoko: I'd like a single plum floating in perfume served in a man's
        hat.
   Moe: [reaching under bar] Here you go.
-- And you thought he couldn't mix drinks, 

Homer takes his job back at the power plant.

Homer: Hey, fellows, I'm back!
 Carl: Oh, that's great.  Your replacement was getting tired.
        [shot of a chicken in Homer's chair, pecking the controls]
       Hey, Queenie, you can go now!
Homer: I'll give her a good home.
        [scene shifts back to Bart and Lisa, centered on Homer's
       stomach]
       And I did.
-- Always keeps his promises, 

 Bart: Man, that's some story!
 Lisa: But there are still a few things I don't get.  Like, how come we
       never heard about this until today?
 Bart: Yeah, and what happened to the money you made?
 Lisa: Why haven't you hung up your gold records?
 Bart: Since when could you write a song?
Homer: [laughs] There are perfectly good answers to those questions.
       But they'll have to wait for another night.  Now off to bed!
-- Never a continuity error, 

Homer looks at the old "Meet the Be Sharps" album wistfully, then picks
up the phone.  In the next scene, he walks out a door on the roof of
Moe's tavern, where Apu, Seymour, and Barney wait for him.

The four break into "Baby On Board," and all the passers-by stop to
listen.  No one pays any attention to "Human Fly", who stayed up all
night dyeing his underwear.  A newsie hocks a paper to a man by
pretending it contained an article about the Be Sharps.  George Harrison
drives by in his limo, rolls down the window, and glances up at the four
of them..."It's been done," he says, and drives off.  Even Wiggum and
Lou seem impressed at the display, until Wiggum tells Lou to get the
tear gas.

[End of Act Three.  Time: 20:19]

Over the closing credits, Homer says, "I'd like to thank you on behalf
of the group, and I hope we passed the audition."  Everyone laughs,
including Barney.  After the laughter dies down, Barney says, "I don't
get it."
 EPISODE TITLE: Cape Feare


EPISODE SUMMARY: 
[Syndication cuts are marked in curly braces "{}" and are courtesy of
Frederic Briere.]

On the TV...

Announcer: Ladies and gentlemen, it's "Up Late with McBain".  I'm your
           announcer, Corporal Obergruppenfuehrer Wolfcastle.  And
           heeere's McBain!
   McBain: Ja, thank you, ja, that's nice.  Let's say hello to my music
           guy, Skoey.  [Skoey bows] That is some outfit, Skoey.  It
           makes you look like a homosexual.
            [Audience boos]
           Whoa, maybe you all are homosexuals too!
     Bart: This is horrible.
     Lisa: The FOX network has sunk to a new low.
-- Thank God for FOX, 

Marge comes in with the mail.

Marge: Lisa, you got a letter.
 Lisa: It's from my pen-pal Anya!  [reads]
 Anya: [voice over] Dear Lisa, as I write this, I am very sad.  Our
       president has been overthrown and
        [voice changes to that of a man]
       replaced by the benevolent general Krull.  All hail Krull and his
       glorious new regime!  Sincerely, Little Girl.
-- Hmm, sudden tone change, 

Bart gets a letter as well.  Except it's only five words: "I'M GOING TO
KILL YOU", scrawled in thick red ink.  Bart quakes.  Scene switches to a
pair of hands, the left one holding a pointed knife.  The knife is used
to prick a finger on the right hand, drawing blood.  A "Things to do"
list shows "Threaten Bart" and "Do laundry" written in blood, and both
items get checked off -- in blood.  As an afterthought, "Buy corn
holders" is added to the list.

Just then, an Itchy and Scratchy cartoon, "Spay Anything", comes on the
TV.  Itchy stands in front of a sign, "WE PAY YOUR PETS $75", at
"Itchy's Cat Hospital", and Scratchy walks by.  Envisioning a quick
profit, Scratchy rushes into the building.  Itchy follows him in, to
reveal an "S" in front of "PAY" that was formerly concealed.  Scratchy
is shackled onto a table by two big canine orderlies, and Dr. Itchy
turns on the spay ray!  Slowly, slowly, the ray inches closer to
Scratchy's doodle.  Frantically, he glances over and sees the plug
nearby!  Magically, his tongue extends towards the plug, pulling it from
the wall in the nick of time.  Just then, Dr. Itchy returns and
reinserts the plug.  The spay ray slices Scratchy to bits which slide
off the table...Scratchy's eyes blink twice, convulsively, as the life
seeps from his body.

Lisa is very amused, but Bart feels the specter of the letter writer
cast a shadow over his heart.

Homer reads another letter and panics for a moment, but then he realizes
it's for Bart: "DIE BART DIE", again in red ink.  Many letters are shown
laid out on the table, all in red ink, except for one conspicuous
letter, which says "I KILL YOU SCUM" in black ink instead of red.  Homer
confesses having written it after Bart somehow put a tattoo reading
"WIDE LOAD" on Homer's butt.  Everyone laughs hard, even Marge.  Nelson
happens to be at the window, and he laughs too.

But who'd want to hurt me?  I'm this century's Dennis the Menace.
-- Bart, 

Homer suggests, "It's probably the person you least suspect," but Lisa
doesn't think much of that idea.

 Abe: I say we call Matlock.  He'll find the culprit.  It's probably
      that evil Gavin MacLeod or George "Goober" Lindsay.
Bart: [dismissively] Grampa, Matlock's not real.
 Abe: Neither are my teeth, but I can still eat corn on the cob, if
      someone cuts it off and smushes it into a fine paste.  Now that's
      good eatin'!
-- Matlock and corn: good by themselves, twice as good together, "Cape
    Feare"

Um, I checked around.  The girls are calling you "fatty-fat fat fat",
and Nelson's planning to pull down your pants, but...nobody's trying to
kill ya.
-- Milhouse the informer to Bart, 

Just then, Nelson pulls down Bart's pants, and a horde of kids suddenly
appear, chanting "Fatty-fat fat fat!" in unison.

[cheerfully] All right, this is dedicated to Bart Simpson, with the
message, "I am coming to kill you slowly _and_ painfully."
-- Marty, the wacky radio DJ, 

          [Scene shows Marge in the kitchen]
   Marge: [threateningly] Bart, I am going to _get_ you...[brandishes
          some scissors]
    Bart: [gasps]
   Marge: [cheerfully] ...some ice cream at the store, since I'm saving
          so much money on Diet Cola!  [holds up a coupon]
           [Scene switches to Flanders outside]
Flanders: [threateningly] Say your prayers, Simpson...[brandishes a
          glove with knives on the fingers]
    Bart: [gasps]
Flanders: [cheerfully] ...because the schools can't force you like they
          should!  [clips the hedge] Maude, these new finger razors make
          hedge trimming as much fun as sitting through church.
           [Scene switches to Bart's classroom]
    Edna: [threateningly] You're going to be my murder victim, Bart...
    Bart: [gasps]
    Edna: [sweetly] ...in our school production of "Lizzie Borden",
          starring Martin Prince as Lizzie.
           [Shot of Martin in drag]
  Martin: [with an axe] Forty whacks with a wet noodle, Bart!
-- They're all out to get you, 

Marge appeals to Chief Wiggum for action, but the Chief is reluctant.

Wiggum: I'd like to help you ma'am, but, heh heh, I'm afraid there's no
        law against mailing threatening letters.
 Marge: [indignantly] I'm pretty sure there is.
Wiggum: Hah!  The day I take cop lessons from Ma Kettle --
   Lou: Hey, she's right, Chief.  [shows him "Springfield Law"]
Wiggum: Well, shut my mouth.  It's _also_ illegal to put squirrels down
        your pants for the purposes of gambling.
         [Shot of Eddie the cop with squirrels running around in his
        pants, and a bunch of cops watching and laughing]
        Boys, knock it off!
-- The perks of being a man in blue, 

Meanwhile, Lisa's been thinking.

Lisa: Bart, I figured it out!  Who's someone you've been making
      irritating phone calls to for years?
Bart: Linda Lavin?
Lisa: No, someone who _didn't_ deserve it.
-- As long as it's cheaper than 555-CORY, 

It's Moe!  Lisa calls up, tells Moe that they know he's behind it, and
curtly informs him to knock it off.  Moe assures her he'll take care of
it.  He releases the pandas he's been holding captive.

Bart thinks more on his predicament.  "You're out there somewhere," he
says, but implores, "Where?  Where?"  That "somewhere" is the
Springfield State Prison, and the someone is...

...Sideshow Bob!

Bob is writing another letter, "SEE YOU SOON BART".  Afterward, he
decides to write to "Reader's Digest".

  Bob: [narrating aloud] Dear "Life in these United States", a funny
       thing happened to me...uh...[faints]
Snake: Use a pen, Sideshow Bob.
-- The pen is mightier than the sword -- except when it runs out of
    blood, 

[End of Act One.  Time: 6:08]

At the parole hearings, the committee grants parole to Snake, the
reformed convict.  Next up is "Bob Terwilliger, a. k. a.  Sideshow Bob."
Sideshow Bob says goodbye to his cellmate.

  Bob: Take care, Snake.  May the next time we meet be under more...
       _felicitous_ circumstances.
Snake: [not understanding] Guh?
  Bob: Take care.
Snake: Buh.
-- Never made it to grade 10, 

In the court room, Sideshow Bob's parole hearing is underway.  Chief
Wiggum takes the stand.

Wiggum: [miffed] Sideshow Bob has no decency.  He called me "Chief
        Piggum!"
         [everyone laughs]
        Heh, now I get it.  That's good.
-- Guess you _didn't_ have to be there, 

Selma's up next, and she explains, "Sideshow Bob tried to kill me on our
honeymoon."  The crowd whispers among themselves, shocked at the
revelation.  But Bob's lawyer asks craftily, "How many people in this
court are thinking of killing her right now?"  A few spectators glumly
put their hands up.  "Be honest," he admonishes, and many more hands go
up, even a priest's.  Even Patty raises her hand: "Aw, she's always
leaving the toilet seat up."

 Lawyer: Robert, if released, would you pose any threat to one Bart
         Simpson?
    Bob: [barely in control] Bart Simpson?  Ha!  The spirited little
         scamp who twice foiled my evil schemes and [maliciously] sent
         me to this dank, urine-soaked hellhole?
Officer: Uh, we object to the term "urine-soaked hellhole" when you
         could have said, "peepee-soaked heckhole".
    Bob: Cheerfully withdrawn.
-- We aim to please, 

But the lawyer presses on.

 Lawyer: But what about that tattoo on your chest?  Doesn't it say, "Die
         Bart, Die?"
    Bob: [conciliatorily] No, that's German for "The Bart, The."
          [The spectators laugh, understanding]
Officer: No one who speaks German could be an evil man.
-- Remember World War II?, 

Sideshow Bob's parole is granted.  With his new-found freedom, Bob
decides to catch a movie, "Ernest Goes Somewhere Cheap."  Showing
flagrant disregard for the other patrons, Bob smokes a cigar openly and
cackles loudly at the inanity on the big screen.

The Simpsons, too, are at the movie.  Marge is nonplussed: "That man is
so rude."  Homer concurs, moving his own cigar deftly with his lips from
the right side of his mouth to the left.  Homer taps Bob on the
shoulder, warning him, "If you don't mind, we're trying to watch the
movie!"  Just then, Ernest gets his head stuck in a toilet, and Homer
can't contain his mirth.  Now it's Bob's turn to be nonplussed.  He
turns angrily to Homer to berate him.

Bart+Lisa: Aah!  Sideshow Bob!
     Bart: _You_ wrote me those letters.
    Marge: You awful man!  Stay away from my son.
      Bob: Oh, I'll stay away from your son, all right.  [evilly] Stay
           away...forever!
    Homer: [quaking] No!
      Bob: Wait a minute, that's no good.
            [Starts to walk away, then runs back]
           Wait!  I've got a good one now.  Marge, say, "Stay away from
           my son," again.
    Marge: [angrily] No!
      Bob: [groaning] Oh...
-- I hate it when that happens, 

Bob angrily prepares to carry out some dastardly plan.  He pumps iron
and even participates in a TV exercise program, turning, flexing,
shaking, and bouncing.

Meanwhile at the Simpson home, Chief Wiggum helps the family set up an
elaborate network of trip strings attached to a Krusty doll.  He assures
them the trap is infallible.

  Wiggum: Now Sideshow Bob can't get in without _me_ knowing.  And once
          a man is in your home, anything you do to him is nice and
          legal.
   Homer: [nefariously] Is that so?  [calls out window] Oh, Flanders!
          Won't you join me in my kitchen?  Heh, heh, heh...
  Wiggum: Er, it doesn't work if you invite him.
Flanders: [effusively] Heidily hey!
   Homer: [truculently] Go home!
Flanders: [congenially] Toodily doo!
-- Coulda worked, though, 

Homer decides to enlist the help of a local vigilante.

Man: Now don't you fret.  When I'm through, he won't set foot in this
     town again.  I can be very, _very_ persuasive.  [reloads his gun]
      [Scene change to a bar]
Man: [whining] C'mon, leave town!
Bob: No.
Man: I'll be your friend?
Bob: No.
Man: Aw, you're mean!
-- How to Win Arguments and Influence People, 

Sideshow Bob becomes more daring.  He drives through the neighborhood in
an ice cream truck, naming the people he won't kill.  When he gets to
the Simpson house, he mentions every name except Bart's, even "that
little baby Simpson".  Homer is overjoyed his life won't be snuffed out,
and he races up to impart the good news to Bart, but Bart only looks
glum.

Finally, the Simpsons resort to the FBI's Witness Relocation Program.
They promise the Simpsons a new name, a new job, and a whole new
identity.  Homer fantasizes about becoming John Elway, but Marge isn't
sure it's such a good idea.  Homer tries to convince her: "It's a chance
to turn around all our stinkin' lives."  Bart has his own ideas for a
new identity.

 Bart: I'll be Gus, the lovable chimney-sweep.  Clean as a whistle,
       sharp as a thistle, best in all Westminster.  Yeah!
Homer: Shut up, boy.
-- So much for _that_ new identity, 

The agents being suggesting possible new locations for the family.

Agent: We have places your family can hide in peace and security: Cape
       Fear, Terror Lake, New Horrorfield, Screamville --
Homer: [enthusiastically] Ooh, Ice Creamville!
Agent: Er, no, Screamville.
Homer: [scared] Aah!
-- A fertile imagination, 

One agent suggests a new identity for Homer.

Agent: Tell you what, sir.  From now on, you'll be, uh, Homer Thompson
       at Terror Lake.  Let's just practise a bit, hmm?  When I say,
       "Hello, Mr. Thompson," you'll say, "Hi."
Homer: Check.
Agent: Hello, Mr. Thompson.
Homer: [stares blankly]
Agent: Remember now, your name is Homer Thompson.
Homer: I gotcha.
Agent: Hello, Mr. Thompson.
Homer: [stares blankly]
        [A long time later]
Agent: [sighs in frustration] Now, when I say, "Hello, Mr. Thompson,"
       and press down on your foot, you smile and nod.
Homer: No problem.
Agent: Hello, Mr. Thompson!  [stomps on Homer's foot a few times]
Homer: [stares blankly]
        [to other agent] I think he's talking to _you_.
-- Some things just won't stick, 

The details are finally arranged.  The FBI agents give Homer the keys to
a new convertible.  Lisa is delighted to discover "The FBI Light Opera
Society Sings the Complete Gilbert and Sullivan" series of cassettes in
the car.  The whole family sings joyously along to "Three Little Maids"
from "The Mikado".  Little do they know that Sideshow Bob has strapped
himself under their car...of course, the ride isn't so easy for the
villain, what with the speed bumps and scalding coffee Homer throws over
the side of the car.  Even worse...

Homer: Hey kids, wanna drive through that cactus patch?
 Bart: Yeah!
 Lisa: Yeah!
  Bob: [disguising his voice from under the car] No!
Homer: Well, two against one!
-- That's democracy, 

Homer drives recklessly through the cacti, much to Sideshow Bob's
chagrin.

[End of Act Two.  Time: 12:52]

We see an intro sequence very similar to that from "The Simpsons",
except it's for a show called "The Thompsons".  Instead of showing
Springfield looming over the horizon, we see a sign saying, "Welcome to
Terror Lake" and a pier with houseboats.  A red convertible skids to a
halt, and the Thompson family jump out and rush into one of the
houseboat.  Inside, they all rush to sit on a couch, but once they do, a
load of fish crashes through the roof and covers them.

Homer exclaims, "Wow, a houseboat!"  He notes that a great advantage of
houseboats is, if you don't like your neighbors, you can pull up the
anchor and sail some place else.  All the neighbors do just this while
the family laughs.

Sideshow Bob has meanwhile extricated himself from under the car.  He
has the misfortune of stepping onto ground where someone has left a
bunch of rakes lying around.  He steps on several with his oversized
feet; the bone-crunching smash of the rake handle flying into his face
makes him groan.  {The last two rakes he steps on are cut in
syndication.}

Marge is concerned about the location of Santa's Little Helper, but
Homer has resourcefully tied him up out back -- to a post that has been
sunk into the floor of Terror Lake.

Marge: [ruefully] We've left it all behind.  How can you make a clean
       break with your life?
Homer: Relax, Marge, I tied up all the loose ends before we left.
        [Scene change to Simpsons' old house]
  Abe: [knocking] Hello-o?  Hello-o!  You have my pills!  Hello-o?
        [meekly] I'm cold, and there are wolves after me.
        [Howling is heard in the distance]
-- All the loose ends except one, 

Bart walks down the street, when he hears a voice say coldly, "Hello,
Bart."  It's Sideshow Bob strapped to the bottom of another car.  Bart
asks what Bob wants, but Bob plays innocent: "Surely there's no harm in
laying the middle of a public street?"  Bob didn't figure on the parade
that comes marching along, complete with elephants, as "Terror Lake
celebrates Hannibal crossing the Alps."  Bart rushes home to tell his
parents.

Homer: [cracks a beer] Ahh!
 Bart: Mom, Dad, I saw Sideshow Bob and he threatened to kill me!
Homer: Bart, don't interrupt!
Marge: Homer, this is serious!
Homer: Oh, it is not.
-- 

Sideshow Bob sits in his motel room, plotting his revenge.

[dictating while writing] Roman numeral three: surprise boy in bed...
[sips his tea] ...and, er, disembowel him!
No, I don't like that "bowel" in there.  [erases it] Gut him!  Ah, le
mot juste.
-- Sideshow Bob plots his revenge, 

Bart tosses and turns in bed, unable to sleep.  He eyes pop open as his
door opens stealthily and a knife blade appears.  A madman jumps in,
yelling incoherently, and Bart screams.  But it turns out to be Homer,
offering Bart a warm brownie.  Bart admonishes Homer for frightening him
so, and Homer realizes, "Oh, the Sideshow Bob thing."  He apologizes,
kisses Bart and leaves.

No sooner has Bart closed his eyes that another madman springs into the
room!  But again, it's just Homer, asking Bart if he wants to see his
new chainsaw and hockey mask.

The lights go out, one by one, on the Thompson's houseboat.  A single
hand appears from the water, grasping at the railing on the boat, as
Sideshow Bob pulls himself aboard, only to step on another rake that
someone has left carelessly lying about.  He tosses it over the side,
brandishes a machette, and cuts the boat loose from the dock.

He walks into Bart's room and greets him.  Bart calls out to his
parents, but Sideshow Bob has tied everyone up -- even Santa's Little
Helper and Snowball II.  Lisa sees Homer drooling and snoring and
mistakenly thinks he's been drugged.

Sideshow Bob advances menacingly.  Bart opens the window behind him and
jumps out just as Bob's machette whicker-snickers through the air,
slicing a pillow in two.  Bart runs desperately from one end of the boat
to the other, only to find the water inhabited by alligators and
electric eels.  At last, Bart is trapped.

 Bob: Well, Bart...any last requests?
Bart: Well, there is one, but...nah.
 Bob: [curious] No, go on.
Bart: Well, you have such a beautiful voice.
 Bob: [arrogantly] Guilty as charged.
Bart: Uh huh.  Anyway, I was wondering if you could sing the entire
      score of the "H.M.S.  Pinafore".
 Bob: Very well, Bart.  I shall send you to heaven before I send you to
      hell.
-- 

Bob grabs Bart, sits him down, and breaks into song: "We sail the ocean
blue/And our saucy ship's a beauty./We are sober men, and true/And
attentive to our duty..." What Bob doesn't realize is that shortly
before, they passed a sign reading, "Springfield 15 Mi."  If Bart can
stall Bob long enough...

Bart eats popcorn as Bob sings "I'm called little Buttercup..." The two
do a duet: "What, never?  No, never.  What, never?  [together] Hardly
ever!  He's hardly ever sick at sea..." Bob finishes off with "For He Is
an Englishman", and the audience gives him a standing ovation and some
flowers.  But the fun is over.

   Bob: And now [draws his sword] the final curtain...[walks towards
        Bart]
         [The boat hits a rock and Bob is sent flying]
         [Chief Wiggum and other policemen are on shore in their
        bathrobes]
Wiggum: [cocks his gun] Hold it right there, Sideshow Bob.  You're under
        arrest.
   Bob: By Lucifer's beard!
Wiggum: Uh, yeah.  It's a good thing you drifted by this brothel.
-- Depends on who you ask, 

Bart explains how he tricked Sideshow Bob.

 Bart: I knew I had to buy some time.  So I asked him to sing the score
       from the "H.M.S.  Pinafore".
Homer: Ooh, a plan fiendishly clever in its in-tric-asies.
-- Homer, literary scholar, 

Bart orders the police to dispose of the crook.

  Bart: Take him away, boys.
Wiggum: Hey, I'm the chief here!  Bake him away, toys.
   Lou: What'd you say, chief?
Wiggum: [quietly] Do what the kid says.
-- Yeah, what he said, 

At last, the family can return home.  Unfortunately, without Abe's
pills, his hair has grown long, he's wearing lipstick, and he's sprouted
generous breasts.  Marge tells Bart to run upstairs to get Grampa's
medicine, but Jasper has his own ideas: courting the fair young maiden.

[End of Act Three.  Time: 19:59]

Over the credits, Abe tries to tell Jasper what happened, but when
Jasper mentions his Steve and Eydie tickets, Abe decides the truth can
wait.  "I'm all yours!" he exclaims joyously, and kisses his new friend.
 EPISODE TITLE: Homer Goes to College


EPISODE SUMMARY: 
[Syndication cuts are marked in curly braces "{}" and are courtesy of
Ricardo Lafaurie and Frederic Briere.]

It's another lazy day at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant.  Homer
sits snoring at his desk, his old, faithful dog snoozing in a chair next
to him.  Lenny has craftily constructed a hammock for himself in another
room.

In his sleep, Homer rests his head on the control panel in front of him
-- directly on the "PLANT DESTRUCT: PLEASE DO NOT PUSH" button.  The
control room becomes awash in the red glow of emergency lights, and the
automated female voice says, "Core meltdown in ten seconds...nine..."
Homer's dog wakes up, hears the voice, and pulls the reset lever with
his mouth.  The voice announces, "Meltdown averted...good boy."

Mr. Burns, too, is asleep in his chair, its back to his wall of
monitors.  Yes, even the people on the monitors are asleep too.
Smithers sleeps, curled up beside Burns' chair.  His leg twitches, and
he moans softly in his sleep.

Outside, in the parking lot, the Nuclear Inspection Van recreational
vehicle pulls up.  Three white hard-hatted, lab-jacketed inspectors jump
out and press the buzzer at the entrance to the plant.

Agent 1: [presses the buzzer]
  Burns: [awakening, over the intercom] Mmm...hmm...what?  How dare you
         disturb me during nap time.
Agent 1: We're from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.  This is a
         surprise test of worker competence.
  Burns: There must be some mistake.  We, er, we make cookies here: Mr.
         Burns' Olde-Fashioned Good-Time Extra-Chewy --
Agent 2: [to Agent 3] Get the axe.
-- We've done this before, 

Smithers and Burns watch from the window as the inspectors lead some
plant employees into their vehicle.

   Burns: The watchdog of public safety...is there any lower form of
          life?
Smithers: Don't worry sir, I rounded up our less gifted employees and
          led them into the basement.
           [Shot of the basement with Homer and two other guys]
  Bernie: Duh, Homer, why are we down here?
   Homer: Aw, geez.  I told you, Bernie: to guard the bee!
     Man: [whining] But why?
   Homer: Aw, you guys are pathetic.  No wonder Smithers made me head
          bee-guy.
           [Homer kicks the jar accidentally, smashing it, and the bee
          escapes]
  Bernie: Duh, he's gettin' away.
     Man: Oh, we did bad!
-- No recess for you, 

The inspectors want to test Homer's competence next, but Smithers
apologizes for him, saying, "He couldn't _bee_ here."  Burns fobs them
off with some excuse about Homer chairing a conference on nuclear
fission in Geneva.  Unfortunately, Homer jumps up through a manhole
cover just then, exclaiming, "The bee bit my bottom!  Now my bottom's
big!"

The inspectors put Homer in the van.

Agent 2: Homer, this is an exact replica of your work station.
  Homer: [moans]
Agent 2: Now we're going to simulate a power surge in core sector eight.
  Homer: What the hell are you talking about?
-- This won't look good on a resume, 

Homer is despondent.

  Homer: What do I do?  What do I do?  In the name of God you've got to
         tell me!  [sobbing]
Agent 2: Relax, it's just a simulator.  Nothing can go wrong.
  Homer: [sotto voce] Just poke blindly at the controls until they let
         you go.
-- It's worked before, 

Homer begins doing just that, but something goes horribly wrong.  "This
can't be happening!" exclaims one of the inspectors, as the van begins
to glow green and sink into the ground.  Panic ensues at the plant.
Burns decides to try to get away in his escape pod.  He activates the
entrance to the pod, jumps in, and slams the door shut.  Smithers
implores, "For the love of God, sir, there are two seats!" but Burns
likes to put his feet up.  The pod takes off, but doesn't even come
close to reaching escape velocity.  Instead, it crashes into the street
and continues bouncing down it in a crumpled ball.

A glowing green Homer rises out of the hole left where the van used to
be, growling and fearsome.  "Must destroy mankind," he intones, but the
alarm on his watch goes off, reminding him that it's lunch time.  He
shakes off his radioactivity and bounds off to eat.

The agents watch the detox team spray the hole in the parking lot with a
foamy sealant.

Agent 2: I'm still not sure how he caused the meltdown.  There wasn't
         any nuclear material in the truck!
  Burns: Oh, very well, it's time for your bribe.
         Now, you can either have the washer and dryer where the lovely
         Smithers is standing, or you can trade it all in for what's in
         this box.
-- I can't decide, Monty, 

One inspector wants the box, but the other inspector remembers her
ethics.  She explains that Burns can't make the problem go away just by
throwing money at it, but just then, Mayor Quimby walks by in a fur coat
labeled "$5000" saying that he he's decided there will be no
investigation.  He then leaves.

The inspectors tell Burns that Homer's job requires college training in
nuclear physics.  If he doesn't get Homer up to speed, they tell him,
they'll be forced to take legal action.  "Is that so?" asks Burns.  "I
have the feeling you'll be dropping the charges," he says, emphasizing
"dropping" as he pushes a red button on his desk.  A trap door springs
open, but it's nowhere near where the inspectors are standing.  "The
painters moved your desk," Smithers reminds him.

The doorbell rings at the Simpsons house, and Homer goes to answer it.

 Homer: [answers the door, sees Burns with his lawyers] Aah!
 Burns: Hello, Simpson.  My lawyers and I were in the neighborhood and
        thought we'd stop by.
 Marge: [nervously] Would you like to come in for tea and marshmallow
        squares?
         [The lawyers discuss it quietly amongst themselves]
Lawyer: Yes, he would.
-- Executive decision, 

At the table, Homer asks Burns to confirm that he must go to college.
Bart scoffs, asking Homer, "College?  Barber or Clown?"

   Burns: Remember, your job and the future of your family hinges on
          your successful completion of Nuclear Physics 101.
          Oh, and one more thing: [ominously] you must find the jade
          monkey before the next full moon.
Smithers: Actually sir, we found the jade monkey; it was in your glove
          compartment.
   Burns: And the road maps?  And ice scraper?
Smithers: They were in there too, sir.
   Burns: Ex-cellent!  It's all falling into place.
-- Now as long as there are no meddling kids..., 

That night, in bed, Marge expresses her support for the idea of Homer
going to college.  "You could learn so much," she thinks.  "Maybe you're
right," says Homer, "I did always want to go to college, {but fate stood
in the way."  He thinks back to high school, where his guidance
counselor tried to get him to sign an application, assuring him, "You're
a shoe-in," but Homer gets distracted by a dog with a ham outside.
Sighing, the counselor throws Homer's application away.}

{Back in the present, Homer is filling out college applications.  His
garbage bin is full of crumpled paper.}

Homer: [growls in frustration]
 Lisa: Dad, don't let these application essays throw you.  Let's see:
       "List your three favorite books and how they've influenced your
       life."
Homer: Is "TV Guide" a book?
 Lisa: No.
Homer: "Son of Sniglet"?
 Lisa: No.
Homer: Katherine Hepburn's "Me"?
 Lisa: No!
Homer: Oh, I suck.
-- "Reading Digest" counts, though, 

Homer slaves away at the applications.

Homer: [writing] "...It was the most I ever threw up, and it changed my
       life forever."
 Bart: You the man, Homer!
Homer: Thanks, boy!
-- What it is, 

For the crowning touch, Homer pastes his photo to the application.  The
one he chooses shows him cramming a birthday cake into his mouth, as
Marge looks on worriedly.

 Bart: I dunno, Dad: don't you have a better picture?
Homer: Relax.  A photo can't make any difference.
        [A man and a woman review applications, and they come across
       Homer's]
  Man: [looking at the photo] He looks crazy.
Woman: Agreed.  Reading his essay would only waste valuable seconds.
-- Next!, 

Bart watches TV at home.

Finally!  The great taste of Worcestershire Sauce in a soft drink.
Ah..."Steakie"!
-- A TV commercial, 

Homer walks in and preempts Bart's program for a show about college that
he really should watch.  The show is called "School of Hard Knockers",
and it stars Corey Masterson.

 Prez: [on TV] Dean Bitterman, I hope nothing unsavory happens during my
       visit.  As you know, I _am_ the President of the United States.
 Dean: Oh, don't worry.  I've expelled those rowdy members of Chugalug
       house.
Homer: [watching] Ohh, I hate that lousy Dean!
Corey: [on TV] Your Bra Bomb better work, Nerdlinger!
 Nerd: Hey!
        [Corey presses the plunger; an explosion occurs in the
       background]
        [Many colors of bras rain down on the Dean and the President]
 Dean: Corey?!  Don't worry, Mr. President, I --
        [looks over, sees the President dancing and enjoying himself]
       Mr. President!
 Prez: Lighten up, Bitterman...that youngster will make a perfect
       addition to my cabinet.  Secretary of Partying Down!
 Dean: [growls; a bra falls on his head]
Homer: [triumphant] Yes!  Take _that_, Bitterman.
-- College is _just_ like that, 

Marge brings in the mail: it has the decision letters from all the
colleges Homer applied to.  Sadly, none of them are letters of
acceptance.

 Bart: Well, Pop, what are you going to do?
Homer: [resolutely] Something I should have done a _long_ time ago.
        [long pause]
Marge: You don't know, do you?
Homer: [meekly] No, ma'am.
-- Homer's empty life, 

Burns thinks he has a solution.  He wants to use his power at
Springfield University, where he holds a chair.  But the meeting is more
difficult than he has foreseen.

  Man: I'm sorry, Mr. Burns, but I must object.  This Simpson is not
       qualified!
        [There are nods of agreement]
Burns: I see.  Well, you know, fellows, I look at the admissions board a
       lot like a baseball team.  You all like baseball, don't you?
        [Everyone assents]
       Yes, well, to have a successful baseball club, you need teamwork,
       [Smithers hands him a baseball bat] not some hot-dog admissions
       officer playing by his own rules!
        [Burns starts hitting the man in the head with almost no force]
  Man: [noticing] Er, excuse me, what are you doing?
Burns: I'm giving you the [grunt] beating of your life!
  Man: Look, if -- stop that!  -- you wanted him that badly, why didn't
       you just say so?
Burns: [collapses from exertion] Smithers, dismember the corpse and send
       his widow a corsage.
-- 

Homer is elated: Burns' tactic worked!

Homer: Woo-hoo!  I'm a college man!  I won't need my high school diploma
       any more!  [sets fire to it and starts singing]
       I am so smart!
       I am so smart!
       I am so smart!
       I am so smart!
       S-M-R-T!
       I mean, S-M-A-R-T...
-- You were saying?, 

The fire Homer sets quickly engulfs the diploma and begins spreading to
the wall.

[End of Act One.  Time: 8:07]

At last, it's...

Homer: My first day of college.  I wish my father was alive to see this.
  Abe: [springing up from the back seat] Hey!
Homer: How long have you been back there?
  Abe: [meekly] Three days!
-- That explains the smell, 

Marge parks the car in the parking lot, and as she does, Homer sees a
nerd walk by.

Homer: [yelling at a student] Neeeerd!
Marge: Homer, that isn't very nice.
Homer: Marge, try to understand.  There are two kinds of college
       students: jocks and nerds.  As a jock, it is my duty to give
       nerds a hard time.
        [A "jock" walks by]
       Hey pal!  Did you get a load of the nerd?
 Jock: [not understanding] Pardon me?
-- The times, they are a-changin', 

To meet some new friends, Homer takes Marge to the Freshman Mixer.
Glancing around, Homer sees a bowl of punch, and decides to help is
popularity.

  Homer: [spiking the punch] Heh heh, I'll be a campus hero.
          [Another student tastes the punch and spits it out]
Student: Attention, everyone: the punch has been spiked.
          [Everyone gasps]
         Don't worry.  Your parents have been called and will be here to
         pick you up shortly!
          [Everyone cheers]
-- Let's try plan two, 

Homer: Marge, someone squeezed all the life out of these kids.  And
       unless movies and TV have lied to me, it's a crusty, bitter old
       Dean!
 Dean: Hi there!  Hello, I'm Dean Peterson, but you can call me Bobby.
       I just want you to know if you ever feel stressed out from
       studying or whatever, I'm always up for some hackey sack.  Or,
       hey!  If you just want to come by and jam, I used to be the bass
       player for the Pretenders.  [plays a riff]
Homer: [bitterly] Boy, I can't wait to take some of the starch out of
       that stuffed shirt.
-- Character evaluation problems, 

On the first day of class, Homer sits at the back of the lecture hall.
The lecturer is an older man in a white lab coat, and he speaks with a
germanic accent.  "I see a lot of new faces," he says, "but, you know
the old saying: out with the old, in with the nucleus."  Everyone laughs
except Homer.  When the lecturer drops his cue cards by mistake, Homer's
mirth seems to know no bounds.  None of the other students see what he
finds so funny.

 Prof: {Now if anyone would like to stay, I'm going to hold a
       comprehensive review session after every class.}
Homer: {[waving] Do we have to?}
 Prof: {No --}
Homer: {Then kiss my curvy butt goood-bye!}
-- 

{Homer opts for chasing around a pair of squirrels with a stick instead
of staying for the (no doubt much needed) review session.}

{At home, Homer has altered his room to be more like that of a college
student.  He has posters of W. C. Fields, Einstein, and a ballerina's
feet on the wall, and he's made a makeshift bookshelf from four planks
and six cinderblocks.  He's listening to "Louie, Louie" on his stereo.}

 Marge: {Homer, we have a perfectly good bookcase.}
 Homer: {Yeah, but this is what they're doing on campus.  Besides, it
        isn't costing us: I swiped the cinderblocks from a construction
        site.
         [At the site, a worker walks forlorn up to his boss]}
Worker: {Sir, six cinderblocks are missing.}
  Boss: {There'll be no hospital, then.  I'll tell the children.}
-- 

Back in Nuclear Physics 101, the professor explains a high-tech piece of
equipment to the class.

 Prof: This proton accelerator destabilizes the atom in this chamber
       here, then propels it --
Homer: Uh, excuse me, Professor Brainiac, but I worked in a nuclear
       power plant for ten years, and, uh, I think I know how a proton
       accelerator works.
 Prof: Well, please, come down and show us.
Homer: All right, I will.
        [Everyone abandons the glowing green building]
        [Homer walks out, glowing green himself]
Homer: [to meltdown men] In there, guys.
  Men: Thanks, Homer.
-- If I didn't know better, I _might_ think you'd met him before, "Homer
    Goes to College"

The Dean is kind to Homer, despite the egregious nature of his screw-up.

 Dean: Homer, no one blames you for the accident, we simply feel you
       might benefit from outside tutoring.  I researched these names
       myself.  [hands him a list]
Homer: [to himself] Yeah, you've won this round, Dean...but the war
       isn't over.  [exits]
        [Dean's phone rings]
 Dean: Hello?
Homer: [disguising his voice] Hello, Dean!  You're a stupid-head.
 Dean: Homer, is that you?  [looks out his window]
Homer: [looks up, sees the Dean looking at him] Aah!
-- Thank God for Call Display, 

Homer wanders the college in search of room 222, where his tutors live.
He knocks on the door and is let in.  When he greets the three nerds,
who are tapping furiously at their keyboards, they answer in robotic
voices, "Intruder Alert", and laugh.

 Homer: Look, I'm supposed to get a physics tutor.
Nerd 1: Well, you've come to the right place then.  If there's one thing
        we know, it is science.
Nerd 2: And math.
Nerd 3: And the words to every Monty Python routine.
 Nerds: [in unison] We are the Knights Who Say...Ni!  Ni!  [laughter]
 Homer: Heh heh...Ni.
-- Homer's quest for a shrubbery, 

At dinner that night, Homer excitedly tells the Simpson family about his
three new friends.

Homer: We played Dungeons &amp; Dragons for three hours!  Then I was slain
       by an elf.
 Bart: Listen to yourself, man: you're hangin' with nerds.
Homer: You take that back!
Marge: Homer, please!  These boys sound very nice, but they're clearly
       nerds.
Homer: Really?  But nerds are my mortal enemy!
 Lisa: Dad, nerds are nothing to fear.  In fact, they've done some
       pretty memorable things.  Some nerds of note include...popcorn
       magnate Orville Redenbacher, rock star David Byrne, and supreme
       court justice David Souter.
Homer: [gasp] Oh, not Souter!  Oh, no!
-- Mmm, Burgher, 

The three nerds try to help Homer study, but he won't put any effort
into it.

Nerd 1: Come on, Mr. Simpson, you'll never pass this course if you don't
        know the periodic table.
 Homer: Ehh, I'll write it on my hand.
Nerd 1: Ho!  Including all known lanthanides and actinides?  Ha, ha!
        Good luck.
-- Cerium, praseodymium, neodymium..., 

 Homer: Come on, guys.  Look at yourselves!  All you do is study.  I'm
        going to show you the true meaning of college: we're gonna go
        out and par-ty!
Nerd 2: Wait a minute, I'll put on my snow pants.
Nerd 1: Me too.
Nerd 3: Me too.
-- Don't forget the Cougar boots, 

Ah, the college road-trip.  What better way to spread beer-fueled
mayhem?
-- Homer, 

Marge sees Homer loading cases of beer in the car, and she goes out to
him.

 Marge: If you're going for a ride, I'd like you to take Bart and Lisa.
 Homer: [plaintively] But Marge, we're college guys and we're up to no
        good.
Nerd 1: Mr. Simpson, Gary spilled his ear medicine.
-- Does it stain naugahyde?, 

The beer-fueled mayhem turns out to be a trip to the Springfield petting
zoo.  Lisa's happy that they let them feed the baby ducks, but she seems
to be alone in her happiness.

Nerd 2: I need to go to the bathroom!
  Lisa: We stopped five minutes ago!
Nerd 2: Yeah, but someone knocked on the door and I couldn't go.
-- Tension and urination just don't mix, 

Homer still tries to figure out a way to kick-start the nerds' social
lives.  He decides a big crazy prank might do the trick: maybe rolling
the Dean up in a carpet and throwing him off a bridge?  Bart has a
better idea: pignapping the Springfield A&amp;M mascot, Sir Oinkcelot.
Homer combines the plans, suggesting they roll the pig up in a carpet
and throw him off a bridge, but there are no takers.

Under cover of darkness, the five accomplices set out to steal Sir
Oinkcelot.  When they lug the pig back to Homer's car, Homer starts
playing with its tail, noticing that even if you pull it straight, it
curls right back up again.  He does it repeatedly until the pig chomps
on his hand in annoyance.  Homer has to be restrained from harming the
poor innocent pig.

Shortly thereafter, back at the dorm...

Nerd 1: Hey, the pig's acting kind of funny.
Nerd 2: He and Mr. Simpson split a case of malt liquor.
Nerd 3: Guys, he's really sick.
         [The pig collapses]
  Dean: [outside] Hell-oo...that sounds like a pig fainting!
-- Good ear on you, 

Fortunately, the pig's OK.  Homer, the Dean, and the nerds watch as the
pig is airlifted to safety, tied into a harness under a helicopter.

 Dean: I'm sorry, boys, I've -- I've never expelled anyone before,
       but...that pig had some powerful friends.
Nixon: [bitterly] Oh, you'll pay.  Don't think you won't pay!
-- They are not a crook, 

Homer is apologetic as the gates of Sprigfield College slam closed,
leaving the nerds out on the street with their suitcases.

 Homer: Guys, believe me, I didn't mean to get you expelled.
Nerd 3: Oh, don't worry, Mr. Simpson, we can take care of ourselves.
         [Snake appears, holding out his hand]
 Snake: Uh, wallet inspector.
Nerd 1: Oh, here ya go.  [All three give him their wallets] I believe
        that's all in order.
 Snake: Huh ho!  I can't _believe_ that worked.
 Homer: [realization dawning] Heyy...that's not the wallet inspector!
-- Coulda been, though, 

Homer places a worried hand to his lips, wondering what he's done.

[End of Act Two.  Time: 15:59]

Homer decides the only recourse is to let them stay at the Simpson
house.  Marge doesn't look too happy about it, but Homer pleads their
case.

 Homer: Marge!  They don't have anywhere to stay.  And they're geniuses.
        they'll solve all our problems.  They'll elevate us to the
        status of kings on earth!
Nerd 3: Mr. Simpson?  We all have nosebleeds.
-- Genii non-savants, 

The nerds sit at their computer terminals once again, only this time,
they've set them up in the Simpson's living room.  Marge idly watches
them, then remembers a phone call she has to make.  She lifts the
handset.

 Marge: [hearing modem noises] Ooh, what's wrong with this phone? it's
        making crazy noises.
Nerd 2: [contemptuously] Those "crazy noises" are computer signals.
Nerd 3: Yeah.  Some guys at MIT are sending us reasons why Captain
        Picard is better than Captain Kirk.
Nerd 1: Hah!  They're outta their minds.
-- The Great Debate continues, 

Bart and Lisa, meanwhile, are watching the Krusty the Klown Show. it's
time for an Itchy and Scratchy cartoon: "Burning Down the Mouse".  Lisa
says she's heard about it already: "This is the one where Scratchy
finally gets Itchy!"  Bart is suitably impressed.

Itchy is tied to a stake, and he looks glum.  Scratchy rubs his hands in
delight, then reaches for a crate next to him.  He puts sticks of
dynamite under the mouse's eyelids and in his ears.  He fashions a
Lincolnian hat and beard out of plastic explosive and slaps them rudely
on Itchy, attaching grenades to his ears as crude parodies of earrings.
Itchy stares up in horror as a shadow looms over his face: Scratchy is
turning a wheel, adjusting the angle of two atomic bombs so that their
sharpened tips point directly at Itchy's eyes.  Crates of TNT are
stacked around the atomic bombs.  Lighting the fuses on all the
dynamite, he hails a taxi, and leaves.

Slowly, the fuse burns down.  Itchy tries in vain to escape, his legs
struggling.  Bart and Lisa watch, transfixed.  "My purpose in life is to
witness this moment," says Bart, grasping Lisa's hand.  We see a close-
up of Itchy's sweaty face as the inevitable draws inexorably closer.
The fuse burns all the way down, and --

Suddenly the TV screen goes blank.  Bart and Lisa scream, horrified.
One of the nerds rises from behind the TV, holding a plug in each hand.
"We need the outlet for our rock tumbler," he explains.  "Plug it in,
Plug it in!" the two cry frantically.  "What, the rock tumbler or the
TV?"  "The TV, the TV!"  The nerd makes it so.

But it is too late.  A mushroom cloud is all that's left on the TV, with
"THE END" written in red superimposed on it.  The children in Krusty's
audience cheer wildly.  "Wow!" exclaims Krusty, "They'll never let us
show that again, not in a million years!"  Bart and Lisa are aghast.

 Bart: [sharpening knives] Dad, start diggin' some nerd holes!
 Lisa: [plaintively] It's bad enough that they put their retainers in
       the dishwasher; can't we do something?
Homer: Look, I'm sure we can work something out where we can all live in
       harmony, right, Marge?
Marge: No, I want those geeks outta my house!
-- Who can argue with that?, 

The only recourse is to get the nerds back into college, thinks Homer,
with a zany scheme of some sort.  The nerds aren't sure about the "zany"
idea, but Homer ignores them: "I got it!  We're gonna fix it so you guys
save the Dean's life!"

In the next scene, Homer is behind the wheel, driving with a determined
look on his face.  He checks his watch, seeing "4:59", and says,
"Perfect."  He fishtails around the corner.

The Dean is just leaving, closing the door on his way out.  He whistles
as he strolls down the path to the parking lot.  The nerds are hiding
behind a nearby bush.

Nerd 2: OK, guys: push him out of the way in exactly three seconds.
Nerd 1: Should we correct for wind resistance?
Nerd 3: Hmm, possibly.  What do _you_ think?
         [Homer hits the Dean with his car, and the Dean goes flying]
Nerd 1: Oh, my.
-- I hope he's insured, 

In the Springfield General Hospital, Homer and the nerds stand beside
the Dean's bed.  Homer apologizes for the "running-you-over prank", and
he admits that all the other pranks were his idea too.  "I'm the one who
should be expelled."  The Dean is touched by Homer's honesty, and he
wonders if perhaps he's been a bit of an ogre himself.  "Yes you have,"
Homer confirms quietly.

The Dean magnanimously offers to readmit the nerds and to forget that
the whole silly incident ever happened.  Just then, Dr. Hibbert walks in
with the Dean's prosthetic replacement hip.  It breaks in his hands, so
the Doctor jovially informs him he'll have to go easy on it.

The nerds move back into room 222, and check their answering machine.
"Number of messages received: zero," it says, and the three sigh with
relief.  They thank Homer for getting them back into college, and he
says, "The important thing is that we wrapped up all the loose ends."

But Homer has forgotten why he was at college in the first place: "So,
in conclusion, good luck on tomorrow's big final exam," says the Nuclear
Physics 101 lecturer.  "Exam?!  This is just like one of those bad
dreams," Homer says from his seat in the back row; he then glances down,
noticing he's wearing only his underwear.

Nerd 2: What are you going to do, Mr. Simpson?
 Homer: Actually, I've been working on a plan.  During the exam, I'll
        hide under some coats, and hope that somehow everything will
        work out.
Nerd 2: [determined] Or, with our help, you can cram like you've never
        crammed before!
 Homer: Whatever.  Either way is good.
-- I'm not picky, 

Homer goes to the library and takes out a wheelbarrow full of books.
The nerds tie his eyes open and hold a book in front of him.  He falls
asleep while reading another book, and one of the nerds slaps him
lightly on the cheek to wake him.  Reflexively, Homer drives his fist
into the nerd's unfortunate face, and falls back asleep.

In the exam, Homer is one of the last to leave, but he hands in his
paper with a smile, clicking his heels joyously.  The instructor glances
at his answers, and stamps a circled red "F" on his paper.

The nerds are discontented with Homer's performance.

Nerd 2: Oh, man, I can't believe you failed.
 Homer: [whining] Oh, I'm going to lose my job just 'cause I'm
        dangerously unqualified!
Nerd 2: Mr. Simpson, there is a way.  We could -- well, use a computer
        to change your grade.
 Homer: [surprised] Computers can do that?
Nerd 2: Well, yes...the only problem is the moral dilemma it raises,
        which requires --
         [Homer kisses one of the computers]
 Homer: Oh, I love -- moral whuzzah?
-- You know, ethical crisis, 

Marge: An A+!  How did you do it?
Homer: Oh, let's just say I had help from a little magic box.
Marge: You changed your grade with a computer?
Homer: D'oh!
-- How'd she figure that out?, 

Bart is impressed at Homer's ability, and Homer is quick to redirect
attention elsewhere.

 Homer: Look, the important thing is that we all learned a lesson.
        These guys learned the richness and variety of the world outside
        college.
Nerd 2: No we didn't.
 Homer: Oh.  Then I learned the real value of college is to study, and
        work hard.
  Lisa: No you didn't.  You only passed your course by cheating, which
        you always taught us was wrong.
 Homer: Hmm...true.
-- The need for Debating 101, 

Marge wants Homer to take the course over again so he can pass it
without cheating.  Homer accuses her of being worse than the crusty old
Dean.  But he sighs, accepting Marge's resolution.

Homer: Well, I guess it's back to college for me.  And that means it's
       time to -- what did I teach you guys?
Nerds: [timidly] Par - ty - down?
Homer: Yess!
-- Woo hoo!, 

[End of Act Three.  Time: 21:23]

"Louie, Louie" plays over the closing credits, as many scenes of Homer's
return to college flash by.
 EPISODE TITLE: Rosebud


EPISODE SUMMARY: 
[Syndication cuts are marked in curly braces "{}" and are courtesy of
Ricardo Lafaurie.]

It is a dark night outside the Burns Mansion.

An armed guard keeps watch outside Mr. Burns' window, chanting as they
march.  Smithers appears at a window and hushes them, and they resume
their chant more quietly.

Mr. Burns is in bed, but he is restless and fitful.  He thinks back to a
winter in his childhood...he remembers playing with a stuffed bear and
singing.  "I'm the happiest boy there is, aren't I, Bobo?" he asks it,
kissing it.  His parents watch him as he plays.

A limousine pulls up, and a figure in the shadow converses with the
parents.  "Happy!  Come here, Happy!" beckons his Mother.  "Yes, Mumsy?"

"Happy, would you like to continue living with us, your loving natural
parents," his father queries, "or would you rather live with this
twisted, loveless billionaire?"  Happy drops his bear and runs into the
limousine, donning sunglasses and proclaiming, "Let's roll!"  But his
father calls out to the speeding limo, "Wait!  You forgot your bear, a
symbol of your lost youth and innocence!"

Father: [sigh] Oh well.  At least we still have his little brother
        George.
George: [singing]
        Bwa bwa bwa bwa,
        Oh the sun shines bright on my old Kentucky Home,
        Bwa bwa bwa bwa...
         [spoken] Trust me, it'll be funny when I'm an old man.
-- Timeless classics, 

Back in the present, Burns holds a glass ball with a snowstorm scene in
his hand.  "I want my teddy," he groans, and drops the ball.  It
shatters, although the balls are NEV-R-BREAK brand Snow Globes.  "Bobo,"
Mr. Burns calls out weakly.  Smithers walks in.

   Burns: Oh, it's you.  The bedpan's under my pillow.
Smithers: [hesitantly] Who's Bobo, sir?
   Burns: Bobo?  Er, um, I meant...Lobo!  Er, Sheriff Lobo, they never
          should have cancelled that show.
-- What were they thinking?, 

Smithers mentions that the preparation for Burns' birthday have begun.
Burns laments that he won't get what he wants, and Smithers sympathizes,
imagining a naked Mr. Burns breaking out of a birthday cake and singing
"Happy Birthday, Mr. Smithers..." Smithers groans in pleasure at the
thought.

In the Simpsons' bed, it seems that Homer, too, is calling out for
"Sheriff Lobo" to be brought back.  He wakes up and screams.  Marge asks
what's wrong, and Homer points at the calendar.  It's Mr. Burns'
birthday today!  Marge doesn't see what's wrong with that, and Homer
explains that every time Mr. Burns has a birthday, all his employees
have to help out at the party.  "And I always get some terrible job,"
Homer whines, recalling his turn at holding the pinata while Mr. Burns
swings at it, blindfolded.

That day at work, Homer is surrounded by howls of derisive laughter as
he tries to remove the coat hanger that's stuck in his shirt.  "It's not
funny," says Homer petulantly, "and the one in my pants really hurts."

Mr. Burns watches the spectacle on his monitors.

   Burns: That man who's getting all those laughs, Smithers...who is he?
Smithers: Homer Simpson, sir, one of the carbon blobs from sector 7-G,
          but I don't think --
   Burns: I want this Simpson fellow to perform comedy at my party.  I
          must harness his fractured take on modern life.
Smithers: Fine, sir.  I'll get him started on some snappy Sinbad-esque
          material.
-- Better than Diceman, anyway, 

At the kitchen table, Homer snickers to himself as he writes out some
material.

Marge: What are you doing?
Homer: I'm writing a delicious send-up of Mr. Burns for his birthday
       party.  Is "poopoo" one word or two?
-- Better grab a dictionary, 

Marge: I don't think it's a good idea to humiliate your boss on his
       birthday.
 Lisa: Actually, Mom, a tweaking of Mr. Burns' foibles if done with the
       greatest of care could earn Dad a special place in the old man's
       heart.
Homer: Well, I also do a delightful impression of him.  [laughs] I paint
       a frowny face on my butt and pull down my pants!
-- Going for the subtle approach, 

Marge and Lisa groan.

Homer practises his speech before a mirror that night.

Homer: "Now I'm not saying Mr. Burns is incontinent" --
 Bart: Incontinent.  [laughs] Too rich!
 Lisa: Does either of you know what "incontinent" means?
Homer: Lisa, don't spoil our fun.
-- 

   Marge: Come on, everybody, it's time to go.
   Homer: OK, stupid.
   Marge: Homer, you've got to stop insulting everyone, especially your
          boss!
   Homer: Marge, the comedy roast is an American tradition.  It's what
          gives us the freedom to criticize our social betters.
           [Outside, Flanders clips the hedge] Hey Flanders!  You smell
          like manure.
Flanders: Uh oh.  Better cancel that dinner party tonight.  Thanks for
          the nose-news, neighbor!
-- Just practising my invective, 

At the party, the guests file into the hall in a grotesque death-march
bearing their gifts.  {Reagan and Nixon march in past the guards, but
Bush is pulled aside.}

 Guard: {Hey!}
        {[President Bush grunts]}
        {No one-termers.  [tosses him out]}
Carter: {You too, huh?  Hey, I know a good yogurt place.}
  Bush: {Get away from me, loser.}
-- One-term Republicans are bigger losers, 

The party has begun.  Smithers introduces a slideshow, "Montgomery
Burns: A Life."  There is a smattering of applause as images of Mr.
Burns' life flash by.  The last slide contains Bobo the bear, and Mr.
Burns sighs wistfully.  Smithers introduces the next act.

Smithers: Here are several fine young men who I'm sure are gonna go far.
          Ladies and gentlemen, the Ramones!
   Burns: Ah, these minstrels will soothe my jangled nerves.
Ramone 1: I'd just like to say this gig sucks!
Ramone 2: Hey, up yours, Springfield.
Ramone 1: One, two, three, four!
           [Abrasive guitar music begins]
          Happy Birthday to you!  (Happy Birthday!)
          Happy Birthday to you!  (Happy Birthday!)
          Happy Birthday, Burnsey,
          Happy Birthday to you!
Ramone 3: Go to hell, you old bastard.
           [The curtain falls]
Ramone 4: Hey, I think they liked us!
-- Silence gives consent, 

   Burns: [toward the Ramones] Have the Rolling Stones killed.
Smithers: Sir, those aren't --
   Burns: Do as I say!
-- The perils of being Smithers, 

Next, Mr. Burns opens his presents.  He's not impressed with any of
them, saying they stink, calling them piffle, and tossing Marge's
present (a Dust Buster [tm]) contemptuously aside.

Smithers: Sir, I've arranged for the people of Australia to join hands
          tonight and spell out your name with candles.  There's a
          satellite hookup on that monitor if you'll just turn your head
          slightly.
   Burns: Bah, no time.  Next!
-- O hallowed gratitude, 

I have some sad news to report: a small puppy, not unlike Lassie, was
just run over in the parking lot.
 [Audience gasps]
And now it's time for the comedy stylings of Homer Simpson!
-- Smithers warms up the audience, 

Homer makes a triumphant entrance, but he is greeted with silence.

Homer: [exaggeratedly loud] Are you ready to laugh?
  Man: Poor dog.
Homer: I said, are you ready to laugh?
Woman: Quiet, you awful man.
-- Homer starts his comedy routine, 

Homer: You know, Mr. Burns is so cheap --
Burns: What?
Homer: I mean, you know, Mr. Burns is so old --
Burns: How dare you!
Homer: Woo hoo, tough crowd.
-- The comedy routine, 

Homer decides to bring out the big guns: a cheeky impression of Mr.
Burns.  He drops his pants, revealing a charicature of Monty's face that
has been painted on his behind.  The audience is aghast.  Before Homer
can get far with his act, Mr. Burns orders for him to be destroyed.  Two
guards approach him menacingly.  A riot squad surrounds the party after
Mr. Burns announces, "This party is over."  Pandemonium breaks loose as
the uniformed men try to subdue the already quiet audience.

Homer laments his failure at home afterwards, feeling the bump on his
bald head.

Homer: Oh, where did I lose 'em?  I'll never wiggle my bare butt in
       public again.
 Lisa: I'd like to believe that this time.  I really would.
-- Hope springs eternal, 

Marge asks Bart to go down to the store to buy some ice for Homer's
cracked skull, and Bart responds, "Yes'm."

 Bart: Dad, I know you're discouraged, but please don't deny the world
       your fat can.
Homer: Don't worry, boy, he'll be ready for your Aunt Selma's birthday.
 Lisa: I knew it.
-- So much for _that_ promise, 

Smithers tries to console his master.

Look at all the wonderful things you have, sir: King Arthur's
"Excalibur".  The only existing nude photo of Mark Twain.  And that rare
first draft of the constitution with the word "suckers" in it.
-- Smithers, 

Burns is unimpressed, however.  Smithers realizes that Burns wants his
bear Bobo back.  Burns calls him a liar, and tries to thrash him, but
he's too feeble.  "Oh God, how I want my bear," he confesses, "but he's
gone, gone forever.  I'd give anything to know what happened to him."

Bobo was covered in snow that first winter when he was dropped by his
first owner, Happy.  During a thaw, he was carried into a river, to be
picked up in 1927 and given to Lindy as he makes a triumphant entrance
to Paris on the "Spirit of St. Louis".  Next, Bobo was with Hitler in
Berlin during the last days of the war in 1945.  Finally, Bobo gets dug
out of the ice in the Arctic and packed in a bag full of ice cubes.

At the Kwik-E-Mart, one of the ice diggers brings the bags to Apu.
"You've gotta start selling this for more than a dollar a bag," he tells
him, "We lost four men on this expedition!"  Apu challenges him to think
of a better way to get ice, and the man can't come up with one.  So he
and his comrades return to the frozen North.

Bart buys a bag of ice from the Hindu sales clerk.  He notices a head in
the bag, and Apu quickly thinks up an excuse about the bags with heads
being chock-full of heady goodness.  Bart slaps it down on the counter,
and realizes it's a teddy bear.  "It's probably diseased or something,"
he says, giving it to Maggie.  A close-up of the tags on the bear show
that it is "100% COTTON" and "Bobo".

[End of Act One.  Time: 9:23]

Burns is morose, pining for his Bear.  Smithers tries another plan to
cheer him up.

Smithers: [dressed in a bear suit] Here's something that should cheer
          you up, sir.  It's me, sir: Bobo!  Hug me!  Squeeze me!
          [suggestively] Tug at my fur...
   Burns: [pushing him aside] Enough!  Stop this grotesque charade.  Now
          find my teddy!  And oh, er, leave the costume.
-- Uh, Hallowe'en is next week, 

Homer watches Kent Brockman on TV.

 Kent: The Burns bear, perhaps the most valuable widdle bear in the
       world, could be anywhere.  It could be in your house...
       You could be looking at it right now.  It could be right in front
       of your face as I'm saying this, waggling back and forth, perhaps
       being held up by a loved one.
Homer: Maggie, I'm trying to watch TV.  Put that moldy old bear down!
       [realizing] Moldy?  Old?
       I'm gonna get something to eat!
-- Right on the tip of his tongue, 

{Professor John Frink has invented a robot bear for Mr. Burns.  "It's
not your original bear, of course," he concedes, "but it is programmed
to be just as cuddly."  He presses a button on the remote control, and
spiked claws pop out of the oversized bear's paws.  Frink is confused,
thinking he requested the bear to do a little dance.  It grabs Burns,
and Smithers runs up to it, "I got it," and smashes a chair over its
head, to no avail.  Frink tries to shut it off, but it intones in a
robotic monotone, "No, bear want to live," crashing through a wall to
escape.}

Maggie puts the bear behind a fishtank, its head appearing ghostly blue
through the ripples in the water.  Homer trips on Bart's skateboard and
falls down the stairs.  When he lands at the bottom, he glances at the
fishtank: "How long have we had these fish?" he gasps in amazement.  But
then he notices the bear: "Burns' bear!"

 Lisa: Bobo: it's Mr. Burns' bear all right.
Homer: Well, Burns isn't getting _this_ back cheap, I can tell you that.
       {He's gonna have to give me...my own recording studio!}
       {[In a studio, Homer sings]} {Two all-beef patties special sauce,
       lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions on a sesame-seed bun.  [drools]}
  Man: {Homer, you're drooling on the mike again.}
-- Fifth one today, 

Lisa thinks they should just give the bear back, but Homer and Bart
laugh uproariously at that idea.

Marge: Mmm...I'll sew that eye back on.
 Bart: No!  Let's send Burns the eye in the mail; he'll pay more money
       if he thinks the bear's in danger.
Homer: [in a trance] Yes, we'll send the eye.
-- 

Marge has another suggestion.

 Marge: I'm sure he'll offer a fair reward.  [as an afterthought] And
        then we'll make him double it.
Family: Huh?
 Marge: [defensive] Well why can't I be greedy once in a while?
-- Because you're the nicest?, 

Homer eventually goes with Lisa's idea.  Mr. Burns receives him in his
study.

[tenderly] Bobo, my beautiful Bobo.  I promise I'll never leave you
behind again.
 [to Homer] Ahem.  Ah, yes.  Er, naturally I can't pay you much of a
reward because I'm strapped for cash.
 [The ceiling caves in, spilling gold and jewels on him] As you can see,
this old place is falling apart...
-- It's all cubic zirconium anyway, 

Burns: I'm sure we can come to an understanding.
Homer: Yes, sir.
        [thinking] Reject the first offer.  Reject the first offer.
Burns: May I offer you a drink?
Homer: Sorry, Burns, no deal.
-- A tough bargainer, 

Homer swipes the bear on his way out.  Burns is disheartened, but feels
that Homer won't take long to crack.  At home, Homer sits on the couch
with his family, and Burns is right: Homer cracks, audibly even.  He
grabs the phone frantically: "I gotta call Burns!  I gotta call Burns!
Maybe I can still get that drink."  Bart hangs up the phone for Homer,
trying to get Homer to wait and jack up the reward.  Homer sees the
logic in Bart's proposition -- for a second, anyway.  Then he grabs for
the phone anyway, and the whole family jumps him, trying to restrain
him.

Good thing they succeeded: Burns knocks on Homer's door.

Homer: I knew you'd come crawling back.
Burns: How much do you want?
Homer: A million dollars and three Hawaiian islands.  Good ones, not the
       leper one!
Burns: Done!
-- Plus an option to pick up the leper one later, 

Monty demands the bear.  "Woo hoo, I'm rich!  Rich, I tells ya," Homer
cries, offering Burns the bear.  But Maggie still holds it tight.  "Bad
baby, bad Maggie!"  Homer admonishes her, and yanks it from her clutch.
Maggie whimpers as he does so, and Homer pauses.  "Give me the bear,"
Burns demands, "The bear, the bear!" adds Smithers.  But Maggie looks so
sad, and Homer gives in.  "The deal's off, Mr. Burns: the bear stays
here."  Monty tells Homer he's made a mistake and Smithers only growls
as the two leave.

Homer: Aw, big deal.  Who needs his money?  We're gettin' by OK.
        [Abe drives through the wall into the living room]
  Abe: Son!  You gotta help me.  I hit three people on the way over here
       and I don't have any insurance!
        [congenially] So how's by you?
-- You should have asked ten seconds ago, 

[End of Act Two.  Time: 13:57]

Burns and Smithers decide to abduct the bear.  Under cover of darkness,
they stand atop Flanders' roof, dressed in black.  Smithers shoots an
arrow into the Simpsons' roof, a wire attached to the arrow.  "Excellent
shot, Smithers, I'll be squeezing my Bobo in no time."  Just then,
Flanders' head pops out the attic: "Howdy, gents, what can I diddily-do
ya for?" he asks jovially.  But Monty sprays something in his face, and
he collapses down to the floor.

"Remember, Smithers, in and out in eighteen seconds!"  Smithers puts a
hook on pulleys on the wire, and starts across to the house, but he gets
stuck half way across.  Burns has already started his crossing, and he
slams into Smithers.  The two stay lodged there until the morning when
they are rescued by firemen.  "More cocoa, Mr. Burns?" asks Marge,
offering him some cocoa as he sits wrapped in a blanket on the back of
an ambulance.

Plan two involves using suction cups to traverse the Simpsons' kitchen
ceiling.  But as Burns and Smithers get half way across, Homer snaps on
the light and wanders over to the fridge in his underwear.

Homer: Mmm...sixty four slices of American cheese.
        [Takes the stack to the table and sits down]
       Sixty four...[eats it]
       Sixty three...[eats it]
        [Next morning]
       Two...[eats it really slowly]
       One...[eats it]
        [Marge walks in]
Marge: [incredulous] Have you been up all night eating cheese?
Homer: [slurred] I think I'm blind...
-- All that lactose, 

Burns and Smithers were waiting patiently all night on the ceiling, but
their suction cups finally give out and they fall unceremoniously to the
floor.  "Good day to you," says Burns, as the two of them brush
themselves off and leave.

   Man 1: Excuse me, we wanted to see the geek who valued the happiness
          of his children more than money.
   Homer: [unenthused] Right here.
   Man 2: Aw, you said his head was the size of a baseball.
   Homer: Oh, my life can't get any worse.
Smithers: [over the intercom] Homer Simpson, report for much worse duty.
   Homer: D'oh!
-- Homer, meet Mr. Murphy, 

Homer's much worse duty consists of holding the handle of a large grist
and turning it by running around a track -- while being whipped by a
large man in an executioner's costume.  Homer asks the man if Homer can
whip _him_ after lunch, but his request is flatly denied.  Rather than
grinding wheat, though, the grist is simply attached to the cupcake
display in the cafeteria.  "I wonder what makes it turn?" asks Lenny
pensively, but Carl dismisses it: "Who cares?"

{Homer tries to convince his youngest offspring to relinquish the bear.
"Maggie, I know you like the bear, but wouldn't you be just as happy
playing with...this box?" he says, putting it on his head and singing a
playful tune.  Maggie reaches for it, but Homer has discovered the fun
of the box for himself, and doesn't want to give it up.}

Marge: Mmm, I think we need a new hair dryer.
Homer: Marge, you must hate me for not taking Mr. Burns' money.
Marge: I don't hate you, I'm proud of you!  You came through for your
       daughter when she needed you the most.
Homer: Aw, thanks, Marge.  But it'll take a lot more than that to
       comfort _this_ tortured soul.
        [He reaches for the box and puts it on his head] Hee hee hee,
       boxey!
Marge: [indignant] Gimme that!
-- Simple pleasures, 

Homer watches Barney, that wuvable purple dinosaur, on TV.

Barney: [the dinosaur, that is]
         [singing] Two plus two is four.  Two plus two is four.  Two
        plus two is four...
 Homer: Heh heh heh, I can see why _this_ is so popular!
-- Homer learns addition, 

But Burns' image appears in place of Barney on the screen, demanding the
return of his bear.  Homer switches channels, finding "The Soul Mass
Transit System", but again Burns appears, asking for the bear.  Homer
changes to the Spanish Bee (who happens to be playing with a large
yoyo), but he's pushed out of the way by Mr. Burns.

Burns: As you can see, Simpson, I've taken over all 78 channels.  And
       you won't see any of your favorite shows again until you give in.
 Otto: Woo, that bites.
Patty: Holy crap!
-- Taking over MacGyver is a fate worse than death, 

 Burns: What's that you say?  You can live without television so long as
        you have _beer_?
 Homer: [defiantly] That's right.
 Burns: [ominously] Wrong.  All beer trucks heading towards Springfield
        have been diverted...this town will be as dry as a bone.  And if
        the rest of you beer-swilling tube-jockeys out there have a
        problem with this, talk to Homer Simpson.
         [The doorbell rings, and Homer answers it]
Barney: [brandishing a gun] Homer, give him what he wants!
-- You don't know how far he'll go, 

Homer slams the door absently in Barney's face, discharging the gun by
accident.

Bart is getting grief from the schoolyard bullies from Homer's tough
stance.  He is surrounded by Nelson, Dolph, Jimbo, and Kearney.

Nelson: My old man can't get a beer because his old man [points at
        Jimbo] won't give a beer to another old man.  Let's get him!
 Jimbo: Wait!  Why are we gettin' him?
         [Martin walks by]
Martin: Look, gentlemen.  The first snapdragon of the season!
Nelson: Never mind.  Let's just get _him_!  [points at Martin]
-- Bad timing, 

{True to his word, Monty has taken over all the channels.}

          {[A dumb sitcom is shown on TV]}
   Burns: {Smithers, I'm home!  [canned laughter]}
Smithers: {What, already?  [canned chuckle]}
   Burns: {Yes.  [loud canned laughter]}
    Lisa: {[watching] Is it my imagination or is TV getting worse?}
   Homer: {Ehh, it's about the same.  Uh oh!  Look out, Smithers!}
          {[sound of breaking glass]}
          {Heh heh, I love this show.}
-- Homer, discerning TV viewer, 

A angry crowd has formed outside the Simpson home.  Homer thinks they've
come to apologize, but Moe riles the crowd up: "Come on, let's go in
there and get the bear!"  The crowd cheers and everyone storms the
house.  Moe grabs the bear from Maggie, amid cheering, and the bear is
passed out of the house to safety.  But Maggie looks sad again.  "Aw,
geez, will you look at that," says Moe, and everyone feels bad.  "What
have we become?" asks Jasper rhetorically, and Dr. Hibbert notes, "We've
given the word 'mob' a bad name."  So they give the bear back the bear.
"What should we do now?" wonders Moe out loud, and Skinner suggests they
go and sing at the hospital.

The doorbell rings, and Homer answers it.  It's Mr. Burns.  "Look what
you've reduced me to," he implores, and snaps his fingers.  Smithers
appears and begs, "Please, please!"  Homer tries to explain that it's
not his bear: it now belongs to Maggie.  Burns goes out to the sandbox
to talk to her.

To break the ice, he observes, "So, good sand today, hmm?"  Maggie
offers him her pacifier, and Burns sees no way to refuse it graciously.
But when he tastes it, he grimaces, and at that exact moment, a
photographer pops up from behind the fence and snaps his picture.

   Burns: Well, Maggie, I've given this a lot of though.  I'm sure we
          can come to some sort of agreement --
           [Starts trying to pull the bear away, but he's too weak]
          Beaten by an infant...what could be more humiliating?
Reporter: [taking a photo] What a scoop!
-- You had to ask, 

Burns concedes defeat.  "But I want you to do something for me," he
says: "Hang on to that bear.  Don't make the same mistake I made."  He
sighs and starts to walk away.  But Maggie follows him and offers him
the bear.

          [Maggie offers him the bear]
   Burns: For me?  Bobo?
          Smithers, I'm so happy.  Something amazing has happened, I'm
          actually happy.  Take a note!  [resolute] From now on, I'm
          only going to be good and kind to everyone.
Smithers: I'm sorry sir, I don't have a pencil.
   Burns: Ehh, don't worry, I'm sure I'll remember it.
-- 

The family has been watching the events.

Well...we didn't get any money, but Mr. Burns got what he wanted.
Marge, I'm confused!  Is this a happy ending or a sad ending?
-- Homer the prescriptivist, 

Smithers tucks Burns in at home, and Burns seems content.  "Ah, Bobo,
reunited at last.  But I can't help but wonder what the future holds for
you."  Wondering, he drifts off to sleep.

In 1,000,000 A.D., the world looks rather like it might have in
1,000,000 B.C., with apes using men as slaves to pull their carts under
pain of whipping.  The only thing that gives it away is Mr. Burns: his
head has been preserved in a glass ball containing some fluid, but his
body is that of a robot.  "Bobo, I know I say this every century," he
sighs, coming across Bobo's chewed-up form, "but I'll never leave you
behind again."  He bounds off into the distance.  "Wait for me, sir!
Woof!" calls Smithers, his body that of a robotic dog.

 EPISODE TITLE: Treehouse of Horror IV


EPISODE SUMMARY: 
[Syndication cuts are marked in curly braces "{}" and are courtesy of
Ricardo Lafaurie and Frederic Briere.]

Bart strolls through a gallery of paintings.

 Bart: Paintings: lifeless images rendered in colorful goop.  But at
       night, they take on a life of their own.  They become portals to
       hell, so scary and horrible and gruesome that --
Marge: Bart!  You should warn people this episode is very frightening.
       And maybe they'd rather listen to that old "War of the Worlds"
       broadcast on NPR, hmm?
 Bart: Yes, mother.
-- There's a good boy, 

Marge gives Maggie to Bart so that she can buy some earrings at the gift
shop.

The subject of our first painting tonight is the most foul, evil,
vicious, diabolical beast to stalk the earth.  Of course I refer to...
 [Maggie stuffs her pacifier in Bart's mouth]
...mm mm-mmm!
 [Bart spits it out]
...the devil!
-- Bart, 

The title "The Devil and Homer Simpson" appears in front of the
painting, which depicts Satan's head.

The scene changes to a runway.  The announcer tells of the next item in
their fall catalogue, "A vision in raspberry cream."  A model's shapely
legs make their way down the runway.  At the end, we see Homer looking
up delightedly at the donut atop the legs: "Pure genius!"  He drools.

But alas, it was all a dream.  Homer awakes to find himself at the power
plant in front of a box of donuts.  "And now to make the leap from
dreams to reality," he says, hungrily opening the box.  But the box is
empty, devoid of donuts!

Lenny: Sorry, Homer.  While you were daydreaming we ate all the donuts.
 Carl: Well, there were a few left, but we chucked them at an old man
       for kicks.
        [Shot of Abe running with a donut stuck to his head]
  Abe: Damn buzzards!  I ain't dead yet.
-- Knockin' on heaven's door, 

Homer panics a little, running back to his work station.  "Stay calm,"
he reassures himself, "remember your training."  He reaches for the
"Emergency Procedures" manual, and opens it up.  A square has been cut
out of most of the pages -- a square big enough to hold a solitary
donut.  But Homer finds no donut; all that's left is a piece of paper.
Homer reads it.

"Dear Homer, I. O. U. one emergency donut.  Signed, Homer."
Bastard!  He's always one step ahead.
-- Homer, not realizing his own foresight, 

He contemptuously tears the note to shreds, and rues his misfortune.

   Homer: [ruefully] I'd sell my soul for a donut.
           [The devil appears, looking like Flanders]
Flanders: Heh heh, that can be arranged.
   Homer: What -- Flanders!  You're the devil?
Flanders: Ho ho, it's always the one you least suspect.
-- All those wasted years of church, 

Flanders wants to ensure Homer means what he said.

Flanders: Many people offer to sell their souls without reflecting on
          the grave ramifications --
   Homer: [impatiently] _Do_ you have a donut or not?
Flanders: Comin' up.  Just sign here.  Careful, hot pen!
-- Desperation calls for drastic measures, 

Homer signs away his soul, being careful not to burn himself on the
flaming pen.  Burns and Smithers watch the transaction.

   Burns: Hmm...who's that goat-legged fellow?  I like the cut of his
          jib.
Smithers: Er, Prince of Darkness, sir.  He's your eleven o'clock.
-- The next installment on the billion, 

The devil makes it so!  A whinnying apparition with a "Hell's Kitchen"
apron procures a single donut for Mr. Simpson.

Flanders: Now remember, the instant you finish it, I own your soul for
          --
   Homer: [through a full mouth] Hey, wait: if I don't finish this last
          bite, you don't get my soul, do you?
Flanders: Well, technically, no, but --
   Homer: [gloating] I'm smarter than the devil!
-- I know you are but what am I?, 

Flanders doesn't like Homer's gloating, and he turns into a fearsome
beast, promising to see Homer in hell yet.  He disappears back into the
ground in a ball of flame, but Homer's not worried.  "Not likely," he
giggles, putting the last little piece in his shirt pocket.

That night, Homer wanders out of bed half-asleep, looking for something
to eat.  He opens the fridge and looks at all the leftovers, but his
eyes are drawn to the little piece of donut despite all the signs
warning him he's not supposed to eat it.  He tosses it into his mouth.
"Mmm, forbidden donut."

The minute he swallows it, the devil appears.  "Well, well: finishing
something?"  A hole of fire appears in the kitchen floor, and Homer is
drawn towards it.  He grabs onto the fridge door, clinging desperately
to it as the suction becomes more powerful.  Marge comes in to see what
the commotion is about, and her hair gets sucked towards the peephole to
hell.

Homer's not strong enough, and he gets drawn in.  But he gets stuck
halfway.  "Your wide behind won't save you this time!" warns the devil.
Bart and Lisa walk in as well, and the devil says nonchalantly, "Hey
Bart."  Lisa sees what's about to happen.

    Lisa: Wait!  Doesn't my father have the right to a fair trial?
Flanders: Oh, you Americans with your due process and fair trials.  This
          is always so much easier in Mexico.
-- Only until NAFTA comes in, 

But the devil acquiesces to Lisa's wishes.  He promises that the trial
will be at the stroke of midnight, and that meanwhile Homer must spend
the day in hell.  His trident turns into a plunger and he forces Homer's
mass down through the floor.  Homer himself plunges down into the fiery
abyss.

He lands at the bottom on a conveyer belt.  "That wasn't so bad," he
sighs, but he gets chopped up into little pieces with a machette by a
demon of some sort.  His mouth, left ear, and both shoes are put in the
"Hot Dog Meat" bin.

[From 3F31, we know the following scene was cut for the original airing
of this show.  Transcription by Frederic Briere.]

A demon selects Homer's head from several and grips it.  He rolls it
down an alley as Homer's head screams, until it hits the spiked pins and
breaks open, revealing a note: "IOU one brain, signed God".

Back at home, Marge looks at the phone book.

Marge: [looking at phone book] Lawyers, lawyers, lawyers...oh!  Lionel
       Hutz.  "Cases won in 30 minutes or your pizza's free."  Hmm.
 Bart: I'd sell my soul for a formula one racing car.
        [Satan Ned appears with a race car]
  Ned: Heh heh heh, that can be arranged.
 Bart: Changed my mind.  Sorry.
        [Ned vanishes] Cool!
Marge: Bart!  Stop pestering Satan.
-- 

[End of cut scene.]

In the room with a "Hell Labs: Ironic Punishments Division" sign on the
door, Homer is strapped into a chair with mountains of donuts all
around.  "So, you like donuts, eh?" his keeper queries.  "Uh huh," Homer
answers uncertainly.  "Well, have all the donuts in the world!" his
keeper ripostes, and a metallic machine monstrosity starts cramming
donuts towards Homer's mouth by fours.  Eagerly he devours them.  {Three
seconds' worth of shots of Homer eating them are cut in syndication.}

Much later, the machine still works overtime, and Homer has become a
grotesque blob, but his relentless masticatory pace hasn't slowed.
There are almost no donuts left in the room, and Homer's keeper is
confused.  "I don't understand it.  James Coco went mad in fifteen
minutes!"

That night, in the Simpson living room, Homer appears through the floor
in a cage where the bars are made of fire.  Lionel Hutz walks in combing
his hair with a fork.

Marge: Homer!  Are you all right?
Homer: [meekly] No.
 Hutz: Mr. Simpson, don't you worry.  I watched Matlock in a bar last
       night.  The sound wasn't on, but I think I got the gist of it.
-- He learns fast, 

A fiery pentagram burns its way into the floor, and up through it the
Grim Reaper appears on the bench.  He raps his gavel.

Hear Ye, Hear Ye.  The Court of Infernal Affairs is now in session.
-- The Grim Reaper speaks, 

Lionel Hutz opens the proceedings.

    Hutz: First some ground rules.  Number one, we get bathroom breaks
          every half-hour.
Flanders: Agreed.  Number two, the jury will be chosen by me.
    Hutz: Agreed.  [realizing] No, wait --
Flanders: Silence!
-- You've been told, 

The devil introduces the members of the jury.

Flanders: I give you the Jury of the Damned!  Benedict Arnold, Lizzie
          Borden, Richard Nixon --
   Nixon: But I'm not dead yet!  In fact, I just wrote an article for
          Redbook.
Flanders: Hey, listen: I did a favor for you!
   Nixon: [humbly] Yes, master.
-- Evil Republicans!, 

The devil continues introducing the jury.

John Wilkes Booth, Blackbeard the Pirate, John Dillinger, and the
starting line of the 1976 Philadelphia Flyers!
-- Satan introduces the jury, 

Marge tries to find seats for everyone.  Lizzie Borden is forced to sit
on Lisa's ergonomic chair, but she can't quite figure it out.
Blackbeard is even less fortunate.

     Marge: [next to the high chair] I'm sorry, Mr. Blackbeard.  We're
            low on chairs, and this is the last one.
Blackbeard: Arr!  This chair be high, says I.
-- A tautology, 

The devil begins to make his case against Homer.

I hold here a contract between myself and one Homer Simpson pledging me
his soul for a donut -- which I delivered!  And it was scrump-diddley-
umptious!
-- The Satan/Flanders beast, 

Flanders: I simply ask for what is mine!
           [He sits down smugly]
    Hutz: [cocky] That was a right-pretty speech, sir.  But I ask you,
          what is a contract?  Webster's defines it as "an agreement
          under the law which is unbreakable."  [emphasizing] Which is
          unbreakable!
           [The jury look at him]
          Excuse me, I must use the restroom.
-- An expert law-talking guy, 

Hutz runs up to the bathroom and slams the door.  An hour later, he
still hasn't returned.  Marge goes up to look for him, but she's greeted
by the curtains blowing in front of the open window.

So the Reaper feels he has no choice but to sentence Homer to an
eternity.  But Marge runs in with a photo of Homer and her at her
wedding.  It's a picture of Homer choking in an emergency room, and
Marge explains that Homer ate the entire wedding cake by himself before
the wedding.  The jury find this roundly amusing.  But she hastily tells
them, "Read the back!"

Blackbeard: {[looking at the photo] Arr, 'tis some kind of treasure
            map!}
    Arnold: {You idiot!  You can't read.}
Blackbeard: {Aye, 'tis true.  My debauchery was my way of compensatin'!}
-- No brain cells left, 

Arnold reads, "Dear Marge: you have given me your hand in marriage.  All
I can give you in return is my...soul, which I pledge to you forever."
Lizzie announces, "We've heard enough.  Your Honor, we find that Homer
Simpson's soul is legally the property of Marge Simpson and not of the
devil."  The devil is despondent, but Bart and Lisa are elated.  The
judge and jury disappear in a puff.

[Another 3F31-revealed scene goes here, courtesy of Frederic Briere.]

 Hutz: [walking around a corner] Well, I didn't win.  Here's your pizza.
Marge: But we _did_ win!
 Hutz: That's OK: the box is empty.
-- His end of the deal, 

[End of cut scene.]

Flanders: All right, Simpson.  You get your soul back.  [threateningly]
          But let that ill-gotten donut be forever on your head!
           [Next day at breakfast]
   Homer: [pulling pastry from his head and eating it]
   Marge: Homer, stop picking at it!
   Homer: Oh, but I'm so sweet and tasty.
-- And covered with sprinkles, 

 Homer: Well, time to go to work.
  Lisa: Dad, I wouldn't go outside if I were you.
         [Chief Wiggum and a lot of cops stand on the street outside]
Wiggum: Don't worry, boys.  He's gotta come out of there some time.
-- Patience is a virtue, 

[End of Act One.  Time: 7:56]

Back in the gallery, Bart narrates the second spooky story.

Bart: The next exhibit in out ghoulish gallery is entitled..."The School
      Bus"?  [realizing] Oh, they must mean "The Ghoooul Bus."
Lisa: [reads the painting] Nope, says right there: "School Bus".
Bart: [with mock enthusiasm] Well, there's nothing scarier than having
      to go to school.  Ha ha!  [groans]
-- Lame introductions, 

The title, "Terror at 5 and a half feet" appears on the screen, and
behind it, the school bus.  On board, Bart sits next to Milhouse.

Milhouse: Hey Bart, look.  Krusty trading cards.  The long-awaited
          "Eight Series".
    Bart: [reading the cards] "Krusty visits relatives in Annapolis,
          Maryland.  Krusty poses for trading card photo."
Milhouse: Hmm...he seems to be running a little low on ideas.
    Bart: Well, at least you got the gum.
Milhouse: [biting it] Ow!  I cut my cheek.
-- Only $1.49 a pack, 

Suddenly, a tire falls off the bus!  Otto tries in vain to control the
swerving vehicle, but he can't help veering into the path of an oncoming
transport truck.  Just before the inevitable crash, Bart wakes up
screaming.  Feeling his damp blankets, he says, "I hope this is sweat."

He walks into the kitchen for breakfast.

Lisa: Bart, what's wrong?
Bart: [in a monotone] I just had a vision of my own horrible fiery
      death.
Lisa: [expectantly] And?
-- That's it?, 

Marge realizes that Bart has had a nightmare, and she tries to reassure
him.  But an air-horn blast sounding suspiciously like that of the
transport truck makes Bart scream.  Homer walks in, proudly displaying
his air-horn and life jackets which he picked out of some guy's boat
down at the marina.  He blows the horn one more time, and Bart's nerves
are jarred.

It's a rainy day as Bart and Lisa board the school bus.  Bart is
surprised to see Principal Skinner sitting on the bus.

Hello, Simpson.  I'm riding the bus today because Mother hid my car keys
to punish me for talking to a woman on the phone.  She was right to do
it.
-- Seymour "Norman" Skinner, 

Lisa gets the attention of everyone on the bus.

  Lisa: Excuse me.  Bart's a little upset this morning, so could
        everyone please be extra-nice to him?
         [Everyone laughs]
 Jimbo: Hey, where's your diaper, baby?  [pulls down Bart's pants]
Martin: Thank goodness he's drawn attention away from my shirt.  ["Wang
        Computers"]
-- Small mercies, 

Bart sits next to Milhouse, rubbing his throat dejectedly.  He glances
out the window and sees a gremlin clawing its way up the side of the
bus.  It sees him looking at it, and it grins, its claws digging furrows
in the side of the bus.  Bart grabs Milhouse.

    Bart: Milhouse...Milhouse, wake up, quick!  Look out the window.
Milhouse: No way, Bart.  If I lean over, I leave myself open to wedgies,
          wet willies, or even the dreaded rear-admiral!
-- Covering his ass, so to speak, 

Bart pushes Milhouse out of the way and approaches Otto.  He implores
Otto to do something about the Gremlin on the side of the bus.  Otto
glances out and sees Hans driving an AMC Gremlin.  "No problemo, Bart-
dude, I'll get rid of him," he says, ramming Hans mercilessly.  Hans
begins to skid out of control, and he whines, "Oh no, I just made my
last payment."  He drives off the road and stops the vehicle just before
it hits a tree, but it explodes nonetheless.

Bart's fears still aren't assuaged.  He looks out the window again, and
sees the gremlin on the back of the bus.  It pulls a metal cap off
something and begins removing spaghetti-strands of wire from under the
bus' side-paneling.  Bart yells, "Everybody, there's a monster on the
side of the bus!"  Everyone screams and runs over to look.

   Jimbo: Hey, there's no monster.
   Ralph: You're deceptive.
    Otto: I don't see anything.
Milhouse: Hey!  Who's driving the bus?
    Otto: Ooh, una momento, por favor.
-- Spanish 101, 

{The aliens from a previous Hallowe'en special watch from space,
scoffing at the foolish Earthlings who are frightened of a creature that
does not exist.  They laugh contemptuously, but stop when they notice a
gremlin on the side of their ship.}

Bart stares worriedly out the window.  The gremlin jumps from under the
bus, and makes the finger-across-throat gesture at Bart.

Skinner: Now I've gotten word that a child is using his imagination...
         and I've come to put a stop to it!
   Bart: [desperate] No, no, it's true, there's a monster on the bus!
Skinner: The only monster on this bus is a lack of proper respect for
         the rules.
-- Seymour's adages, 

The principal pulls the shade down over the window so Bart won't have to
worry about it any more.  Bart is still nervous, however, and he tries
to avoid peeking under the blind.  Eventually, he can resist no longer,
and he pulls it up.  He screams as Groundskeeper Willy's face appears at
the window.  It seems Willy, too, must ride the bus.

Me mule wouldn't work in the mud.  [mournfully] So I had to put
seventeen bullets in 'er!
-- Willy, problem-solver, 

Bart is becoming desperate.

    Bart: [with forced happiness] You believe me, don't you?  You're my
          friend who believes me: sweet, trustworthy Milhouse.
Milhouse: Actually, Bart, you're kinda creeping me out.  Uh, I think I'm
          gonna go sit with that foreign exchange student.
           [He does so]
    Uter: Ah, guten tag!  Would you care for a bite of my
          Vengelerstrasse bar?  I also have a bag of marzipan Joy Joys.
-- Joy Joys Mit Iodine, even, 

Bart hears a banging on the wheel hub under his feet.  He looks out the
window and the gremlin jumps out from under the bus.  It reaches towards
the lug-nuts that hold the wheel on.  Its claws make sparks against the
metal of the spinning tire, and it manages to remove one of the nuts.
After sniffing it disdainfully, it tosses it aside.

 Bart: The gremlin's taking off the wheel.  Stop the bus or we're all
       gonna die!
        [Seymour grabs him in a headlock]
Willy: Take me bridle and lash his hands to the seat.
-- A just punishment, 

Skinner has decided to seat Uter next to Bart.  Uter offers Bart another
lick of his flavor wax, and Bart accepts the offer, cringing.  Bart
suggests that Uter loosen the ropes that bind him, and he gladly
complies: "Ja, das ist gut."

Bart looks out the window again to see the gremlin continuing to remove
the nuts from the wheel.  He looks below his seat and sees a box of
flares, but the four flares have been removed.  Jimbo is the culprit
this time: he's lit them and put two of them in Martin's pants.  Bart
goes over and grabs one without Martin noticing, but he inadvertently
knocks the other one loose.  So he puts it back.

He walks over to the window and pulls the "Emergency Release" lever, but
the pressure difference between the air inside and outside the bus tries
to suck Bart and everyone else out of the bus.  He manages to keep his
grip nonetheless.  He brandishes the flare, and the gremlin notices.
Just then, Homer drives by and blares his air-horn, greeting Bart with a
cheerful "Hey, boy."

The gremlin, sensing its plans are about to be thwarted, tries to remove
the lug-nuts faster.  Skinner and Willy are trying to pull Bart's body
back inside the bus.

Skinner: Pull, Willy, pull!
  Willy: I'm doing all the pulling, you blouse-wearing poodle walker!
-- Fitting epithets, 

The grown men succeed in pulling our hero back inside the bus.  As they
do so, Bart drops the lit flare and it bounces down the side of the bus.
Fortunately, it hits the gremlin and its body catches on fire.  It gapes
and loses its grip on the bus, falling off and bouncing down the road in
a little ball of flame.  Flanders happens to be driving behind it and it
smacks into his windshield.  Aghast, he skids to a halt and runs back to
its smoking body.

"Oh dear Lord," he exclaims, looking at its inert form, "it's some sort
of hideous monster."  He wraps it up in his jacket and holds it to him.
An angry claw slashes out, and Ned smiles.  "Aw, isn't that cute.  He's
trying to claw my eyes out!"  He hugs it.

The bus arrives safely at Springfield Elementary.  Everyone stands
outside the bus, staring at the tears in the metal made by the gremlin's
claws.  Skinner taps the lug-nut remaining in the back tire, and it
falls out, taking the wheel off with it.  "Gadzooks!"  Bart is being led
away on a stretcher, wearing a straight-jacket.

   Bart: Look at the bus.  I was right, I tell you, I was right!
Skinner: [sternly] Right or wrong, your behavior was still disruptive,
         young man!  Perhaps spending the remainder of your life in a
         madhouse will teach you some manners.
 Nelson: Ha, ha!
-- No punishment is too severe, 

The orderly slams the door and heads off to the New Bedlam Mental
Hospital with the siren blaring.  Bart starts to relax: "At least now I
can get some rest."  But the gremlin appears at the back window and taps
on the glass.  It lifts Flanders' decapitated head up by the hair and
the head intones, "Heidily-ho, Bart!"  Bart screams.

[End of Act Two.  Time: 14:16]

Back in the gallery once again...

 Bart: We come now to the final and most terrifying painting of the
       evening.  To even gaze upon it is [dramatically] to go mad.
Homer: [looking at it] Aah!  They're dogs...and they're playing poker!
-- At least they're not playing pool, 

We had a story to go with this painting, but it was far too intense.  So
we just threw something together with vampires.  Enjoy!
-- Bart, 

It is "Bart Simpson's Dracula".  The family watch Kent Brockman deliver
the news on TV.

Brockman: Another local peasant has been found dead -- drained of his
          blood with two teeth marks on his throat.  This black cape was
          found on the scene.
           [Cape has "DRACULA" written on it]
          Police are baffled.
  Wiggum: We think we're dealing with a supernatural being, most likely
          a mummy.  As a precaution, I've ordered the Egyptian wing of
          the Springfield museum destroyed.
-- Taking no chances, 

A brief camera pan shows the police officers smashing mummy cases and
burning things.  But Lisa sees that they've erred.

 Lisa: No, no, they're wrong!  The creature they seek is the walking
       undead!  Nosferatu!  Das Wampyr!
        [Family looks blankly]
        [exasperated] A vampire!
Homer: Heh, heh.  Lisa, vampires are make-believe, just like elves,
       gremlins, and eskimos.
-- That's "inuit" to you, 

Brockman: In a completely unrelated story, Montgomery Burns has just
          closed a deal to buy the Springfield Blood Bank.
   Burns: [blood on his cheek] Ooh, I'm very excited about this deal.
          We --
           [notices the blood, wipes it off and eats it]
          Oh, precious blood.
   Homer: Mmm, business deal.
-- Homer the CEO, 

In the next scene, the Simpsons are driving along a dark road with dead
trees lining the sides, under a moon in a cloudy evening sky.

Homer: It sure was nice of Mr. Burns to invite us to a midnight dinner
       at his country house in...
       Pennsylvania!
 Lisa: Aw, there's something fishy about this whole setup.
Marge: Lisa, stop being so suspicious.  Did everyone wash their necks
       like Mr. Burns asked?
-- To clean off the bubonic plague, no doubt, 

As they drive along the narrow road to the castle, Mr. Burns' head
appears in the sky, a wavering ghostly image against the full moon.
When they arrive at the house, Homer rings the doorbell.

   Burns: [over the intercom] Welcome, come in.  Ah, fresh victims for
          my ever-growing army of the undead --
Smithers: Sir, you have to let go of that button.
   Burns: Well, son of a bitch --
-- Vampires and technology don't mix, 

The door creaks open, and the family walk in to the dark stone entrance
hall.  Mr. Burns appears in a puff of smoke on some nearby stairs.

   Burns: Well, if it isn't my good friends, the, er --
Smithers: Simpson family, master.
   Burns: Simpson, eh?  Excellent.
-- The running gag continueth, 

Lisa, the perceptive one, has noticed Mr. Burns' shadow seems to act
independently of his body, and she becomes suspicious.

 Lisa: [sotto voce] Dad, do you notice anything strange?
Homer: [sotto voce] Yeah, his hairdo looks so queer --
Burns: I heard that!
Homer: [defensively] It was the boy!
-- Bart the scapegoat, 

Mr. Burns seats his guests at one end of a long table while he takes the
other end.

Homer: Ooh, punch!
 Lisa: [sniffs it] Ew!  Dad, this is blood!
Homer: Correction -- _free_ blood.
-- Always lookin' for ways to save, 

Lisa is becoming more certain something's terribly wrong.  She
"accidentally" spills blood on herself, then claiming she and Bart have
to go wash up.  When Bart begins to protest, she smears blood on his
face and drags him along.

Bart is not convinced that Mr. Burns is a vampire.  "And even if he was,
we're not going to stumble on his secret hiding place."  But as he says
this, he presses down on a stone-arm torch holder.  A wall slides back,
revealing the secret location of the washer and dryer.

Lisa sees reason.  "You're probably right.  Let's just go back to...
(gasp)" In ghostly red neon lettering, she sees "TO SECRET VAMPIRE ROOM"
on the wall, and below that, in green, "NO GARLIC" flashes.

Bart and Lisa walk down the stairs into a room full of coffins.

Lisa: [motioning to the coffins] Satisfied?
Bart: Big deal.  It's no different from the basement in Grandpa's rest
      home.
-- _Those_ coffins are empty, though, 

Lisa notices a tome resting on a stand, and she runs over to read the
title: "Yes, I Am a Vampire, by Monty Burns.  Foreword by Steve Allen."
As she opens the book, the lids of the coffins begin to open.  Bart
tries to get Lisa's attention.

Bart: [strangled] Shee, ba-ba-ba-ba --
Lisa: Please, Bart, I've seen your stupid Shemp.
Bart: Gna-gna-gna-gna --
Lisa: Yeah, I've seen your Curly too!
-- Bart tries to warn Lisa of the walking undead, "Treehouse of Horror
    IV"

A greenish hand rakes its claws along the page of the book she's
reading, and she screams in fright.  The two children run frantically up
the spiral staircase.  On the way up, Bart notices a "SUPER FUN HAPPY
SLIDE" lever protruding from the wall, and he pulls it, figuring he
won't be back any time soon.  The stairs change to a slippery stone
ramp, and Bart begins his descent.  At first, he shouts "Whee!", but as
he nears the bottom, his joy turns to fear as the arms of the undead
reach for him.

He is grabbed by an undead woman in a purple dress.  Before she can do
anything, a bat flies into the room.  It turns into Mr. Burns, who grins
evilly at Bart.  "Well, if it isn't little...uh, boy!" he cackles with
glee.

Lisa runs back into the dining room.

 Lisa: [breathlessly] Mom, Dad: Mr. Burns is a vampire, and he has Bart!
Burns: Why, Bart is right here.
 Bart: [droning] Hello, Mother.  Hello, Father.  I missed you during my
       uneventful absence.
Homer: Oh, Lisa, you and your stories.
       "Bart is a vampire."
       "Beer kills brain cells."
       Now let's go back to that...building...thingy, where our beds and
       TV...is.
-- The king of eloquence, 

Back home, Lisa tosses and turns in her bed, unable to sleep.  When she
hears a scraping noise at her window, she opens the curtains to discover
that Bart is floating mysteriously outside.  She yells.

    Bart: Come join us, Lisa.  It's so cool: you get to stay up all
          night drinking blood.
Milhouse: And if you say you're a vampire, you get a free small soda at
          the movies.
-- No "cons" to vampirehood, 

Lisa refuses adamantly, but Bart informs her she has no choice,
whereupon he crashes through the window.  She screams, and Bart exposes
her neck, his fangs growing.  Fortunately, Homer rushes into the room.

Homer: Bart!  How many times have I told you not to bite your sis --
       [gasps] Wait a minute!  You _are_ a vampire!
  Abe: Quick!  We have to kill the boy!  [holds a stake and mallet]
Marge: How do you know he's a vampire?
  Abe: He's a vampire?  Aah!  [runs away]
-- A true test of mettle, 

To escape, Bart turns into a bat and flies out through the window,
laughing diabolically.

Homer, we've got to do something.  Today, he's drinking people's blood.
Tomorrow, he could be smoking!
-- Marge, concerned about Vampire Bart, 

 Lisa: The only way to get Bart back is to kill the head vampire: Mr.
       Burns!
Homer: Kill my boss?  Do I dare to live out the American dream?
-- Ethical dilemmas, 

So the family returns to Mr. Burns castle in Pennsylvania.

{This is dangerous.  I wish we could have found a sitter for Maggie...}
-- Marge, on a quest to kill Vampire Burns, 

{Homer notices the "SUPER FUN HAPPY SLIDE" lever, but Lisa warns him not
to pull it.  Homer agrees that killing will probably be fun enough.}

As they get to the bottom of the stairs, Lisa hands Homer a wooden stake
and mallet, and tells him, "You must drive this stake right through his
heart."  Homer looks over at Burns' coffin apprehensively.  He
approaches it and tears the lid off to reveal a sleeping Monty Burns.
"Take that, vile fiend!" he cries, hammering the stake into the still
body.  "Uh, Dad?  That's his crotch," observes Lisa.

Homer removes the stake sheepishly, and drives it into the old man's
heart.  Burns awakes suddenly, but it's too late: he gasps and groans as
his body melts into a puddle of flesh.  Homer sighs with relief, but
Burns has a little life left still: "You're fired!" he yells, quickly
melting again.

At the kitchen table the next day, Lisa comments, "It's so nice having
everything back to normal."  But Grandpa Simpson flies in, wearing a
black cape.

I'm a vampire, and I've come to suck your blood!
 [His false fangs fall out and he crashes into the refrigerator]
Oh!  [weakly] This cape is giving me a rash.
-- Fearsome Vampire Abe, 

Lisa can't understand what has happened.

 Lisa: Grandpa's a vampire?
 Bart: We're all vampires!
 Lisa: But, no!  We killed Mr. Burns --
Homer: You have to kill the _head_ vampire.
 Lisa: [points at Homer] _You're_ the head vampire?
Marge: No, _I'm_ the head vampire.  [laughs ghoulishly]
 Lisa: Mom?!
Marge: I _do_ have a life outside this house, you know.
-- Lucrative moonlighting, 

The family swoop towards Lisa, hissing at her.  But then everyone turns
to the camera and says, "Happy Hallowe'en, everybody!"  They begin to
sing "Hark, the Herald Angels Sing" while Milhouse plays a miniature
grand piano and Santa's Little Helper dances.

[End of Act Three.  Time: 21:07]

The theme music over the end has an "Addams Family" motif throughout,
and the "Gracie Films" music is different: instead of "Shh!", someone
screams, and an organ plays the normal music but in a minor key.
 EPISODE TITLE: Marge on the Lam


EPISODE SUMMARY: 
[Syndication cuts are marked in curly braces "{}" and are courtesy of
Ricardo Lafaurie and Frederic Briere.]

The Simpsons watch a telethon.

  Man: [quietly] Well, sir, it has been an uneventful week in Badger
       Falls...where the women are robust, the men are pink-cheeked, and
       the children are pink-cheeked and robust.
        [Audience laughs loudly]
Homer: What the hell's so funny?
  Man: At the Apple Biscuit cafe, where the smiles are free, don't you
       know, Sven Inqvist studied the menu, and finally he ordered the
       same thing he has every day.
        [Audience laughs and applauds]
 Bart: Maybe it's the TV.
Homer: Stupid TV.  [Hits it] Be more funny!
-- TV: object of aggression, 

The man reading the story passes control over to Troy McClure, reasoning
that he can't keep up his pace forever.

  Troy: Hi, I'm Troy McClure.  You might remember me from such telethons
        as "Out With Gout '88" and "Let's Save Tony Orlando's House."
        Folks, do you realize without your support, public television
        can't afford to bring you such award-winning shows as "Edward
        the Penitent"?
         [Cut to clip]
Edward: [kissing the papal ring] I'm really, really, _really_ sorry --
  Pope: I'm afraid "sorry" doesn't cut it with this pope!
-- Eleven "Tony"-winning shows, 

A phone on a table near Troy begins to ring.

 Troy: What the hell -- Oh!  We got a call.
Homer: Ha ha!  Some idiot actually called in.
 Troy: Hello?  What's your name?
Marge: Marge Simpson.
Homer: Aah!
-- My wife's an idiot!, 

Marge generously pledges thirty dollars, then thanks Troy before hanging
up.

Marge, it's public TV!  They never have anything good.  Where are the
Geraldos?  Where are the Ewbankses-es?
-- Homer objects to Marge pledging money, 

But Marge stands by her decision.

Marge: [of public TV] They need our support!  Besides, they gave me two
       tickets to the ballet.
Homer: [jubilant] Ballet?  Woo-hoo!
Marge: [incredulous] You like ballet?
Homer: Marjorie, _please_.  I enjoy _all_ the meats of our cultural
       stew.
-- Particularly the snouts and entrails, 

Homer imagines himself at the "ballet": he sits in the front row at the
circus watching a bear with a hat driving a cart around the ring while
Homer sings along with the calliope.  He continues to sing while Marge
watches him with a worried look.

Just then, the doorbell rings.  Marge opens the door to discover Ruth
Powers, the next door neighbor.  Ruth wants to borrow a power-sander,
but when Marge refers the question to Homer, he dismisses it: "Nope!"
Yet his feet are resting on one as it chews into the carpet.  When Marge
points this out, Homer acquiesces, but warns, "Remember: it's mine,"
even though it has a sign on it saying "Property of Ned Flanders."

In the kitchen, Marge shows Homer a magazine with pictures of ballet
dancers in it.

 Homer: _That's_ what ballet is?  [whining] Oh --
 Marge: You promised!  You can't back out like when you volunteered for
        that Army experiment to avoid dinner at my sisters'.
         [Flashback]
Doctor: Mr. Simpson, you _do_ realize this may result in hair loss,
        giddiness, and the loss of equilibrium?
 Homer: Yeah, yeah, just give me the serum.
         [Doctor injects him]
         [Back to the present]
 Homer: Heh heh, it was worth it.
         [Homer falls out of his chair]
         [giddily] Tee hee hee!  Hee hee hee hee --
-- A tangled web, 

At the Power Plant, Homer walks alongside Carl and Lenny.

 Carl: Hey Homer, you wanna get a beer on the way home?
Homer: [sneering] I can't.  I gotta take my wife to the ballet.
Lenny: Heh.  You're gonna go see the bear in the little car, huh?
-- People unclear on the concept, 

They walk past a vending machine advertising Crystal Buzz Cola.  "Mmm,"
Homer says, "invisible cola."  When he turns out his pockets, he finds
no change, so he decides it's time to stick it to the man.  As he
reaches up the slot, Carl warns him that someone lost an arm doing the
same thing, but Homer passes it off as an old wives' tale.  Inside the
machine, we see the skeletal remains of another arm with the hand still
clutching a Fresca can.

       [Homer reaches inside a pop machine, grunting]
Homer: Just...a little more...argh...got it!  [realizing] Aah!  I'm
       stuck.  Help me!
 Carl: He's done for!
Lenny: Let's get out of here!
        [They run off screaming]
Homer: [dragging the machine behind him] Must...get to ballet...
       promised...Marge!
-- A man with a mission, 

But Homer can only drag the machine so far.

Hello?  Can I get some help?  Snack-related mishap!
-- Homer with his arm stuck in a vending machine, 

The plant is deserted, and Homer settles down, dejected.  Fortunately,
he has chosen a spot next to a candy vending machine to rest.  "Mmm,
candy..."

Marge sits on the couch, dressed up, waiting for Homer to get home.  The
phone rings, and when she answers it, Homer pleads, "Marge, this may be
hard to believe, but I'm trapped inside two vending
machines..." Marge doesn't believe it, and hangs up.  She offers the
tickets to Patty and Selma, but the ballet is dismissed with a snort as
"girls' stuff".

The doorbell rings, and it's Ruth again.  She returns the sander.

Thanks, Marge.  When my husband left, he took all our power tools along
with the car, my youth, my faith in mankind.
-- Ruth Powers on divorce, 

Marge offers one of the tickets to Ruth, and she accepts.  So the two
drive off to the gymnasium to watch the ballet.  At center-court, a man
and a woman dance.

    Ruth: Vayachipa's loins ought to be outlawed.
   Marge: [snickers]
   Burns: Bah!  Far too much dancing, not nearly enough prancing!
Smithers: A little mincing would be nice...
-- At the ballet, 

The man throws the woman into the air, and the audience gasps.  But she
catches onto the rim of the basket and shatters the backboard -- all
slowly and gracefully, of course.  The buzzer sounds to end the
production, and the audience applauds politely.

Marge: Well, thank you for a lovely time.
 Ruth: You're not going home already, are you?
Marge: Well, it's almost 9:30.
-- Lights out by 10:00, 

{Meanwhile, Homer, still slumped between the vending machines, laments
his predicament.  Rescue workers have tied the area off with yellow
"Police Line" tape.  "I'm gonna have these things on my arms forever,"
he moans, imagining himself at Maggie's wedding as the father of the
bride on stage, tossing free candy and sodas to everyone from the
vending machines still attached to his shoulders.  "Mmm, convenient."}

It's come down to brass tacks for the rescue workers.

  Man: Homer, this...this is never easy to say.  I'm going to have to
       saw your arms off.  [brandishes a buzzsaw]
Homer: [plaintive] They'll grow back, right?
  Man: Oh, er, yeah.
Homer: Whew!
-- He failed anatomy, I guess, 

Just as the man is about to being cutting, another man asks Homer if
he's just holding on to the can.  "Your point being?" queries Homer.  In
the next shot, he slinks away from the plant and the derisive laughter
of the rescue workers, his arms free at last.

Ruth and Marge sit in the "Jittery Joe's Coffee Shop" sipping coffee.

 Ruth: [sighs] I envy you and Homer.
Marge: Thank you.  [realizing] Why?
 Ruth: If you ever met my ex-husband, you'd understand.  All he ever did
       was eat, sleep, and drink beer.
Marge: Your point being?
-- 

  Ruth: [about her ex-husband] To top it off, he's been stiffing me on
        child support for the last four months.
 Marge: Hmm.  Well, you _were_ unlucky.  But there _are_ a lot of good
        men out there.
Barney: Hey!  [to waiter] Can I throw up in your bathroom?  I'll buy
        somethin' --
-- 

When Marge arrives home, Homer tries to explain what happened.

Homer: Marge, I know you didn't believe me about the vending machines.
       That's why I had the firemen write me a note.
Marge: [reads] "Mrs. Simpson, while we were rescuing your husband, a
       lumberyard burned down."
Homer: D'oh!  [sadly] Lumber has a million uses.
-- Even worse, 

Marge: I'm disappointed in you.  But it turns out I had a wonderful time
       with Ruth Powers.  In fact, we're going out again tomorrow night.
Homer: Marge, that's twice.  I think you're spending entirely too much
       time with this woman.
Marge: Homer, please.  You know it's hard for me to make friends.
       {[Flashback to Marge and three women drinking coffee in the
       living room]}
Woman: {Heh heh.  Oh, Marge, we should do this every Thursday.
        [Homer walks in wearing a "No Fat Chicks" T-shirt and Hawaiian
       shorts]}
Homer: {Marge, I got sprayed by this skunk.  Oh, look!  It's doing it
       again.}
-- Respect thy wife, 

Homer: Marge, you can't go out on Saturday!  That's our special night.
Marge: What's so special about it?
Homer: What's so -- [sarcastic] Oh, I don't know.  A little show called
       "Dr. Quinn: Medicine Woman"?
-- Starring Vanna White, 

When Saturday night arrives, Homer watches Marge putting on lipstick.

Homer: Where are you going?
Marge: I don't know.
Homer: When will you be home?
Marge: I'm not sure.
Homer: Where are you going?
Marge: You already asked me that.
-- The long-term effects of TV-watching, 

A horn honks outside the house, and Marge kisses Homer goodbye
instructing him not to wait up.  Homer walks to the front door and
brings the kids with him.

Homer: How can you do this, Marge?  How can you desert your children?
 Lisa: Have a blast, Mom.
 Bart: Rock the Casbah!
Homer: [sneering at Bart] "Man's best friend," indeed.
-- 

Marge is surprised to see Ruth sitting in a blue convertible.  She gets
in.

Marge: You look...nice.
 Ruth: Tonight has nothing to do with "nice".  Tonight's all about --
        [She puts in a tape: "Sunshine, lollipops, and rainbows" --]
       Oh, sorry Marge.  Wrong tape.
        ["Welcome to the jungle!  We got fun and games..."]
-- The jungle that is...Springfield, 

She slams the gas pedal down, and Marge's frightened scream trails off
into the night just ahead of a cloud of dust.

[End of Act One.  Time: 8:12]

Homer still can't get over Marge's leaving.

Homer: I can't believe your mother went out to have fun without me.
 Bart: Don't worry.  You'll feel better once we put your hair up in
       curlers and give you a makeover, [slyly] Homina.
Homer: [falsetto] Oh, that would be delightful --
        [realizing] Quiet, boy!
-- 

Homer: There's nothing to feel ashamed of here.  Women have a right to a
       night out, right, Lisa?
 Lisa: Sure, dad.  [makes a whipping sound]
-- Ball and chain, 

Homer decides to forget the whole thing.

   Homer: That's it!  I'm calling my buddies.  Marge is not the only one
          who can have a girls' night out.  [dials the phone]
   Lenny: Oh, no can do, Homer.  I'm watching the game.
           [Shaves a woman's legs]
   Woman: Shave up, not down, you idiot!
   Burns: Ooh, sounds delish!  Let me just toss some jeans on and --
          wait a minute!  Who is this?
Flanders: Howdily-doodily-do!
           [Homer hangs up]
          Hello?  Y'ello!  Hellodily-odily!
-- Maybe some other night, 

Homer hasn't given up yet.

Homer: Fine.  I can have a great time all by myself.
 Lisa: Hey Dad, I think state and federal laws require us to have a
       babysitter.
Homer: Oh, Lisa.  Haven't you seen "Home Alone"?  If some burglars come,
       it'll be a very humorous and entertaining situation.
 Bart: You're absolutely right, Homer.  We don't need a babysitter!
Homer: [suspicious] Wait a second...
        [Pulls a paper from his pocket: "Always do the opposite of what
       Bart says"] Hmm...you kids _do_ need a babysitter!
 Bart: Blast that infernal card!  [to Homer] _Don't_ give that card to
       me.
Homer: Here you g -- [pulls back] No!
-- Just before Homer leaves, 

The doorbell rings, and Homer answers it.

 Hutz: Mr. Simpson, I was just going through your garbage, and I
       couldn't help overhearing that you need a babysitter.  Of course,
       being a highly-skilled attorney, my fee is $175 an hour.
Homer: We pay eight dollars for the night, and you can take two
       popsicles out of the freezer.
 Hutz: Three.
Homer: Two.
 Hutz: OK, two.  And I get to keep this old bird cage.
Homer: Done!
 Hutz: [proudly] Still got it.
-- 

Marge and Ruth head off to a bar called "Shot Kickers", where,
predictably, the "o" is burned out.  Inside, Marge joins in a country
line dance.  {The first shot inside the bar is shortened by a second in
syndication.}  Willy rides the mechanical bull.  After the dance, Marge
is approached by a largish man.

Cowboy: Hey, baby!  Feel like gettin' lucky?
 Marge: I _am_ lucky.  I have a husband and three wonderful children.
        Thank you very much.
Cowboy: {[threatening] Listen, baby, I _always_ get what I want.}
 Marge: {[indignant] I said no!}
Cowboy: {Oh, did you?  Oh, I completely misunderstood.  Please accept
        our apologies.}
-- A true redneck gentleman, 

Homer has decided to head to Moe's.

Homer: Sometimes, you gotta go where everybody knows your name.
        [walks into Moe's] Hey guys!
        [No one answers; the fan squeaks]
       Moe, get the darts.  I want to play.
  Moe: No.  We're phasing out the games; people drink less when they're
       having fun.
-- Cause and effect, 

{At the Simpson house, Bart and Lisa watch "LA Law" with Lionel Hutz.}

{Oh, sure, like lawyers work in big skyscrapers and have secretaries.
Look at him!  He's wearing a belt.
 [wistfully] That's Hollywood for ya.}
-- Lionel Hutz on "LA Law", 

{The next stop for the ladies is an underground club, "The Hate Box".
The clientele seems to be mostly punk rockers and weirdos.  Inside, a
punk woman with a purple mohawk asks Marge, "Don't you think your hair's
a bit much?"  Otto greets Marge as well.}

Otto: {Hey, Mrs. Simpson!  You should try one of these "Smart Drinks."
       [laughs and drinks it]
      Ooh, wow...I've wasted my life!}
-- Otto, realization dawning, 

{Diamond Joe Quimby is also at the club -- with no shirt on, and paint
blotches on his body.}

Quimby: {Would you, er, like to dance?}
 Marge: {Mayor Quimby!  What are you doing here!}
Quimby: {I'm, er, here with my nephews.}
-- Remind you of anyone?, 

{Homer is in the Kwik-E-Mart, and he notices a "Jet" magazine.  He's
delighted to discover it's Garrett Morris' birthday, but Apu kicks him
out, curtly informing him, "This is not a library."  At the library, the
librarian does the same thing, informing him, "This is not a Kwik-E-
Mart".}

Meanwhile, the two women have stopped the car in a field.

Marge: What was it you wanted to show me?
 Ruth: This.  [pulls a gun]
Marge: [gasps] You're not going to hunt me for sport, are you?
-- No, for meat, 

Ruth tells her to relax.  "I'd never turn a gun on a human being.  My
husband, on the other hand --" She pulls the trigger a few times, aiming
for (and hitting) a set of old cans perched on a fence.  She offers the
gun to Marge, who refuses at first, but then takes it and fires it,
hitting one of the remaining cans.  "I hit it!  I hit i!" she exclaims,
but a man appears, mourning, "My cans!  My precious antique cans!"

Ruth suggests they turn in, but Marge insists, "It's only midnight.
Come on!  I know a place."  They go to a hill where the word
"SPRINGFIELD" is spelled in giant letters.  They gaze down at the lights
of the city below.

Marge: Beautiful, huh?  Homer and I used to come up here on dates.
        [Flashback to said date, where Homer brandishes a thick stick]
       Homer, stop that!  It's just a weather station.
Homer: Come on, Marge!  It's fun to smash things.  [hits it] Heh heh, I
       smashed it good!  [laughs some more]
        [to Marge] You got real purty hair...
-- A hopeless romantic, 

Ruth confesses, "Of all the places we've been tonight, I think I like
this one the best," and Marge concurs.

 Ruth: [pointing] Look, you can see our houses.
Marge: Hmm.  There's an awful lot of black smoke coming from my chimney.
 Lisa: Mr. Hutz, why are you burning all your personal papers?
 Hutz: As of this moment, Lionel Hutz no longer exists.  Say hello to
       Miguel Sanchez!
-- Lawyers can change legal names easily, 

Marge: Maybe we should call it a night.
 Ruth: OK.  I _should_ get home to my daughter before that naked talk
       show comes on.
-- The one with bacon on the beach?, 

Homer happens by as the two drive off, and he sighs, "Ah: young love."

 Homer: The old make-out place.  Hey, a new weather station!  I'll bash
        it good!  [sighs] Oh, it's just no fun without Marge.
Wiggum: Ah, there's nothing like moonshine from your own still.
        [notices Homer] Oh, Simpson!  [tosses the moonshine] What are
        you doing here?
 Homer: [bitter] My wife is having a girls' night out.
Wiggum: Aw, just get one of those inflatable women.  But make sure it's
        a woman, though, because one time I...heh.
-- Another story not suitable for children, 

Wiggum offers Homer a ride home.  On the road, Wiggum pulls slowly up
behind a blue convertible.  "Hmph.  Their left taillight's a little
smaller than their right one.  I better pull 'em over," he says, turning
on the siren and the flashing lights.

In the blue convertible, Marge sees the police car and says, "I think
they want us to stop."  But Ruth is unwilling because the convertible is
stolen.  So she guns it, speeding ahead of the pursuing cop.  "Looks
like we got ourselves an old-fashioned car chase," grins Wiggum, putting
in a tape and singing along.  "Sunshine, lollipops and rainbows:
everything that's wonderful is what I feel when we're together.
Brighter than a lucky penny; when you're near the rainclouds disappear
and I feel fine..." Homer joins in the singing.

[End of Act Two.  Time: 14:25]

Wiggum is still in hot pursuit.

Marge: Ruth, is there something you want to tell me?
 Ruth: Remember when I said my ex-husband was behind on his child
       support?
Marge: Uh huh.
 Ruth: Well, to even things up, I kind of stole his car.
Marge: Didn't you realize all you had to do was report him to the
       police?
 Ruth: Marge, you're the level-headed friend I never had.
-- Small consolation, 

Wiggum: We're in pursuit of two female suspects.  One is wearing a green
        dress, pearls, and has a lot of blue hair.
 Homer: A lot of blue hair?  Hee hee -- what a freak!
-- A freak that _you_ found her, 

But Homer figures it out...

 Homer: ...it's Marge!  She's become a crazed criminal just because I
        didn't take her to the ballet.
Wiggum: That's _exactly_ how Dillinger got started.
 Homer: [interested] Really?
-- You learn something new every day, 

Marge tries to make Ruth see reason.

Marge: I don't want to be a wet blanket, but maybe you should give
       yourself up.
 Ruth: Marge, it's a matter of principle.  I just can't let that
       deadbeat win again.  You're with me, aren'tcha?
Marge: [thinking] I should say something reassuring and noncommittal.
       [spoken] Hmm.
-- Reassuring..._and_ noncommittal, 

Ruth wants to be reasonable.

  Ruth: Look, Marge, there's no reason for you to get dragged into this.
        Once we lose the cops, I'll let you out.
 Marge: Well, I don't think they'll be that easy to lose.  These are
        professional lawmen, and --
         [Ruth turns the car's lights off]
Wiggum: Oh my God!  It just disappeared.  It's a ghost-car!  [slams on
        the brakes]
        There are ghost-cars all over these highways, you know.
 Homer: [timid] Hold me.
Wiggum: [conciliatory] Only if you hold me.
-- You first, 

A coyote howls, and the two men hold one another, quivering.

Ruth lets Marge off at a truck stop, "The Seething Sisters".

Marge: [uncertain] Well, goodbye.
 Ruth: I'm...sorry about all this.  But you gotta admit, we _did_ have
       some fun.
Marge: Yeah...everything before the high-speed chase was just lovely.
-- 

Ruth assures her, "You're a good friend, Marge," as Marge enters the
building.  Once inside, Marge is about to dial a cab, but she overhears
some women talking.

 Woman 1: [to Woman 2] This cross-country flight from the law would be
          hell if we didn't stick together.
 Woman 2: Hey: friends _stick_ together.
 Woman 3: [to Woman 4] It's amazing how through all this adversity, we
          managed to stick together.
 Woman 4: If there's _one thing_ decent folk do, it's stick together.
Waitress: I hate it when the waffles stick together.
    Cook: Stickin' together is what good waffles do.
-- Philsophy in a truck stop, 

Ruth is getting the car gassed up, but before she can leave, Marge
rejoins her.  "Marge!  What are you doing?"  Marge begins to explain how
she considers Ruth a friend, "and an important part of friendship is --"
But before she can say "sticking together", Ruth speeds away with her as
the sirens grow louder.

(The siren is actually Kearney on a bicycle with a siren strapped to his
head.  The owner reprimands him for driving away all the business, but
Kearney is unmindful: "See you tomorrow, loser.")

Homer and Wiggum are making breakfast on the cop car's engine.

Wiggum: Mmm, engine-block eggs.  If we can keep these down, we'll be
        sitting pretty.
         [Marge and Ruth whiz by]
 Homer: That's them!
Wiggum: Quiet!  I can't hear the eggs.
-- Wiggum the epicure, 

Back at home, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie are asleep.  Bart is the first to
awaken.

Bart: Hey, it's morning and Mom and Dad aren't home yet.
Lisa: Don't worry, Mr. Hutz is still here to take care of us.  [taps
      him]
Hutz: [wakes up, clears his throat] Don't touch my stuff!  [holds a
      knife]
      Hey, this isn't the YMCA...
-- Survival of the fittest, 

Homer and Wiggum have finished breakfast and are back on the road.

  Wiggum: Dispatch, this is Chief Wiggum, back in pursuit of the
          rebelling women.
Dispatch: All right, your current location?
  Wiggum: Oh, uh, I'm, er, I'm on a road.  Uh, looks to be asphalt...oh,
          geez, trees, shrubs...er, I'm directly under the earth's
          sun...now!
-- No need for GPS satellites, 

Bart and Lisa are watching TV, but their program is interrupted for a
special bulletin.  Kent Brockman appears on the screen.

Kent: We've just received word of a high-speed desert chase.  The
      suspects have been identified as Ruth Powers and Marge Simpson of
      Springfield.
Bart: Cool!
Lisa: I always knew someday Mom would violently rise up and cast off the
      shackles of our male oppressors.
Bart: Ehh, shut your yap.
-- Bart Simpson, Male Oppressor, 

Brockman continues.

At the risk of editorializing, these women are guilty, and must be dealt
with in a harsh and brutal fashion.  Otherwise, their behavior could
incite other women leading to anarchy of biblical proportions.  [Pause]
It's in "Revelations", people!
-- Kent Brockman thumps the bible, 

Suddenly Brockman is cut off, and a still shot of Brockman with the
words, "Technical Difficulties, Please Stand By", appears on the screen.

Ruth and Marge, meanwhile, are only two miles from the state line.  Ruth
is convinced they're going to make it, but a whole lot of police cars
appear, driving rapidly over the hill in front of them.  "My God!  That
must every policeman in Springfield," Marge opines.

 Ruth: I give up.  A single mother can't win in a man's world.
Marge: Ruth, that's a lot of hooey.  It's not over 'till it's over.
        [Grabs the steering wheel, making the car veer off the road]
       I'm sorry, I should have asked first.
-- Always considerate, 

Ruth is inspired by Marge's courage: "We really are going to make it
now!"  But Wiggum and Homer realize something.

Wiggum: Oh, no!  They're headed right for the Grand Chasm!
 Homer: Oh my God!  They're going to drive right into it just to teach
        us men a lesson.  And it's all my fault!
-- A heavy burden, 

Homer grabs a bullhorn and leans out the window of the speeding police
car.

Homer: [into bullhorn] Marge, Marge!
Marge: Homer?
Homer: Look Marge, I'm sorry I haven't been a better husband.  I'm sorry
       about the time I tried to make gravy in the bathtub.  I'm sorry I
       used your wedding dress to wax the car.  And I'm sorry -- oh
       well, let's just say I'm sorry for the whole marriage up to this
       point.
Marge: [to Ruth] You're right: I _am_ lucky to have him.
-- Stand by your man, 

Homer begs Marge not to drive into the chasm.  "Chasm?!"  Ruth and Marge
cry together.  Ruth slams on the brakes, halting the car just before it
tumbles over the precipice.  Homer and Wiggum, on the other hand, aren't
able to stop in time.  Fortunately, the nose of the car lands vertically
in a big pile of garbage.

Wiggum: Hah!  And to think those idiot environmentalists were protesting
        this landfill!
 Homer: It's solid waste...I could kiss you!
         [kisses it] Ew...
         [kisses it] Ooh...
         [kisses it] Argh!
         [kisses it] Ooh...I think _this_ was pizza.
-- With bile topping, perhaps, 

A narrator explains the fate of the main characters.

Narrator: Ruth Powers was tried in Springfield Superior Court.  The
          judge dismissed her ex-husband's auto theft charges and forced
          him to pay all back child support.  Mr. Powers blamed the
          outcome on his lawyer, one Lionel Hutz.
          Lionel Hutz, AKA Miguel Sanchez, AKA Dr. Nguyen Van Falk, was
          paid eight dollars for his thirty-two hours of babysitting.
          He was glad to get it.
          Marge Simpson was charged with a violation of penal code
          section 618A: Wanton Destruction of Precious Antique Cans.
          She was ordered to pay fifty cents to replace the cans, and
          $2000 in punitive damages and mental anguish.
          Homer Simpson was remanded to the custody of the United States
          Army Neurochemical Research Center at Fort Meade, Maryland,
          for extensive testing.
   Homer: Woo-hoo!

The closing credits appear over a police badge, and the theme music is
march-like, with a rhythmic bass line and lots of trumpets.
 EPISODE TITLE: Bart's Inner Child


EPISODE SUMMARY: 
[Syndication cuts are marked in curly braces "{}" and are courtesy of
Ricardo Lafaurie and Frederic Briere.]

At the breakfast table, Bart makes faces at Lisa to annoy her.  She asks
him repeatedly to stop, but he ignores her.  "Mom!"  Lisa calls, "Bart's
making faces!"  Marge asks Bart to stop it and tells Homer to speak to
him.  But Homer's too busy making faces at Santa's Little Helper and
Snowball II.  "Stupid animals," he scoffs.

Tiring of that, Homer picks up the newspaper and sighs, "Ah...the daily
newspaper."  He turns to the "FOR FREE" section.

Ooh!  The Springfield Men's Shelter is giving away sixty soiled
mattresses!
-- Homer reads the "FOR FREE" section of the paper, 

Marge asks Homer why he bothers reading that section of the paper.
"They never have anything good."  But as she finishes, Homer gasps at an
ad he has just spied: "FREE TRAMPOLINE, 534 Center St."

Homer: Oh my God!
 Lisa: What is it?
Homer: Tramapoline!  Trampopoline!  [runs out]
 Bart: He said what now?
Marge: Please, don't bring home any more old crutches!
-- Homer gets excited over a free trampoline, 

Homer drives at breakneck speed to the address given in the paper.  On
the way, he spies a car backing out of a driveway.  "Oh no you don't,"
he vows, "that trampoline is mine!" as he plows into the right rear side
of the other car and knocks it on its side.

Once he arrives, he hastily parks on the other side of the road and
runs, panting, to the front door.  When he pushes the doorbell button,
the noise it makes is the same as the one a bicycle horn makes, and a
jet of water sprays him in the face.  Homer is confused; he presses the
doorbell again, and the same thing happens.  Finally understanding, he
begins to laugh, and holds down the button while a jet of water sprays
him continuously.  He lets it splash over different parts of his head
while he giggles with merriment.

But the owner of the house finally answers the door.  It's Krusty!
"Hey!" he reprimands upon seeing Homer dousing himself, "that seltzer
ain't free!"  Homer is surprised to find who lives in the house:
"Krusty!"  The jovial clown laughs, "That's me!"

Krusty: You here for the trampoline?
 Homer: Yeah.  What's the deal?
Krusty: Well, I used to do a lot of tumbling in my act, but I'm phasing
        it out for more dirty limericks: "There once was a man named
        Enis..."
-- Krusty gives away a trampoline, 

Homer thinks it's too good to be true: "And I can just haul it away,
free?"  Krusty assures him, "It's all yours," and laughs evilly.  Homer
drives away with the trampoline strapped to the roof, and Krusty peeks
out from behind a curtain to make sure Homer is well and truly gone.

Back at home, Bart sits in his room with Santa's Little Helper.  As Bart
pets his dog, he hears a "Hi, son" coming from the direction of his
window.  He looks up, and Homer appears quickly at the window and says,
"Hi, son" again before disappearing again.  "Wow!" exclaims Bart,
realizing Homer is bouncing on the trampoline.  He runs outside to where
Homer has set it up.  Lisa is already watching Homer enjoying himself.
"I can't believe it!" says Bart incredulously.

Dad, this one gesture almost makes up for years of shaky fathering!
-- Lisa, after Homer gets a trampoline for the family, "Bart's Inner
    Child"

The three of them get on the trampoline at the same time and bounce
merrily.

Bart: I will _never_ get tired of this!
Lisa: I'm going to have my wedding here!
-- The children play on the trampoline, 

Marge watches the antics of the three.

Marge: I don't know if this is a good idea.
Homer: Marge, it's the perfect exercise!  It'll double the value of our
       house, and it was free!  Free!
-- Why trampolines are good, 

Marge is still worried: "Are you sure it's safe?"  Homer stops bouncing
and says, "Absolutely.  And this is just the beginning...I've got some
big plans."

In Homer's plans, we see Homer standing below a crudely painted sign
announcing, "Homerland, Admission $50".  He collects the admission fee
from Ralph Wiggum, who's at the head of a long line of children waiting
to get in.  At "Trampoline Wold", Martin, Sherri, Terri, and another boy
bounce happily on the trampoline.  At "Muckville USA", Lewis and two
other children play in a mud pit, while Nelson throws a ball of mud at
one of the children.  At "Fort Adventure", Homer has built a fort out of
the aforementioned soiled mattresses.  As Milhouse crawls out of hit, he
observes, "It smells funny in there."  Homer contradicts him, "No it
doesn't."

Back in the here and now, Homer is charging admission to use the
trampoline.  Otto is currently using it and having a ball.  But he jumps
too close to the edge and lands with his back across the metal frame
with a bone-crunching smash.

Bart: Otto, are you OK?
Otto: Yeah.  Just pop my shoulder back in.  [Bart does so] Thanks,
      little buddy!
-- Otto injures himself on the trampoline, 

Otto sees Wendell has begun jumping on the trampoline, and he rues, "I
lost my turn."  Wendell lands on his stomach with his arm catching on a
spring, and he cries, "Oh!  My arm!"  Ralph jumps next, but his tongue
is hanging out of his mouth while he jumps, and he bites it
accidentally.  Next up are Rod and Todd Flanders

Todd: Each leap brings us closer to God.
 Rod: Catch me, Lord, catch me!
       [They collide and fall onto the ground]
      What have we done to make God angry?
Todd: _You_ did it!
-- The Flanders children jump on the trampoline, 

Milhouse: Stop jumping on me!  I'm hurt.
   Homer: Kids, kids: once you get hurt, move aside and let other people
          jump.
-- Homer lays down the trampoline rules, 

Marge is watching from nearby.  "Homer, this is terrible!"  Homer
sneers, "OK, OK, I'll take care of it," and he hammers a small "Caution"
sign into the ground about twenty feet away.  As he's doing so, he
glances up, and the camera pans to show a huge field full of children
lying on the ground, all no doubt having suffered some terrible injury
at the hands of the trampoline.  "I told you this was a bad idea!"
Marge says angrily, and Homer relents: "All right, all right!  I'll get
rid of the trampoline."

Krusty sits on a rocking chair on his porch as Homer pulls up.

 Homer: Hey, Krusty: I'm bringing back the --
Krusty: [points a shotgun at Homer]
        You just keep right on driving.
-- Homer tries to return the trampoline, 

Homer decides to throw the trampoline off a cliff.  He pushes it over
the edge of one, and it falls down, but it lands on a pillar of rock and
bounces back up.

Homer: That's the last I'll see of Mr. Trampoline.  Yep, it's finally
       gone.
        [a shadow grows above Homer]
        [the trampoline bounces repeatedly off Homer's head, driving his
       feet into the ground]
       {If this were a cartoon, the cliff would break off now.}
-- Physics according to "Road Runner", 

{That night, Homer is still trapped under the trampoline.  A wolf howls
in the background.  "I'm thirsty," Homer whines, but just then, the
cliff finally breaks off, and Homer falls with a yell.}

{Homer's next plan is to use a buzzsaw to slice the trampoline to
pieces.  "Checkmate, Mr. Trampoline," he announces, and runs towards it,
screaming maniacally while the buzzsaw whirls.  Unfortunately, his
extension cord isn't quite long enough, and the cord snaps taut
suddenly, spilling Homer onto his back and causing him to throw the
buzzsaw into the air.  The saw lands on the trampoline and wraps the
cord rapidly around the trampoline in loops.  Marge and Maggie watch as
a big chuck of the kitchen wall is torn loose where the extension cord
was plugged in.}

{All right, all right...you win for now.  But someday you'll _rust_!}
-- Homer vs. the trampoline., 

{Bart walks over to where Homer laughs.}

 Bart: {Dad, you really want to get rid of this trampoline?}
Homer: {Uh huh.}
 Bart: {Observe: a bike lock.
        [je locks the trampoline to a post]
       Now just turn around, and count to three: one, two, three --
        [they turn around to see Snake with a pair of wire cutters]
       Uh, better make it five.}
Snake: {All right!  I got me a bed.}
-- 1,001 uses, 

That night, Homer and Marge lie in bed.

         [Outside]
Kearney: Shh, quiet!  You'll wake up old man Simpson.
  Jimbo: Hey, no more trampoline.
Kearney: Let's jump on the car instead!
-- Appetite for destruction, 

Marge scowls.

Homer: OK, the trampoline was a bad idea.  But you know what?  At least
       I'm out there trying new things.  If it were up to you, all we'd
       ever do is work and go to church.
Marge: That's not true.
Homer: Name one thing you've done in the past month that was fun.
Marge: I can name ten things!  Uh...I made sloppy Joes!
Homer: That's not fun.
-- The importance of being fun, 

The next day, Marge sits down with Bart and Lisa.  "Kids, tell me the
truth -- am I no fun?  Do I just nag all the time?"  Bart and Lisa hum
and haw, and Marge looks worried.  In a flashback, we see various scenes
of Marge: "You should have called, I was very worried...We're on a tight
budget here...Bart, watch your language!...You are not going to perform
that operation yourself..." Afterwards, Homer says triumphantly, "See,
Marge?"

   Marge: Hmm...I didn't realize people saw me that way.
    Lisa: Are you mad?
   Marge: No, I'm fine.  I'm going to my sisters' now.
           [She runs out and drives away]
Flanders: [cheerily] Careful there, Marge, you almost nicked me!
-- Marge deals with being a nag, 

At their house, Marge's sisters take care of her.

Patty: Your blood pressure is off the chart.
Selma: And I don't like this urine sample one bit.
-- The sisters inspect Marge, 

"You're headed for a nervous breakdown," warns Patty.  "You need Brad
Goodman!" she opines, and Selma adds, "His infomercial plays 'round the
clock on channel 77."

Thank you, Martha Quinn.  [Audience applauds]
There you have it: unrehearsed testimonies from important celebrities.
She's one of my favorites.  I loved her in the thing I saw her in.
-- Brad Goodman on his infomercial, 

Goodman continues his monologue.

Goodman: You know, my course can help you with every personality
         disorder in the "Feel Bad Rainbow."  Let's look at the rainbow;
         what's in there?  [reads list] Depression, insomnia, motor-
         mouth, darting eyes, indecisiveness, decisiveness, bossiness,
         uncontrollable falling down, geriatric profanity disorder (or
         GPD), and chronic nagging...nagging...nagging...
          [Close up shot of Marge]
  Selma: Sorry, it does that sometimes.  [hits the TV]
-- Nine things in the seven-colored rainbow, 

[End of Act One.  Time: 7:16]

Homer walks into the living room, swinging his arms as though he's doing
the front crawl.  "What up, Marge?" he queries.  "I'm watching a
videotape that could change our lives," Marge explains, as the title of
the video appears on the TV: "Adjusting Your Self-O-Stat."

Oh, hi!  I'm Troy McClure.  You might remember me from such self-help
videos as "Smoke Yourself Thin" and "Get Confident, Stupid".  Well, now
I'm here to tell you about the only real path to mental health.  That's
right, it's the Brad Goodman [squints at cue cards] something-or-
other...
-- Troy McClure introduces "Adjusting Your Self-O-Stat", "Bart's Inner
    Child"

Homer scratches his arm nervously, and asks Marge if he can go outside
and play.  Marge shushes him, and the video continues.

{A few weeks ago, I was a washed-up actor with a drinking problem.  Then
Brad Goodman came along and gave me this job and a can of fortified
wine!
 [drinks from a can] Ah...sweet liquor eases the pain.}
-- Troy McClure describes how self-help aided him, 

Troy: And now I'd like to introduce the man who will put the "you" in
      "impr-you-vement"...Brad Goodman!
Brad: {Thank you so much, Troy.  And by the way...I'm not happy you're
      still drinking.  But at least you're down to one from more than
      fifty.}
-- 

Brad: Folks, I'm often asked about my qualifications.  Well, I may not
      have a lot of "credentials" or "training", but I tell you one
      thing: I'm a Ph.D. in pain.  Now let me show you how you can
      change your life.
       [Steps to a blackboard] Troy, this circle is you.  [draws one]
Troy: My God, it's like you've known me all my life!
-- Accurate characterizations, 

At the end of the video, Troy hugs Brad: "Doctor, you've solved all my
problems."  He chugs what's left of his wine, and reaches his finger
inside the glass to get the last couple of drops.

Marge: That video really opened my eyes.  I can see that I'm just a
       passive-aggressive co-culprit.  By nagging you when you do
       foolish things, I just enable your life script.
Homer: And that sends me into a shame spiral.
Marge: Exactly!
-- Following their bliss, 

Marge vows, "From now on, I'm going to stop nagging and have more fun."
The next day, Homer reads "Owning Your Okayness" when Marge pops her
head into the room.

Marge: Homer, did you eat my whole pan of brownies?
 Bart: Uh oh.  You're in for it now, Dad.
Homer: Marge, I'm feeling a lot of shame right now.
Marge: I'm hearing that you feel a lot of shame.
Homer: And I feel that you hear my shame.
Marge: I'm feeling annoyance and frustration, but also tolerance.
Homer: I feel validated by that.
Marge: Good!  I'm glad we had this talk.
Homer: Me too.  [walks off whistling]
-- The new problem-tackling paradigm, 

Homer reads the "FOR FREE" column once again.

Wow, for free!  Surplus drums of mayonnaise from operation Desert Storm!
-- Homer finds more good free stuff, 

Marge glances at the column, and gasps, "Brad Goodman is coming to
town!"  But Homer thinks they're fine now and have no need of Brad
Goodman.  However, Bart sits on a chair whose leg is in the trash
compactor and rides it as though it were a mechanical bull.

Homer: Well, here we are at the Brad Goodman lecture.
 Lisa: We know, Dad.
Homer: I just thought I'd remind everybody.  After all, we did agree to
       attend this self-help seminar.
 Bart: What an odd thing to say...
-- Homer's new directness approach, 

Inside the Springfield Community Center, everyone applauds as Brad
Goodman walks onto the stage.  He approaches the microphone on a lectern
in front of a sign: "Brad Goodman's Inner Child Workshop."

  Brad: Thank you.  OK, folks.  Let me hear what's troubling you.  Don't
        be shy, yell it out.  Everybody, go!
Quimby: I, er, can't commit to a relationship.
 Burns: I'm too nice!
   Apu: I have problems with --
 Lenny: I'm always interrupting people!
-- The "Inner Child Workshop", 

Right now, I want each of you to try something interesting.  There's no
trick to it -- it's just a simple trick!
-- Brad Goodman at the "Inner Child Workshop", 

 Brad: Now, close your eyes for a moment and really listen to that inner
       voice inside, your inner child.  Listen!  What's he saying?
  Ned: [inside] Stay the course, big Ned.  You're doing super!
Homer: [inside] Food goes in here!  [spoken] It sure does.
  Moe: [inside] Hey, Moe, what's-a-matter?  You no talka with you accent
       no more.  [spoken] Mama mia!
-- The inner children speak, 

   Brad: Principal Skinner, let's try some rage work.  I want you to
         pretend this dummy right here is your mother.
Skinner: OK, I'll try.
   Brad: Tell this dummy mother exactly how you feel right now.
Skinner: I'm annoyed with you, Mother.  Not just annoyed -- angry!  I'm
         a grown man now [yelling] and I can run my own life!
          [Tears at the dummy with his teeth]
   Brad: Calm down, calm down.  Oh, _moving_.  You can sit down now.
Skinner: [sitting next to his mother] We're still going antiquing on
         Saturday, right, Mother?
-- Open aggression, 

Brad: You see, folks, we're all trying to please someone else.  And as
      soon as you're not a human be-ing, you're a human do-ing.  Then
      what comes next?
Bart: A human go-ing!  [gets up to leave]
-- Bart's syllogism of humanity, 

Mr. Goodman thinks Bart's answer was wonderful, and he calls him up to
the stage.  He asks Bart what made him yell out that remark, but Bart
doesn't know.  Brad asks him again, and Bart explains, "I do what I feel
like."  Brad is clearly impressed: "I couldn't have put it better
myself!"

Brad: People, this young man here _is_ the inner child I've been talking
      about!
Lisa: [incredulous] What?
-- Lisa's slow acceptance, 

Brad: Son, you've never read any of my books, have you?
Bart: [snorts] Earth to boring guy.
       [Audience howls with laughter]
Brad: [laughs] That means "no", huh?  I'm not so old-fashioned.
-- Grace under pressure, 

Brad congratulates Marge and Homer: "Your parents have done a fantastic
job.  Momma, poppa, could you come up here?"  They walk up onto the
stage while the audience cheers.  Homer has one candy apple in each
hand, and he says as he walks onto the stage, "Thank you, thank you very
much!"

 Brad: This is really remarkable.  Here we have a man with an obvious
       eating disorder, and a woman with a bizarre hairstyle, I'm sure
       worn only for shock value --
Marge: Erm --
 Brad: -- and yet, they've managed to raise an emotionally healthy son.
       That's fantastic.
Marge: Oh, thank you.
-- Insurmountable odds, 

 Brad: We can all learn a lot from this young man here, this, this --
 Bart: Rudiger.
 Brad: -- Rudiger.  And if we can all be more like little Rudiger --
Marge: His name is Bart.
 Brad: [snaps] His name isn't important!  What's important here is that
       this lad has fully developed ego integrity with well-defined
       boundaries.
 Bart: [snoring noises]
        [Audience laughs]
-- Bart, everyone's obnoxious inner child, 

    Brad: People, I am excited.  I can sense a change in the air
          tonight.  You are all going to start _living_, really
          _living_.
Audience: Yay!  [chanting] Living!  Living!
    Brad: Be like the boy!
Audience: Be like boy!  Be like boy!
    Brad: Just the ladies.
  Ladies: Be like boy!  Be like boy!
    Brad: Now, the seniors in the back.
 Seniors: We like Roy!  We like Roy!
-- Not Roy Cohn, surely?, 

Lisa looks worried.

Lisa: This is madness.  He's just peddling a bunch of easy answers.
Carl: [enthusiastically] And how!
-- Lisa sees through Brad Goodman, 

[End of Act Two.  Time: 14:01]

Kent Brockman delivers "My Two cents".

The winds of change are in the air in Springfield, and it's about as
refreshing as a pre-moistened towlette.  Folks are finally accepting
their feelings and really communicating, with no holding back, and this
reporter thinks it's about [bleep]ing time.  Of course, all these good
vibes can be traced to one feisty little scamp [picture of Bart appears]
who taught us that if it feels good, do it!
-- Kent Brockman's two cents, 

Brockman grabs two cans of whip cream and starts spraying them into his
mouth.  Bart watches with pride.

Bart: Lis, today I am a god.
Lisa: Is that why you're sitting on an ice cream sandwich?
Bart: Eww!
-- Blessed by the holy bottom, 

Santa's Little Helper tries to lick the sandwich off Bart's pants.

At the First Church of Springfield, the sermon topic is "Be Like Unto
the Boy."

Now instead of my boring old sermon, I'm going to take a page from the
Book of Bart to do something I've always wanted to do.
 [Walks over to the organ]
Take five, Mrs. Feesh.
 [Begins playing "The Entertainer" badly] Wait, wait, I can do this...
 [Starts over, playing more wrong notes]
Wait, wait, hold on...
-- Reverend Lovejoy does what he feels like, 

Mrs. Krabappel reads to Bart's class.

    Edna: [reading] "The wireless was an invention by Guglielmo
          Marconi."  Who can tell me what his first message was?
    Bart: Uh --
Milhouse: I want-a change-a my name-a!
           [Everyone laughs]
    Edna: [chuckling] Oh, good one, Milhouse.  Anyone else?  The first
          message by wireless?
    Bart: It was --
  Martin: Our tenth caller will receive tickets to Supertramp!
           [Everyone laughs]
-- Everyone lives like Bart, 

Bart rues, "Aw, geez...everybody's a comedian."  On the way home, Bart
tries to combat his blueness with some of his patented spitting off the
overpass.  But the overpass is already crammed with people doing just
that, while below, cars honk their horns, squeal their tires, and smash
into one another.  Bart goes home and covers his head with a pillow,
groaning.

Bart: Lis, everyone in town is acting like me.  So why does it suck?
Lisa: It's simple, Bart: you've defined yourself as a rebel, and in the
      absence of a repressive milieu your societal nature's been co-
      opted.
Bart: [pause] I see.
-- Said the blind man, 

Lisa: Ever since that self-help guy came to town, you've lost your
      identity.  You've fallen through the cracks of our quick-fix, one-
      hour photo, instant oatmeal society.
Bart: What's the answer?
Lisa: Well, this is your chance to develop a new and better identity.
      May I suggest...good-natured doormat?
Bart: Sounds good, sis.  Just tell me what to do.
-- Lisa consoles Bart, 

Springfield will have its first annual "Do What You Feel" Festival this
Saturday, whenever you feel like showing up!  It'll be a welcome change
from our annual, "Do As We Say" Festival started by German settlers in
1946.
-- Kent Brockman's residual bitterness, 

As workmen prepare the town square for the festival, Willy stands at a
microphone.

  Willy: If elected mayor, my first act will be to kill the whole lot of
         you and burn your town to cinders.
Workman: [whispering] The mike's on.
  Willy: I know it's on!
-- Don't delay, vote today, 

{Otto is in charge of parking.  "Park anywhere!  I'm not gonna lay any
rules for anybody today."  The cars are arranged in a jumbled mass,
scattered hither and thither.}

The camera pans across the fairground.  Someone has tied a red helium
balloon to the Jebediah Springfield statue's hand, while Ralph and Janey
sit at his feet.  Lenny throws a frisbee; Corporal Punishment eats
cotton candy; Dr. Marvin Monroe eats popcorn; Carl and Ned Flanders play
the steel drums while Wiggum conducts and drones along.  Burns and
Smithers eat ice cream.

   Burns: I feel like such a free spirit, and I'm really enjoying this
          so-called..._iced_ cream.
Smithers: Sir, in the spirit of the festival and everything, I'd just
          like to say that...[clears throat]...I...love you.
   Burns: Hmm?
Smithers: [hastily] In those colors!  [aside] Oh, who am I kidding?  The
          boathouse was the time!
-- Plagued by doubt and regrets, 

Patty and Selma ride by on a horse -- naked!

   Skinner: My God, they're naked!
     Patty: Double your pleasure, Springfield.
     Selma: I'm sweating...let's ride through the car wash.
  Everyone: Ew!
McAllister: [snapping a photo of them] Arr!  This picture will serve me
            well on those lonely nights at sea.
-- Their biggest fan, 

The Simpsons show up at the fair, Homer in his bath robe and bear
slippers, Marge in pants and climbing shoes.

Homer: This is great...I can finally look like I want, and not get
       hassled by the man!  [Apu and Jamshed ride around the family on
       skateboards]
  Apu: Cowabunga!
 Bart: Skateboards?  You copycat wannabes!
-- The "Do What You Feel" Festival, 

Bart gets hit in the head with an acorn, and he looks up in a nearby
tree to see Principal Skinner with a slingshot: "Eat my shorts, young
man!"

Diamond Joe Quimby stands at the microphone in front of the assembled
crowd with an attractive blonde in a low-cut red dress at his side.

Good afternoon and welcome to the "Do What You Feel" festival.  By the
way, this young lady is not my wife, but I _am_ sleeping with her.  I'm
telling you this because I'm comfortable with my womanizing.
-- Quimby, the Master of Ceremonies, 

Quimby: And now to usher in this new era of feeling good is the
        godfather of soul, James Brown.
 Brown: Ow!  [singing]
        I feel good, huh!
        I knew that I would, now.  How!
        I feel good, good God!
        I knew that I would.  Hah!
        So good!  So good!  I got a-you.  Wow!
         [The bandstand collapses, and everyone gasps]
        Hey, wait a minute.  Hold on here -- this bandstand wasn't
        double-bolted.  Huh.
Worker: I didn't feel like it.
 Homer: Hey, I hear you, buddy.
-- James Brown, closet carpenter, 

Marge: Er, I don't want to judge the rightness of your ego orientation,
       but my inner critic says you should have done your job!
  Ned: Hey, now, Marge, let's not "should" this fellow to death.
-- New-age arguments, 

Willy concurs: "Yeah!  Next you'll be laying a guilt trip on me for not
oiling that ferris wheel."  As he finishes, sparks fly from where the
ferris wheel joins the support, and it breaks off, rolling down the
street and through the gates to the Springfield zoo.  A horde of
ferocious animals burst forth and the crowd screams in panic.

      Quimby: In the spirit of the occasion, I must tell you what I
              think.  You two screwed up royal!
      Worker: Ya know, I really don't feel like being blamed.
     Skinner: I feel that you should shut up!
         Moe: You know, you really irritate me, Skinner, what with your
              store-bought haircut and excellent posture.
Hot- dog boy: Mister, I can't stand the sound of your voice!
         Moe: Oh, really?  [pushes him]
     Hibbert: Oh, now, now: there's no need to resort to violence.
         Moe: Oh, sure there is!  [punches the boy]
-- So much for owning their okayness, 

Everyone starts brawling, and Marge and Rev. Lovejoy watch.

  Marge: I knew it.  If only I had nagged more!
Lovejoy: God is angry: we've made a false idol of this Brad Goodman.
          [Two women in togas hold onto a giant gold statue of Goodman]
-- And the Lord said..., 

Apu is quick to point out that the whole thing is really Bart's fault.
The hot-dog boy yells, "Get him!" and Bart says, "Eep."  He begins
running away.  Fortunately, Homer is hidden inside a "Free as a Bird"
float, and he snatches Bart and hides him in the driver's box inside the
float.  "Hold on, son!" he exhorts, as he slams the gas pedal to the
floor.  The speedometer creeps up to five MPH.

But even this is too fast to hold the colorful tissue on the float.  It
all blows off, leaving just the steel skeleton with Bart and Homer
ensconced in it.  "So long, suckers!"  Homer jeers as they make their
getaway.

Skinner: Damn...they're very slowly getting away!
    Moe: They're heading for the old mill!
  Homer: No we're not.
    Moe: Well, let's go to the old mill anyway -- get some cider!
-- Short attention spans, 

That night, the Simpsons sit together watching TV.

Homer: Aw, boy: if only Bart had been a better role model for everyone.
Marge: That's not fair.  The lesson here is that self-improvement is
       better left to people who live in big cities.
 Lisa: No!  Self-improvement can be achieved, but not with a quick fix:
       it's a long, arduous journey of personal and spiritual discovery.
Homer: That's what I've been saying!  We're all fine the way we are!
-- Homer, master paraphraser, 

    Homer: Ooh!  It's that new show about the policeman who solves
           crimes in his spare time.
     Bart: Crank it, Homer!
    Chief: You busted up that crack house pretty bad, McGonigle.  Did
           you really have to break so much furniture?
McGonigle: You tell me, Chief.  You had a pretty good view from behind
           your desk.
    Homer: Ah, McGonigle: eases the pain.
    Chief: You're off the case, McGonigle!
McGonigle: You're off _your_ case, Chief!
    Chief: What does that mean exactly?
    Homer: [yelling] It means he gets results, you stupid chief!
     Lisa: Dad, siddown.
    Homer: Oh, I'm sorry.

[End of Act Three.  Time: 21:25]
 EPISODE TITLE: Boy Scoutz 'N the Hood


EPISODE SUMMARY: 
[Syndication cuts are marked in curly braces "{}" and are courtesy of
Ricardo Lafaurie and Frederic Briere.]

It's an afternoon at the video arcade!  The arcade is packed with kids,
some even forming long lines as they wait for a game to become free.
Martin plays one of the more intellectual games.

Video Man: Thirsting for a way to name the unnameable, to express the
           inexpressible?
   Martin: [entranced] Tell me more!
-- Martin plays "My Dinner with Andre", 

Meanwhile, Bart plays a rather more violent game while Milhouse watches.

Bart: Be cool, Simpson...but be _in_ the game, not _of_ the game.
 Man: Bwaa!  No es bueno...Bwaa!
       [He gets shot and falls off the building]
       [George Bush walks on the screen and kicks the corpse]
Bush: [robotically] Winners don't use drugs.
-- Bart plays "Panamanian Strongman", 

"GAME OVER" flashes on the screen.  Bart is despondent.

    Bart: Aw, I'm out of money.
Milhouse: Don't say that out loud!
           [Security men watch a bank of TV screens]
   Man 1: Caucasian males out of money in sector four.  Go to code red.
-- Bart and Milhouse at the arcade, 

Each security guard has a key, and they place them into keyholes
simultaneously and turn them clockwise.  In the arcade, a siren goes off
and red lights bathe all the game players in an eerie glow.  Bart and
Milhouse watch as a door opens and a huge shadow walks out of the
blinding white light, smoke billowing around its form as its footfalls
shake the room.  It turns out to be the change boy, and he says, "I'm
sorry, you'll have to leave," as though reading these words off a card.
Bart and Milhouse walk out.

Bart: Oh, man, how are we supposed to kill the rest of the afternoon?
 Bum: You mustn't kill time, boys, you must cherish it.  Seize the
      day!...Can I have some change to go get loaded?
-- Bart and Milhouse get ejected from the arcade, "Boy Scoutz 'N the
    Hood"

At home, Homer is surrounded by books.

Ah, finally a little quiet time to read some of my old favorites...
 [Looks at books, picks up peanut jar]
Honey-roasted peanuts.  Ingredients: "Salt, artificial honey-roasting
agents, [excited] pressed peanut sweepings..." Mmm.
-- Homer reads a literary masterpiece, 

Marge interrupts Homer's fantasy, saying she has to go out to pick up
something for dinner.  "Steak?"  Homer guesses happily, but Marge says
the money's too tight.  "Steak?"  Homer guesses again, and Marge says
with a worried look, "Er, sure, steak..."

Homer turns back to the honey-roasted peanut jar.

Ah, the last peanut -- overflowing with the oil and salt of its departed
brothers.
-- Homer with an almost empty jar of peanuts, 

He tips his head back, closes his eyes, opens his mouth, and tosses the
peanut towards his head, missing his mouth.  The peanut clatters behind
the couch, and after a couple of seconds, Homer observes, "Something's
wrong."  He gets down on his hands and knees in front of the couch and
reaches underneath.

               [Homer searches under the couch for a peanut]
        Homer: Hmm...ow, pointy!
               Eww, slimy.
               Oh, moving!
               Ah-ha!  [looks, then says remorsefully] Oh, twenty
               dollars...I wanted a peanut!
Homer's brain: Twenty dollars can buy many peanuts!
        Homer: Explain how.
Homer's brain: Money can be exchanged for good and services.
-- The voice of reason, 

"Woo hoo!"  Homer chuckles, and he begins to walk out.  But he trips on
the peanut and lands on his fat can.  The $20 flies out of his hand and
blows out the window.  While "Flight of the Bumblebee" plays in the
background, we follow the course of the money as it blows high over
Springfield.

In the parking lot of the arcade, Bart and Milhouse take turns punching
one another in the arm.  Both look bored, and Bart says he thinks it's
wearing a bit thin.  "You think so?" queries Milhouse.  Just then, the
$20 lands in the parking lot five feet in front of them, and Milhouse
points it out.  "Maybe a plane exploded," Bart suggests, but Milhouse is
ecstatic: "Our prayers have been answered!"

The two boys strut into the Kwik-E-Mart.  "Hello gents," Apu says, "what
will it be?"  Milhouse orders a Super Squishy -- "One that's made
entirely out of syrup," Bart adds.  Apu is aghast, as are all the other
customers in the store -- even Snake who holds a bag while he points a
gun at Sanjay.  "An all-syrup Super Squishy?  Oh, s-such a thing has
never been done," Apu explains.  Bart pushes the $20 towards him and
says, "Just make it happen."  Apu complies, with some trepidation.

He grabs a Super-sized cup and twists the knob on the Squishy machine
from "Recommended Dosage" past "Unhealthy Dosage" to "Experimental".
The machine begins to shake as it ejects goopy green liquid into the
cup.  A man runs out of the store in a panic, and Apu sweats, "She won't
hold!  She's breaking up!"  But the machine dings and stops shaking.
"If you survive, please come again!" he says cordially.

The boys cheer as they walk out.  Milhouse forces a straw into the
Squishy, commenting how thick it is.  He tries to drink some of it
through the straw, but he sucks the straw into his throat and his
glasses fly off.  Bart doesn't bother with the straw; he simply drinks
straight out of the cup.  "Whoa!  That's good squishy," he smiles, but
then his eyes start to go wonky and he groans.  His vision trebles, and
three Milhouses ask him, "What's it like, Bart?"  Bart can only stutter
incoherently, and Milhouse grabs the Squishy: "Gimme that!"  He takes a
slurp, then groans himself, and his face twitches.

    Bart: OK, we're young, rich, and full of sugar.  What do we do?
Milhouse: [yelling] Let's go crazy, Broadway style!
           [singing together]
          Springfield, Springfield, it's a hell of a town:
          the schoolyard's up and the shopping mall's down.
          The stray dogs go to the animal pound,
    Bart: Springfield, Springfield!
Milhouse: Springfield, Springfield!
  Sailor: New York, New York!
    Bart: New York is that-a-way, man!
  Sailor: Thanks, kid!
Together: [singing] It's a hell of a...toooown!
-- Painting the town green, 

The two young men have a hell of a time: first, they go to the
skateboard park, where a man in a suit shows Bart a skateboard for his
approval.  At the VIP video game room, Milhouse plays two games at once
while a garcon brings him a drink.  The boys go to see "Cats" next, and
Bart mischieviously starts a cat-fight by spitting some Squishy at one
of the actors.  Then, they buy lots of packs of "Toothless Joe"-brand
bubblegum-flavored chewing product and blow immense bubbles with it --
so immense that when the bubbles burst, they are covered with pink
stuff.  Homer happens by, and he sticks his finger in it and licks it
off.  "Mmm, free goo."

At the 24-hour rub-on tattoo parlor, Bart gets a cobweb and bat on his
right arm and a snake on his left arm, while Milhouse has a woman on his
right arm, a globe on his left arm, and a fiery skull on his torso.  As
they leave, Barney is seen to be walking behind them.

I don't know where you magic pixies came from...but I like your pixie
drink!  [drinks some squishy]
-- Barney to Milhouse and Bart, 

Apu's laughing face appears while images whirl by: a "Models and Model
Decals" store, a triple-G rated movie theater, a "Sweet tooth" sign, a
"Come on in" sign, "Bootleg Records", "All Nite Arcade", and a "Booking"
and a "Batting" sign.  Then, the signs begin to blur as they spin around
faster.

The next morning, Bart wakes up on his bed, under a blanket.

Bart: [groans] Oh, my head.
Lisa: Tsk, tsk, tsk, the remorse of the sugar junkie.
Bart: Ohh...I don't remember anything.
Lisa: Really?  Not even...this?  [pulls back the covers]
       [Bart is dressed as in a uniform]
Bart: Aah!  Oh, no!  I must have joined the Junior Campers.
Lisa: The few, the proud, the geeky.  [laughs unsympathetically]
Bart: Boy, a man on a Squishy bender can sure do some crazy things.
-- Bart considers a membership in Squishyholics Anonymous, "Boy Scoutz
    'N the Hood"

{Barney would agree with Bart's latter utterance: he wakes up on a boat,
his bed a bunch of sacks with baklava in them, his attire a blue-and-
white horizontally-striped sailor suit complete with blue hat and pom-
pom.  "Uh oh," he rues, "not again!"}

[End of Act One.  Time: 5:48]

At the breakfast table that morning, Bart reconciles his behavior.

 Bart: OK, look: I made a terrible mistake.  I wandered into a Junior
       Camper recruitment center, but what's done is done: I've made my
       bed, and ow I've got to weasel out of it.
Marge: I know you think the Junior Campers are square and "uncool", but
       they also do a lot of neat things, like sing-alongs and flag
       ceremonies.
Homer: Marge, don't discourage the boy.  Weaseling out of things is
       important to learn.  It's what separates us from the animals!...
       except the weasels.
-- The morning after the Squishy bender, 

At school, Bart thinks he has a solution to his problem.

    Bart: All I've got to do is take this uniform back after school.
Milhouse: You're lucky.  You only joined the Junior Campers; _I_ got a
          dirty word shaved into the back of my head.
 Skinner: [gasps] What is it with you kids and that word?  I'm going to
          shave you bald, young man, until you learn that hair is not a
          right: it's a privilege!
-- The curse of the toupee, 

Nelson: What's in the bag, wuss?  [grabs it from Bart]
        Oh, look: [contemptuously] Campers' Pampers.  Heh.
         [Dolph, Jimbo, and Kearney appear, and the four bullies start
        to play "Keepaway!"]
  Bart: Yeah, whatever.  [walks away]
 Jimbo: [blocking his path] You better pretend you want your uniform
        back, twerp!
  Bart: [gulps]
         [The bullies begin to play Keepaway again]
  Bart: [half-hearted] Oh, no.  Woe is me.  My precious uniform.
-- Oozing sincerity, 

  Edna: Guess what, class?
Martin: Time for a surprise quiz?
  Edna: Well, that's not what I was going to say, but it's a good idea.
        Hah!
-- Thank you, Mr. Prince, 

  Edna: Take out a sheet of paper, books under your desk.
Warren: [whining] I'm supposed to -- I've got -- I'm supposed to --
  Edna: Oh, Warren, I nearly forgot.  All Junior Campers are excused to
        attend their patrol meeting.
  Bart: [hastily putting on the uniform] Um, Mrs. Krabappel, I-I'd love
        to stay, but this uniform carries certain responsibilities.
Nelson: Hey, look: sergeant Dork!  Ha-ha!
  Bart: [slyly] Enjoy your test.
Nelson: Ha-h -- [realizing] Aw!
-- Saved by the skin of his teeth, 

Bart walks up to the meeting room door: "Junior Campers Meeting Room,"
it reads, "Not affiliated with the Boy Scouts of America."

  Bart: Hello, alternative to testing!
         [Opens the door, sees Ned Flanders] Ohh...
   Ned: Well, it's Bart Simpson...come on in!  You're just in time for
        "Sponge Bath the Old Folks" Day!
Jasper: Help yourself...but stay above the equator!
-- Frightening introductory activities, 

Bart screams and tries to run out, but his necktie gets caught in the
door and it chokes the air out of him.  As he comes to, he hears Ned
explaining, "Now, just breathe into him every three seconds.  Make sure
you form a tight seal around his mouth!"  A plump child does as Ned
suggests, and Bart tries to protest, but the sound is blocked by the
other kid's mouth.  Bart pushes him off and coughs, and the kid turns to
Flanders uncertainly: "Should I keep doing it?"

 Ned: Well sir, just apply a smidgen of peanut butter to an ordinary
      pinecone and you've got yourself a makeshift bird feeder, sir!
Bart: I'm outta here, man.  [starts to leave]
 Ned: OK, now everybody take out your Junior Campers' pocket-knives.
Bart: Huh?  [excited] You guys get to play with knives?  [grabs one of
      the other kids' knives] Aw, cool: a spork!
 Kid: Don't hurt me!
-- Bart at a Junior Campers meeting, 

But Ned is quick with kind reproach: "Oops, sorry Bart.  That's a Neddy
no-no!  You're not allowed to handle a pocket-knife till you read this
booklet on knife safety and pass a test."  Bart feels sour grapes as he
looks at the booklet's title: "The 10 Do's and 500 Don'ts of Knife
Safety," and he scoffs, "Aw, who needs a cruddy knife anyway?"  A
rhetorical question, it would seem.

{On the way home, he walks past Moe's, muttering, "Knives are boring."
Just then, a man flies out the door, followed by Moe, who holds (guess
what?) a knife!}

 Moe: {When I say, "Put your beer on a coaster," I mean it!}
Hans: {You call that a knife?  This is a knife!  [pulls a huge blade
      from his cane]
       [It's too heavy for him to hold up]
       [weakly] Ooh, down I go.}
-- Crocodile Moleman, 

Next, Bart comes across Martin.  "Oh, hi Bart!  I'd gladly share these
sweet cookies with you, if only you would help me remove this ribbon."
Jimbo happens by, and he volunteers his knife.  He cuts the ribbon, and
Martin thanks him, opening the box and suggesting everyone share the
goodness.  "Share this!"  Kearney exclaims, pushing Martin in a puddle
while Jimbo grabs the box.  The bullies run off with the cookies,
cackling.

Bart happens upon a crowd of people surrounding a man who is clearly in
pain.  Dr. Hibbert kneels over the man and his diagnosis is that the
man's appendix is about to burst.  "Luckily, I have my trusty pocket-
knife," the doctor smiles, making an incision and removing the inflamed
organ.  The crowd gasps, and he implores, "Stand back!" as he tosses the
appendix away.  It explodes with a flash, and everyone cheers the
doctor's quick operation.  "Thank you, Dr. Hibbert," says the man.
"Don't thank me," the doctor laughs, "thank the knife!"

Bart notices a trend: "Seems like everywhere I go, people are enjoying
knives."  So he relents and opens the book Ned gave him.

"Don't do what Donny Don't does"...[sighs] They could have made this
clearer.
-- Bart reads a knife safety book, 

Things not to do, according to the book, are use your knife as a
toothbrush, use your knife in a slingshot, or threaten your cat while it
sleeps.  "Oh, they won't let you have any fun," Bart moans.  Homer walks
by and sees what Bart is doing.

Homer: [scoffing] Well, if it isn't the leader of the wiener patrol,
       boning up on his nerd lessons.
Marge: Homer, you should be more supportive.
Homer: You're right, Marge.  Good work, boy.  [ruffles his hair]
        [Marge leaves]
        [singing] Egghead likes his booky-books!
Marge: Homer!
Homer: Just tucking him in.
-- Homer, master of tolerance, 

Here you go: your rubber training knife.  You've attained the rank of
"pussy willow"!
-- Ned to Bart the Junior Camper after Bart passes a knife safety test,
    

"Rubber knives?"  Bart is incredulous.  "This place is for wimps!"  He
starts to walk out again, but Ned says, "OK kids, now I'm gonna teach
you how to trap wild animals."  Bart pauses, his hand on the doorknob.
"This should only be used in life-or-death situations," cautions Ned.
Bart gets an idea.

Homer walks by the kitchen door and he notices a piece of cherry pie on
a plate on the floor.  He walks over to it..."Ooh!  Floor pie!"  As he
reaches for it, a noose of rope on the floor which he didn't notice
tightens around his ankle, and he is slung up from the ceiling, dangling
back and forth upside down.  Santa's Little Helper gobbles the pie up,
but all Homer can do is watch impotently.

Bart has now earned five badges: archery, debt collecting, embalming, TV
trivia, and his latest, patch forgery, which he sews onto his sash.

When Homer arrives home from work one day, he sees a pie on top of a
green blanket on the driveway.  He hops out of the car and onto the
blanket, but the blanket's purpose was to conceal a pit in the driveway.
Homer, the pie, and the blanket all fall into it.  "Bart!" he yells
angrily, {but he soon forgets his anger: "Mmm, apple."}

Lisa and Bart watch an Itchy and Scratchy cartoon, "Aaahhh!
Wilderness!"  In it, Scratchy plays the guitar in front of a campfire
while Itchy roasts a marshmallow.  It begins to rain and the fire goes
out.  So Itchy grabs some tent pegs and hammers them through Scratch's
feet and hands.  He then puts a stick under Scratchy's stomach to hold
it up, and ties the cat's tongue onto one peg and hammers another
through his tail.  Itchy then lies down under Scratchy's body as though
it was a tent.  Although he is dry, the unfortunate Scratchy gets hit
repeatedly by lightning.

Lisa finds it amusing, but Bart points out an error: "The guys who wrote
this show don't know squat.  Itchy should have tied Scratchy's tongue
with a taut-line hitch, not a sheet bend."  Lisa is nonplussed: "Oh,
Bart, cartoons don't have to be 100% realistic."  Just as she finishes
saying this, Homer walks by the window -- despite the fact that
(another?)  Homer already sits on the couch.

 Ned: {Howdely-hey, Camper Bart.  Ready for today's meeting?}
Bart: {You knowdely-know it, Neddy.}
 Ned: {Okily dokily.}
-- Bart learns Nedspeak, 

     Ned: Our annual father-son rafting trip is next weekend.
    Bart: [thinking] Oh no, me bring Homer on a rafting trip?
           [In Bart's imagination, Homer wears a paper sailor hat and
          faces the wrong way in the raft]
   Homer: Duh, I'm the captain.  My son is Bart.  [splashes everyone
          with his oar]
Father 1: What an oaf!
Father 2: How embarrassing.
  Camper: Glad he's not _my_ father.
-- Nightmare rafting trips, 

Bart shudders at the thought.  Another camper seems unhappy.

   Ned: Oh, Warren, I know your dad is in prison, but don't you fret!  A
        special celebrity dad has been arranged for you.
Warren: But -- my older brother would like --
   Ned: [cheerfully] Sorry, but I'm afraid Ernest Borgnine has already
        been confirmed.
         [Ernest Borgnine walks in laughing]
Ernest: Hiya!  I'm sure you kids know me best as Sergeant Fatso Judson
        in "From Here to Eternity".
         [The kids except for Bart and Warren cheer]
-- Or not, 

Bart walks into the living room at home while Marge knits.

Homer: How was jerk practice, boy?  Did they teach you how to sing to
       trees?  And build crappy furniture out of useless wooden logs?
       Huh?
        [His chair collapses] D'oh!  Stupid poetic justice.
 Bart: Actually, we were just planning the father-son river rafting
       trip.
Homer: Heh heh, you don't have a son.
-- People unclear on the concept, 

Bart goes up to his room to mull it over.

         Bart: [to himself] Look, Homer won't want to go, so just ask
               him and he'll say "No."  Then it'll be his fault.
        Homer: [to himself] I don't want to go, so if he asks me to go,
               I'll just say, "Yes!"
Homer's brain: Wait!  Are you sure that's how this sort of thing works?
        Homer: Shut up, brain, or I'll stab you with a Q-tip!
         Bart: [through clenched teeth] Dad, I really want you to come
               on this trip with me.
        Homer: [through clenched teeth] Bart, I'd be delighted to go on
               your trip with you.
 Bart &amp; Homer: D'oh!
-- The rafting trip showdown, 

Warren seems less than impressed about his assigned celebrity dad, and
Ernest tries to cheer him up.  "Aw, come on, kid: quit crying!  It'll be
fun, I promise!"  He laughs, but it tapers off sheepishly.

McAllister: Arr, here be a fine vessel -- the yarest river-going boat
            there be.
     Homer: I'll take it!
             [The raft sinks]
McAllister: [sadly] Arr, I don't know what I'm doing.
-- The truth comes out, 

  Ned: Okey dokey, every dad find a partner.  Two dads to a raft.
        [All dads except Homer shake hands and smile at one another]
Homer: Please not Flanders, please not Flanders, please not Flanders --
  Ned: Well, Homer, looks like we're boat-buddies, huh?  Want me to zinc
       your sniffer?
-- A fate worse than death, 

They all depart.  The river is a fast-moving one, and everyone has to
work at directing their rafts.

  Ned: Well, I guess now we know why they call them "rapids" and not
       "slowpids", huh?
 Bart: [appreciative] Ha, ha!
Homer: You are not my son!
-- Bart gets disowned in the raft, 

A little further down the river, Flanders searches through his pack.

  Ned: Now, what happened to that gosh-darn map I brought?
        [said map is on Homer's head as a sailor's hat.  It blows off]
Homer: Um, I dunno...but lucky for you _somebody_ here is responsible.
        [pulls out a "Krusty Burger Fun Map"]
       Hey, there's a _New_ Mexico.
-- Useful geography trivia, 

The raft rapidly approaches a fork in the river.  "Quick, Homer: which
way do we turn?"  But Homer is engrossed with the number of Krusty
Burger locations on the map.  Ned is forced to pick a path on his own.
He chooses the left one, but everyone else goes down the right side.
"Hey," wonders Ernest aloud, "where are the sissy and the bald guy
going?"

Homer, Bart, Ned, and Todd are swept over a few waterfalls, but
eventually they end up at the mouth of the sea.  "Paddle harder, Homer,
we gotta fight the current!"  Homer disagrees vehemently.  He grabs
everyone's paddle and says, "In a situation like this you just relax and
let the current take you back to land."  He lies back with his hands
behind his head.  But the land recedes from view rapidly until they are
in the middle of the ocean.  Homer stands up, looks worried for a
moment, then says quietly, "D'oh."

[End of Act Two.  Time: 15:12]

       [Homer dances on a beach with ice cream cones and lollipops]
Homer: [singing] Sugar, do-do-do do, do do,
       Oh, honey honey, do-do-do do, do do,
       You are my candy girl...
        [batteries in walkman run down]
       Lousy piece of junk!  [throws it into the water]
 Todd: Hey...I got that for my birthday!
Homer: Now I have to face stupid reality again.
-- Homer's escapism, 

   Homer: Flanders!  My socks feel dirty.  Give me some water to wash
          them.
Flanders: Again?  Homer, we have to ration the water carefully.  It's
          our only hope!
   Homer: Oh, pardon me, Mr. "Let's ration everything", but what d'you
          think we're floating on?  Don't you know the poem?  "Water,
          water, everywhere, so let's all have a drink."
-- The Rime of the Modern Homer, 

He begins to slurp up the salt water, and the other three campers have
to restrain him.

   Homer: Oh, what does it matter, we're doomed!
           [a seagull flies into view]
Flanders: Wrong, we're saved!  Seagulls always stay near land.  They
          only go out to sea to die!
           [it squawks and spirals into the ocean]
   Homer: [triumphant] Woo-hoo!  See that, boy?  Your old man was right,
          not Flanders.  We _are_ doomed!  In your face, Flanders!
-- Extreme grudge-holding, 

Bart is quick to point out, "Well, at least Ned is trying.  What are
_you_ doing to help?"  Homer gets bitter: "Since you're all such a big
bunch of big ration babies, I'll just be in charge of the rationing."
He grabs the ration box and begins to explain that the secret is to take
tiny bites.  At first he demonstrates by nibbling at some rations
tentatively, but then he crams them by double handfuls into his mouth.
Everyone has to restrain him forcibly, and Homer sobs, "Why couldn't I
be on one of the smart rafts?  I bet they're having the time of their
life."  He would lose his bet, however: the other rafts travel slowly
between dark, ominous forests which emit rustling noises.

{Chief Wiggum is talking on the phone down at the police station: "I
keep telling you, lady, your husband and son have to be missing for a
week before we can start searching.  I'd like to help sooner, I would.
But we're very, very busy down here."  As he gets off the phone, he
sighs with relief, and tells his checkers opponent, a dog, to king him.}
Marge hangs up the phone worriedly, and Patty does nothing to reassure
her by telling her that it _is_ cougar season and that cougars don't
mess around.

Back at sea, a plane hovers near the raft.

 Bart: A rescue plane!  Get the flare gun!
        [Flanders does so, but Homer grabs it]
Homer: This ain't one of your church picnic flare-gun firings, Flanders!
       This is the real thing!
        [He discharges the gun, and the flare hits the plane and
       explodes]
       D'oh!
-- Homer, Church of Armaments member, 

Homer reasons they're still OK because the minute they rescue the pilot,
they'll also see the raft.  But a plane swoops by, just catching the
pilot before flying away.

{Three dolphins swim up to the raft, and Flanders is relieved.  "Here's
our chance: dolphins always help humans lost at sea!"  The dolphins
chatter at the humans, and a caption appears on the screen: "You're all
going to die."  They swim away, and Ned calls out to them, "Come back!
Come back!"  They ignore him, and Ned becomes frantic.}

     Ned: {Oh, we're done for, we're done for, we're done diddely done
          for, we're done diddely doodily, done diddely doodily, done
          diddely doodily, done diddely doodily --}
   Homer: {[grabs him and slaps him] Flanders!  Snap out of it!
          [slap!]}
     Ned: {Thank you, Homer...I don't know what got -- [slap! slap!
          slap!]}
    Bart: {[grabbing Homer's arm] Dad, I think he's OK --}
   Homer: {[slap! slap! slap slap!]  It's better [slap!] to be [slap!]
          safe [slap!] than [slap!] sorry!  [slap! slap! slap!]
           [apologizing] Sorry.}
Flanders: {Diddely -- [slap!]}
-- Violence solves everything, 

{Wiggum and Lou prepare a police boat for a search and rescue, but
Wiggum is reluctant to cast off before the mini-refrigerator is stocked
with beer and cold cuts.}

Homer pushes a cheese doodle onto a fishhook and Flanders points out
it's their last morsel.  Homer says, "You'll thank me when we're frying
up a big juicy fish."  He drops the hook into the water and holds the
reel of thread to which the hook is attached.  "Godspeed, little
doodle," sighs Neddy.  A fish bites right away, but Homer is too
complacent to do anything before the thread is all gone.  "He'll be
back," Homer thinks.  That night he calls lamely, "Here, fishy, fishy,
fishy.  We're waiting."

The next day the air is thick with fog.

 Homer: Son, there was something I was going to give you at the end of
        this trip, but since we may not survive, I want you to have it
        now.
  Bart: [gasps] A real Swiss Army knife!  Cool!
 Homer: I stole it from that Borgnine guy.
         [Scene switch to a ferocious bear]
Ernest: Don't worry, kids!  I'll take care of him with my trusty...
        [searches for his knife]...er, er, um, er, uh, hmm.
-- Who needed it more?, 

Dad, I know I've been a little hard on you the last couple of days.  If
I had the strength to lift my arms, I'd give you a hug.
-- Bart to Homer as they near death, 

Homer begins to warn Bart about the dangers of a knife on an inflated
raft, but he drops it.  All the blades are extended, but fortunately
none puncture the raft.  Just then the fog burns off and the sun comes
out.  Its rays are focused through the magnifying glass on the knife,
and it burns a hole through the rubber.  Homer watches dumbly, and Bart
says, "Dad, don't take this wrong, but your expression doesn't fill me
with confidence."

The foul stench of death is upon us!  [sniffs] Mmm, hamburgers.
-- Homer's famous nearly-last words, 

Bart sniffs and says, "Hey, wait, I smell hamburgers too!"  Flanders and
Todd sniff the air and they smell the same thing.

   Homer: According to this map, there's a Krusty Burger on an offshore
          oil rig.
Flanders: That's what you're smelling, Homer!  Oh, if it weren't for
          this blasted fog, we'd be saved.
   Homer: Never mind the fog!  [sniffs] That way!  Steer, there isn't
          much time!
-- The nose knows, 

Homer uses his super sense of smell to direct them.  On board the rig,
Krusty paces back and forth anxiously.

Krusty: Oh, I'm taking a bath on this.
   Man: We tried to tell you, these are _unmanned_ oil rigs.
Krusty: Aw, close the damn thing down.  No one's ever going to come.
 Homer: [runs in] Give me seven hundred Krusty burgers!
   Kid: You want fries with that?
-- Just in the nick of time, 

Bart tells Homer he's proud Homer's his father.  "Go away, eating!" says
Homer, stuffing his face.

Meanwhile, Ernest Borgnine and the other Junior Campers are settling in
around a fire.  "It sure is lucky we stumbled upon this old, abandoned
summer camp."  He suggests they all sing a song, and the boys agree.  He
grabs his guitar and they break into "Bingo the Dog."  From the trees
around the fire someone watches them.  As they sing the end of the
chorus, the figure darts out and grabs Ernest.  He screams.

[End of Act Three.  Time: 21:24]
 EPISODE TITLE: The Last Temptation of Homer


EPISODE SUMMARY: 
[Syndication cuts are marked in curly braces "{}" and are courtesy of
Ricardo Lafaurie and Michael Hendren.]

At school, Bart and Milhouse play a prank: they paint new dividing lines
in the parking lot.

    Bart: The beauty of it is, each parking space is a mere one foot
          narrower -- indistinguishable to the naked eye!  But therein
          lies the game.
Milhouse: I fear to watch, yet I cannot turn away.
-- Milhouse, Prince of Denmark, 

Watch, he does.  Principal Skinner pulls into an empty spot between two
cars, parks, and tries to open his door.

Skinner: Blast it, woman!  You parked too close.  Move your car!
   Edna: I'm in the lines!  You got a problem, go tell your Mama.
Skinner: Oh, don't worry: she'll hear about this.
-- Sparkling repartie in the school parking lot, "The Last Temptation of
    Homer"

Complete chaos ensues in the rest of the parking lot.  "I can't get
out!" one man yells.  "I'm trapped," observes Miss Hoover.  "I can't
breathe!" says another.  Bart laughs evilly at the success of his prank.

Eventually, in the grade four class, Mrs. Krabappel lectures them.

Edna: Class, I know there's no way to prove who actually did this, and
      in our American democracy, everyone is innocent until proven
      guilty.
Bart: God bless America.
Edna: But _my_ classroom is not a democracy.  Hah!  For the rest of the
      year, Bart Simpson will be the first student called on for _every_
      question.
-- Life in Springfield Socialist Elementary, "The Last Temptation of
    Homer"

"Well, let's get started," she finishes, turning to the board.  "Can
someone pronounce this word?" she queries, underlining "photosynthesis"
on the blackboard.  She looks around the class for a victim, ignoring
Martin (whose hand is raised) to ask Bart.  Bart hums and haws, and
Martin starts to make little grunting noises in desperation.  How he
would love to be called on!  "Oh, pick me, teacher: I'm ever so smart!"
he strains, while Bart continues to be perplexed.  Eventually Martin can
no longer hold back.  {Some of Bart's hesitations were cut in
syndication.}

Martin: It's "photosynthesis"!  [angrily] Damn your feeble brain.
  Bart: [plaintive] Oh, I couldn't read it.  The letters are all blurry.
  Edna: [mistrustful] Is it possible all your misbehavior and miserable
        grades have been caused by a simple vision disorder?
  Bart: [with a cockney accent] Ya mean it ain't me noggin, it's me
        peepers?  Well, that's just loverly.
-- Bart explained, 

At the nuclear plant, a man wearing an anti-contamination suit in a
sealed-off room handles nuclear waste.  Homer, Lenny, Carl, and Charlie
watch him.  "Watch this, guys," says Homer, manipulating a mechanical
arm so that it pinches the man's butt.  The man is startled, and he
drops the container of waste on the ground.  A greenish gas begins to
fill the room, and the man runs to the window, pleading with his eyes
for the observers to do something.  He pounds on the glass as he
collapses.

  Lenny: Uh oh...he's done for!
   Carl: Ehh, don't worry.  The safety glass will protect us.
          [Gas leaks through the glass]
  Lenny: Run!  We'll hide at my house.
          [They run towards the door but crash into the wall]
Charlie: Hey!  This emergency exit is painted on!
-- Proper safety measures, 

"There's no way out," Carl says frantically.  "We're doomed, we're
doomed!"  They huddle as the deadly green gas surrounds them.

In the next scene, Charlie is in Mr. Burns' office.

Charlie: Well, sir, I won't bore you with the details of our miraculous
         escape, but we desperately need a _real_ emergency exit!
  Burns: Why, that's a _fabulous_ idea!  Anything else you'd like?  How
         about real lead in the radiation shields?  Urinal cakes, maybe?
-- Is it an either/or?, 

Mr. Burns hands Smithers a pad and contemptuously tells him to throw it
at Charlie.  It smacks Charlie in the face.  Then, Mr. Burns pushes a
red button behind his desk.  A glass tube comes down from the ceiling
and covers the hapless Charlie, sucking upwards and out of sight.
"Smithers, where does that tube go?"  Monty asks idly.  Smithers doesn't
know; it was there when they moved in.

It would seem that the tube goes to India somewhere.  Charlie is
deposited, standing up, in the middle of a round table at which six men
are seated.  "Dance!  Dance!" they chant, and Charlie does so,
hesitantly.  The men start to cheer and ululate over the slow drum beat.

Back at the power plant, Smithers and Burns discuss what to do now.

Smithers: Sir, we'll need a new dangerous emissions supervisor.
   Burns: Yes, well find someone cheap!  It's been a very lean year for
          us...[glances at Smithers and smiles]
Together: Money fight!
           [They throw stacks of cash at one another, grunting and
          giggling]
-- Well, not _that_ lean, 

Smithers finds just the man for the job.  Mr. Burns stands over the new
man's shoulder, watching him work.

Zutroy: [reaches slowly for a button in front of him, then changes his
        mind at the last minute and pushes a different one]
 Burns: Excellent, Zutroy!  Work hard, and each day you'll get a shiny
        penny.
-- Hard work for fifty cents a year, 

Just then, a number of figures clad in black body-suits plunge through
the roof on ropes.

   Man: Agent Wesson, Department of Labor.  This man is an illegal
        alien!
 Burns: That's preposterous.  Zutroy here is as American as apple pie.
Zutroy: Tocnikrabda, mistah Boons.
-- English is his second language, 

Woman: This plant violates every labor law in the book.  We found a
       missing Brazilian soccer team working in your reactor core!
Burns: That plane crashed on _my_ property.
-- Inalienable right of ownership, 

  Man: Look, Mr. Burns: we want to see some changes.  For starters, you
       can reverse your sexist employment policies, and hire at least
       one woman.
Burns: All right...I'll bring in a woman.  But I still stand by my
       hiring policies.
        [A quacking duck in a hardhat pulls a wagon in]
       Get back to work, Stuart!
-- Sub-minimum wage, 

Marge has taken Bart to the "Hibbert Moneymaking Organization".  Dr.
Hibbert tells her he'll be able to provide every medical service they'll
ever need under one roof.  "You do have insurance, don't you?" he
checks, pressing a button.  A glass tube begins to slide down from the
roof over Marge's hair, and then it stops.  When Marge answers in the
affirmative, the tube slides back up.  Dr. Hibbert laughs and suggests
they go visit the optometrist.

Optometrist: Your son has a temporary condition called "Lazy Eye" where
             one eye is weaker than the other.  You'll have to wear
             these for two weeks.  [places horn-rimmed glasses on Bart]
       Bart: Ohh...
Optometrist: Menachem Begin wore a pair just like them!
-- Oh, well, that's OK then, 

The optometrist notices that Bart's scalp is a little dry, and he
recommends that Bart see the dermatologist.

Rub a palmful of this medicated salve into your scalp every half an
hour.  Keep him away from open flames and pregnant women.
-- The dermatologist deals with Bart's dry scalp, "The Last Temptation
    of Homer"

The orthopedic doctor fits Bart with a pair of clunky shoes to fix his
fallen arches.  Another doctor thinks Bart's throat is a little dry, and
she sprays it with something.  Bart coughs, and then says "Thanks, nice
lady.  My voice is crazy with this spraying already," sounding a good
deal like Jerry Lewis.  "Ay!  I feel so much better, Mr. Medical-
Science-Type-Person."

Lenny, Carl, and Homer have gotten word of Mr. Burns' new hiring
requirement.

Lenny: Aw, if they hire a woman we won't be able to spit on the floor.
 Carl: And we can't take off our pants when it gets real hot.
Homer: And we won't be able to pee in the drinking fountain...
        [Lenny and Carl look at each other suspiciously]
       Er, I mean, not...you know, if we wanted to...not that I...
       ever...did --
-- And you'll have to leave the seat down, "The Last Temptation of
    Homer"

Smithers walks in with an attractive woman in a hard hat.

Smithers: Gentlemen, I'd like you to meet your new co-worker, Mindy
          Simmons.  I think she has a degree in Engineering or
          something.
   Mindy: Hi...how's it going?
   Lenny: Oh, pleased to meet you.
    Carl: [bored] Yeah, ditto.
-- Carl, the life of the party, 

Homer greets her too, but all of a sudden he has a vision of Mindy,
naked, her private parts strategically covered, standing in a giant open
clam.  Sweet violin music swells in the background.  Miniature naked
Carl and Lenny cupids fly by.  "Homer, what's the matter?" asks cupid
Lenny.  "Ain't you ever seen a naked chick riding a clam before?" jeers
cupid Carl.  "Gotta go!"  Homer cries, running out a door and slamming
it.  "What the hell was that?" he asks.

I probably shouldn't have eaten that packet of powdered gravy I found in
the parking lot.
-- Homer tries to explain away a sexy vision, "The Last Temptation of
    Homer"

Bart goes back to school with his new glasses, slicked hair, and clunky
shoes.

Sherri+Terri: Nice glasses, four-eyes!  Tee hee hee.
      Nelson: Yeah, nice shoes, uh...two-feet.  Yeah.
      Martin: Your appearance is comical to me.
-- Bart walks into class with new glasses and shoes, "The Last
    Temptation of Homer"

Bart looks at Milhouse and sees his reflection in Milhouse's glasses.
"I'm a nerd!" he gasps.  "So am I!"  Milhouse gasps.

Homes leaves the nuclear plant at the end of the day.

Yep...another day, another box of stolen pens.
-- Homer leaves work for the day, 

"Have a good night, Homer!"  Mindy calls to him as she gets on her
motorcycle.  "You too," Homer calls belatedly as Mindy drives off.  He
gets in his car and surveys his senses: "No goosebumps, no
hallucinations; that last time was just a fluke," he sighs with relief.

He fails to notice that he's driving down the highway in reverse while
other cars swerve all around him and yell at him.  He whistles merrily
away until he backs over the curb and through a fence into a trout
hatchery.  He lands square in the center of a pool, submerging his car
half way.  A chorus line of trout appears and the wee fishies chant,
"Homer loves Mindy!  Homer loves Mindy!"  Cupid Carl appears and says
conspiratorially, "Hey Homer, you're hallucinating again."  Cupid Lenny
adds, "Not a good sign."

[End of Act One.  Time: 6:21]

Homer chats with Carl and Lenny the next day at work.

Homer: [hesitant] So...what do you guys think of Mindy?
 Carl: Seems OK.  Anybody see the game last night?
Homer: [dreamy] Yeah...that Mindy seems real nice.
Lenny: Homer, what's with you?  You're talking during a coffee break.
 Carl: Yeah.  You usually just take the box of donuts into the bathroom.
Homer: [pause] Mindy has a motorcycle.
-- Ah, middle-aged love, 

Bart, meanwhile, tries to prove to everyone that his appearance hasn't
changed the rest of him.  He grabs his skateboard, but the heavy shoes
make him clumsy, and after a short ride down the hallway, he smashes
into a locker and lands with a calculus text open over his face.  "Hey!"
Jimbo threatens, "he's learning on his own!"  He, Dolph, and Kearney
pound the hapless nerd into the ground.

At Moe's tavern, Homer turns to Moe for advice.

 Homer: Moe, I need your advice.
   Moe: [bored] Yeah.
 Homer: See, I got this friend named...Joey Jo-Jo...Junior...Shabadoo --
   Moe: That's the worst name I ever heard.
         [A man leaves, weeping]
Barney: Hey, Joey Jo-Jo!
-- You'd think he'd be used to that by now, "The Last Temptation of
    Homer"

Homer sees little point in keeping up the charade.

 Homer: I'm attracted to another woman!  What am I going to do?
Barney: Your infatuation is based on a physical attraction.  Talk to the
        woman, and you'll realize you have nothing in common.
 Homer: [amazed] Barney, that is so insightful.  How did you come up
        with that?
Barney: It was on one of these bar napkins.
-- You can read?, 

At Barney's suggestion, Homer goes looking for Mindy; he finds her
eating donuts at her station.  He taps his fingers nervously together in
the doorway before speaking.

Homer: [awkwardly] Uh...so, let's have a conversation.  Um...I think
       we'll find we have very little in common.
Mindy: Can't talk -- eating.
Homer: [gasps] Hey, my favorite -- raspberry swirl with a double glaze.
Mindy: [drooling] Double glaze...
Homer: [whimpers] D'oh!  OK, so we have one thing in common.  But you
       know what I hate?  [craftily] Drinking beer and watching TV...
Mindy: [blissful] Oh, not me.  That's my idea of heaven.
Homer: [weakly] D'oh!  Me too.
Mindy: Really?  I can see I'm gonna love working with you.  Well, gotta
       go.  [whispers] I wanna sneak in a quick nap before lunch.
        [She walks off, and Homer can barely contain himself]
Homer: Foul temptress.  I'll bet she thinks Ziggy's gotten too preachy
       too!
-- Commonality of deadly sins, 

Homer approaches an elevator somewhere in the plant and pushes the down
button.

Homer: Whew!  I made it the whole day without seeing her again.
        [The elevator arrives and Homer gets in.  The door closes and he
       notices he's crammed in with Mindy]
       Aah!  I mean, hello!
Mindy: [awkward] Heh...I guess we'll be going down together -- I mean,
       getting off togeth -- I mean --
Homer: That's OK.  I'll just push the button for the stimulator -- I
       mean, elevator.
-- Blast that infernal double entendre, 

Homer closes his eyes and chants unhappily, "Think unsexy thoughts,
think unsexy thoughts..." He imagines Patty and Selma in the bathroom
together, shaving their legs.  "Ohh, that's unsexy," he shudders.  He
then pictures Barney in a bikini: "Eww!"  Barney is singing the theme
from "I Dream of Jeanie" seductively, but he's interrupted when he
burps.

But Homer's vision then turns sexy; Barney becomes Mindy in a red bikini
and she blows him a kiss.  He snaps out of his reverie to see that
Mindy, too, is whispering "Think unsexy thoughts!  Think unsexy
thoughts!"  Homer can't take it any more, and he says, "Well, this is my
stop!"  He presses the "Stop" button in the elevator, forces the door
open, and steps out -- into the air.  As he slides down the cooling
tower, he calls back, "See you tomorrow!"

Homer: Ah, home to my loving family.  What more could a man ask for?
        [Marge appears in her nightie, blowing her nose]
Marge: Hi Hober.  Don't kiss be, I'b all stuffed ub.
Homer: Eww!
 Bart: Hi Dad.
Homer: Hi, son!  How ya -- [pats Bart's goop-slicked hair] Eww!
 Lisa: Dad, look: I made fishsticks.  They're burned on the outside but
       they're frozen on the inside so it balances out.
Homer: Yeah...good.
  Abe: [chasing SLH] That raccoon stole my lamb chop!
-- What more, indeed?, 

Homer sits with Marge on the couch.  "Let's have a little quality time
together, just you and me," he says.  Marge thinks that's sweet, and she
shows Homer a T-shirt she got made at the mall with her photo on it.
Except they smeared it, so she got two dollars off.  The T-shirt makes
her look grotesque.

Homer: Hey, we haven't watched TV in a while!  [turns it on]
 Kent: Tonight, "Eye On Springfield" takes a look at the secret affairs
       of Kennedy, Eisenhower, Bush, and Clinton.  Did fooling around on
       their wives make them great?  We'll find out next, when we play
       "Hail to the Cheat."
Homer: [whimpers, changes channels]
  Man: {The Burmese Melon Fly has over a thousand sex partners, and
       suffers virtually no guilt --}
Homer: {[whimpers, changes channels]
        [A bunch of scantily clad women work out on weight machines]}
Woman: [seductive] Just do it!
Homer: Aah!  [runs out]
Woman: {[seductive] Examine your scalp for ringworm.  [Caption:
       "National Ringworm Association (The Other N.R.A.)"]}
-- Homer tries to avoid thinking about Mindy, "The Last Temptation of
    Homer"

In desperation, Homer calls a marriage counseling hotline.

Homer: Hello, hotline?  I'm very tempted by another woman.
  Ned: Homer Simpson?  That's a dilly of a pickle.  Let's conference you
       with Marge, huh?
-- So much for anonymity, 

Homer yells and tries to get away, but he just knocks the phone booth on
its side.  The fall stuns him, and his spirit is pulled from his body by
another spirit.

 Homer: Who are you?
Newton: Homer, I'm your guardian angel.  I've assumed the form of
        someone you'd recognize and revere: Sir Isaac Newton.
 Homer: Sir Isa-who?
Newton: Oh, very well.  [transforms himself]
 Homer: [gasps] Colonel Klink!  Did you ever get my letters?
 Klink: I'm not actually Colonel Klink, I'm just assuming his form.
 Homer: Hee hee hee!  Did you know Hogan had tunnels all over your camp?
-- The chance of a lifetime, 

Klink says that he's not there to discuss the show.

 Klink: My job is to show you how miserable life would be if you married
        Mindy instead of Marge.
         [He takes Homer's hand, and they fly into the air]
 Homer: Ooh!  I would live in a big mansion?
         [Homer and Mindy play tennis while Jeeves looks on]
 Mindy: I'm so happy, darling.
 Homer: I, as well.  Are you happy, Jeeves?
Jeeves: M'yes sir, quite.
 Homer: Then we're all happy!
 Klink: Let's get out of here...
-- Spirit Homer is shown the problem with cheating, "The Last Temptation
    of Homer"

Klink: Sure, life is good for you.  But what about Marge?
        [They fly over the White House]
Homer: [gasps] Marge lives here?
  Man: Madam President, your approval rating is soaring.
Marge: Hmm...
-- Alternate destinies shown to Spirit Homer, "The Last Temptation of
    Homer"

"This dream is over," Klink warns, and Homer is dropped back into his
body in the phone booth.  He struggles to free himself, and Lionel Hutz
walks up to the tipped booth and says indignantly, "Hey, you!  Get out
of my office!"

Meanwhile, at school, the bullies taunt Bart.  A hick boy dressed in
overalls with a straw hat and a piece of wheat is his teeth comments,
"Yer goofy-lookin', hyuck, hyuck," and the bullies beat Bart up.  Bart
manages to escape out of their ring, and he runs away frantically.  An
arm reaches from a locker and pulls him inside.  Martin lights a match
and Bart says in wonderment, "What the hell?"  Martin shushes him and
leads him to a room full of nerds.  Some play chess, some write on
blackboards or on walls, an another builds a model of the Enterprise.

    Bart: What is this place?
  Nerd 1: The refuge of the damned.
  Martin: [gleeful] A place where we can work on our extra-credit
          assignments without fear of reprisal.
  Nerd 2: Come!  You must be tired from the chase.  Oliver!  [claps]
          Bring our friend a hard-boiled egg and some prune juice.
  Martin: Finally, Bart's one of us!
Everyone: Excelsior!
-- Bart joins the nerd club, 

Homer prepares himself in the bathroom for a day at work, spraying
deodorant on his body and singing.

Homer: [singing]
       Oh Mindy, you came and you gave without flaking,
       But I sent you Ben Gay.
       Oh Andy, you kissed me and stopped me from something,
       And I -- [sees Lisa watching] Uh oh.
 Lisa: Dad, why are you singing?
Homer: [thinking] Tell a lie, tell a lie.
        [spoken] Um, because I have a small role in a broadway musical.
       It's not much, but it's a start.
        [thinking] Bravo.  [sarcastic clapping]
-- Homer under pressure, 

 Lisa: Are you hiding something from me?
Homer: Like what?
 Lisa: Judging from your song, you're infatuated with a woman named
       Mindy.  [despondent] Or a man named Andy.
Homer: [making things up] Lisa, look out behind you!
 Lisa: [jovial] Dad, I'm not gonna fall for that.
Homer: No, Lisa, I swear to you: I'm 100% completely serious!  You've
       got to turn around right now before it's too late!
 Lisa: [turns] Huh?
Homer: [running away] Sucker!
-- No trick too childish, 

Homer decides to tell Mindy in no uncertain terms that they should avoid
each other.

Homer: [reads writing on his palm] "Mindy, because of our uncontrollable
       attraction, I think we should avoid each other from now on."
Lenny: [reads writing on his own palm] "Max, what I did, I did because
       of alcohol and anger."
Man 2: [reads writing on his own large palm] "I am tired of these jokes
       about my giant hand.  The first such incidents occurred in 1956
       when..."
-- Useful memory aids, 

Mindy: Hi Homer...
Homer: Mindy!  [clears throat, glances at prepared speech on his hand
       which is now smeared]
       Oh no, I'm sweating like Roger Ebert.
        [reads] "Muh...Murphy: Use...you are a elf...uncontrollably...I
       think ...a we nom yo ho renge kyo."
-- Homer the inadvertent Buddhist, 

Mr. Burns watches the two of them on a monitor.

          [Homer talks to Mindy on a monitor]
   Burns: Look at those two inseparable chums, Smithers.  That's exactly
          the teamwork we'd like to showcase at this year's energy
          convention.
Smithers: Are you sure?
   Burns: Well, no one else seems to share the same spirit of...
          camaraderie.
           [Monitor one shows people fighting with chairs]
           [Monitor two shows people strangling each other]
           [Monitor three shows a dead man with Stuart the duck pecking
          his eye]
-- Serious communication problems, 

Smithers: Simpson, Simmons: you two have been chosen to represent us at
          the national energy convention.  Congratulations!  You'll be
          spending two nights together in glamorous Capital City.
   Mindy: Wow, Capital City!  The Windy Apple!
Smithers: Come on, I'll get you the tickets.
   Homer: Oh, this is the worst crisis my marriage has ever faced!
          Colonel Klink, why have you forsaken me?
           [Klink materializes]
   Klink: What is it?  You have a question?
   Homer: Heh heh.  Did you know Kinch had a radio in the coffee pot?
   Klink: [suspicious] He did?
-- 

[End of Act Two.  Time: 14:49]

It's convention day!  Homer is shown his glamorous hotel room number 61
at the Capital City Plaza Hotel ("Legionnaires' Disease-Free since
1990") by a bellhop.

Bellhop: TV's there...bathroom's there...and there's your king-size bed
         for...[wolf-whistles, makes a cat noise, imitates a bed
         squeaking, purrs, pants, barks, howls, twiddles his lips] Hubba
         hubba!
  Homer: Stop that!  I love my wife and family.  All I'm gonna use this
         bed for is sleeping, eating, and maybe building a little fort.
-- The best of intentions, 

Homer glances in the bathroom and is delighted to see they give him
complimentary mouthwash and shampoo.  "Free shower curtain!" he cries,
ripping it from its holders.  Across the hall, Mindy says and does the
same thing.

Mindy: Wow.  If it weren't for this wall, we'd be sleeping in the same
       bed.
Homer: Yeah.  Uh, walls are a necessity in today's society, heh.
-- Homer waxes philosophical, 

Mindy: Homer?  [whispers] I got a really wicked idea that could get us
       into a _lot_ of trouble.
Homer: Oh, Mindy...we have to fight our temptation.
Mindy: [seductive] No, Homer, let's do it.  [joyous] Let's call room
       service!
Homer: Oh...
-- Not what he had in mind, 

          {[a buzzer sounds in Mr. Burns' office]}
Smithers: {Someone is charging room service to the company, sir.}
   Burns: {Well, we'll just see about that.
           [Walks over to a cage full of monkeys with wings]
          Fly, my pretties, fly!
           [They walk to the window and plummet to their deaths]
           [sighs] Continue the research.}
-- Genetic engineering at SNPP, 

Homer and Mindy sit on Homer's bed and gorge themselves, empty dishes
scattered about.

          [Grunting and slurping noises]
   Mindy: [mouth full] I can't believe we ordered so much!
   Homer: Oh, something's missing...ooh!  One of the turkeys fell behind
          the bed!
Together: Mmm...foot-long chili dog.
-- A match made in heaven, 

The two begin eating the chili dog, one from each end.  Their lips meet
in the middle, and they stare at one another in surprise.  Homer pulls
away, and all the buttons on his shirt pop open, revealing the Marge T-
shirt.  Suddenly the air is filled with the noise of Marge saying "Mmm."
Homer panics and thinks it's a omen, and he runs out, but the noise was
actually coming from a floor waxer.

Marge: Good news, honey: two weeks are up.  You don't have to wear your
       glasses any more!  And your scalp and posture seem fine.
 Bart: [triumphant] Yes!  [kicks shoes off]
       {[They fly through the air and smash through Flanders' window]}
  Ned: {Kids, did anyone pray for giant shoes?}
  Rod: {I did!}
  Ned: {Okily dokily.}
-- The Lord giveth..., 

At school, Nelson makes a suggestion to his fellow bullies.

We've been doing a lot of upper body work on Bart.  Today, let's pound
his kidneys.
-- Nelson's bullying acumen, 

Bart strolls in, humming.  "Let's get -- huh?"  He looks normal!  "What
gives?" asks Jimbo.  "Gentlemen," Bart begins, "the nerd you knew is
dead.  Beat me and you will be beating one of your own."  The bullies
pause for a minute, then Nelson says, "Whatever," and they beat him
anyway.

The "Welcome National Energy Convention" sign flashes briefly, but then
burns out.  {The camera pans past all the exhibits at the energy
convention inside the convention center: cold fusion, "Oil Power", "What
About Wind?", coal, and water.  It comes to rest on the solar energy
display ("Cheap, clean hope for tomorrow"), which is being run by Hans
Moleman.  A man in a suit with sunglasses asks, "So this stuff really
works?"  "It certainly does," says Hans proudly.  "Oh, well, lotsa
luck!" says the man, giving Hans a chop in the neck.  A number of other
men in suits appear, and two of them close red curtains around the
exhibit.  When they open them again, one man sits behind the desk in
front of a banner that says, "Fossil Fuel: Use Us and Nobody Gets
Hurt."}

Homer and Mindy sit at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant booth.
Behind them, the booth's display proudly advertises, "As Seen on 60
Minutes".  Mindy files her nails.

Man 1: Thanks for poisoning the planet, bastard!
Mindy: Get bent!
Man 2: No more Chernobyl!
Homer: Go to hell!
-- Homer and Mindy run the Nuclear Energy display, "The Last Temptation
    of Homer"

Homer tosses a brick at him (which he had ready, as though he was
expecting trouble), and chuckles.

Homer: You know, I was a little worried about coming to this convention
       with you.  But I think as long as we're not alone together --
  Man: [over loudspeaker] And now, the moment you've been waiting for.
       This years King and Queen of Energy are Homer Simpson and Mindy
       Simmons!
Homer: Huh?
        [Everyone applauds as the two are given crowns]
  Man: Homer, Mindy, you've just won a romantic dinner alone at Madam
       Chao's, the sexiest Chinese restaurant in Capital City.
Homer: Is there any way to get out of this?
  Man: [stern] No!
-- Accolades fit for a resume', 

Homer and Mindy finish their sexy dinner at Madam Chao's.

Mindy: [sighs] What a perfect evening.  It sure was nice of them to make
       us cheeseburgers.
Homer: Uh, yeah.
-- At a Chinese restaurant, 

Homer opens his fortune cookie and reads his fortune.

Homer: [reading his fortune] "You will find happiness with a new love."
       [out loud] Aw, even the Chinese are against me.  [sigh] What's
       the point?  I can't fight fate.
        [In the kitchen...]
Man 1: Hey, we're out of these "New Love" cookies.
Man 2: Well, open up the "Stick With Your Wife" barrel.
-- Controversial fortune cookies, 

Back at their hotel...

Homer: [unhappy] Well, I guess you'll want to come in.
Mindy: [bright] OK.
Homer: [mocking] "OK!"
        [They sit on the bed]
Mindy: This was a really nice night, Homer.
Homer: Yeah, yeah.
-- Homer, appreciative date, 

He begins sobbing.

Mindy: What's wrong?
Homer: Oh, yeah, like you don't know.  [weeping] We're gonna have sex!
Mindy: Oh...well, we don't have to.
Homer: [sad] Yes we do!  The cookie told me so.
Mindy: Well...desserts aren't always right.
Homer: But they're so sweet!
-- Homer and Mindy alone in the hotel, 

Mindy tries to reassure him.

Mindy: Homer...you don't have to do anything you don't want to.
Homer: Well, maybe I want to...but then I think about Marge and the
       kids...well, not the boy: he drives me nuts.  Sometimes I'd just
       like to --
-- Wandering train of thought, 

Mindy says that Homer knows how she feels, and she tells him it's up to
him.  "Look in your heart; I think you'll see what you want."  Their
heads move slowly closer as though they're about to kiss passionately,
but instead they kiss briefly.  Homer makes up his mind and soon he is
drooling over shapely, female flesh as Barry Whites "Can't Get Enough of
Your Love" plays in the background.

Homer: Oh, baby.
Marge: This was a _wonderful_ idea, Homey.  [kisses him] Hey, there's a
       turkey behind the bed!
Homer: Mmm, Marge.
Marge: [laughs girlishly, turns out the light]
Homer: [sings]
       Oh Margie, you came and you found me a turkey
       On my vacation away from worky...
-- Homer, incurable romantic, 

In the dark, another pair of eyes appear.  The owner of the eyes wolf-
whistles, makes a cat noise, imitates a bed squeaking, purrs, pants,
barks, howls, twiddles his lips, and says, "Hubba, hubba!"  Homer
punches him in one eye.

 EPISODE TITLE: $pringfield


EPISODE SUMMARY: 
[Syndication cuts are marked in curly braces "{}" and are courtesy of
Ricardo Lafaurie and Frederic Briere.]

An old newsreel film is shown.

The News On Parade Corporation presents "News On Parade Corporation
News".
-- A newsreel's introduction, "$pringfield"

The narrator continues: "Bringing you the world of current events," as
an atomic bomb explodes in the background and a smiling soldier in the
foreground collapses, "new gadgets," showing a family watching a train
approach them on a small television; they raise their hands in fright
when the train reaches the camera, "and Hollywood. look: it's Amos from
radio's 'Amos and Andy'!" the narrator says, and Amos greets us: "Hello,
everybody!"

Springfield: City On the Grow.  It's a proud day as Springfield is
declared one of America's four hundred fastest-growing cities.
And why not?  Business is booming!  Half the country wears Springfield
galoshes.  And say hello to the state's first Aqua-Car factory.  Keep
'em coming, boys!
The city's even in the celebrity business.  Everyone knows Professor
Rubbermouth hails from Springfield.
Everybody's chipping in; even this fellow [a dog with pulling a wagon
with a sign, "I'll pull for Springfield"] has Springfield's can-do
spirit.
So watch out, Utica: Springfield is a City On the...Grow!
-- Shameless newsreel tourism plugs, "$pringfield"

The newsreel ends, and a young Abe and Jasper walk out of the theater.

   Abe: Hah!  The way people act around here, you'd think the streets
        were paved with gold.
Jasper: They are.
-- Logical conclusions, "$pringfield"

As if to prove Jasper's point, a car tries unsuccessfully to brake, but
the shiny street surface is too slippery.

1993 fades in and Abe and Jasper age forty years in a blink.  The
formerly tranquil background is polluted with gunfire and a siren.  The
two old men encounter a street bum.

Bum: Got any spare change, man?
Abe: Yes!  And you ain't gettin' it.  Everybody wants something for
     nothing.
      [Abe walks into the social security building] I'm old: gimme gimme
     gimme!
-- Everybody indeed, "$pringfield"

At the power plant, Homer is in the bathroom, humming.

Hey!  _There's_ something you don't see in a toilet every day.
-- Homer at the power plant, "$pringfield"

It's a pair of horn-rimmed glasses.

Homer: Anyone lose their glasses?  [no one answers]
       Last chance!  [still no one answers]
       Woo-hoo!
        [Homer fishes the glasses out of the toilet.  He puts them on]
       The sum of the square roots of any two sides of an isosceles
       triangle is equal to the square root of the remaining side.
  Man: That's a _right_ triangle, you idiot!
Homer: D'oh!
-- Reverting to Homercles the Greek, "$pringfield"

Mr. Burns says farewell to a distinguished guest.

   Burns: Thank you so much for visiting our plant, Dr. Kissinger.
   Henry: It was fun.
Smithers: We'll let you know if your glasses turn up.
   Henry: Er, yes, well, I'm sure I left them in the car.  [sotto voce]
          No one must know I dropped them in the toilet; not I, the man
          who drafted the Paris Peace Accord.
-- Material for the National Enquirer, "$pringfield"

Burns and Smithers grunt awkwardly for a few seconds, eventually closing
the door on Dr. Kissinger.

Smithers: Sir, bad news from accounting: the economy's hit us pretty
          hard.
   Burns: Heh, tough times, huh?  I've lived through twelve recessions,
          eight panics, and five years of McKinleynomics.  I'll survive
          this.
Smithers: Even so, sir, we _could_ stand to lay off a few employees.
   Burns: [enthusiastic] Oh, very well!  [points at some monitors] Lay
          off him, him, him, him --
           [sees Homer wearing Kissinger's glasses]
          Hmm...better keep the egghead.  He just might come in handy.
-- An effective disguise, "$pringfield"

Lisa tries to dissuade Homer.

 Lisa: Dad, you shouldn't wear glasses that weren't prescribed for you.
Homer: [to Bart] Lisa, just because you're ten feet tall doesn't mean
       you can tell me what to do.
 Bart: I'm Bart.
 Lisa: [snatching them] Gimme those!
Scott: And finally, Henry Kissinger was hospitalized today after walking
       into a wall.
-- Cause and effect, "$pringfield"

 Scott: And now over to Kent Brockman for some grim economic news.
  Kent: Scott, things aren't as happy as they used to be down here at
        the unemployment office.  Joblessness is no longer just for
        philosophy majors.  _Useful_ people are starting to feel the
        pinch.
Barney: I haven't been able to find a job in six years.
  Kent: Hmph.  And what training do you have?
Barney: Five years of modern dance, six years of tap.
-- Have you considered Broadway?, "$pringfield"

The economic slump began last spring when the government closed Fort
Springfield, devastating the city's liquor and prostitution industries.
 [Shot shows prostitutes holding signs]
Now, at the risk of being unpopular, this reporter places the blame
squarely on you, the viewers!
-- Kent Brockman editorializes, "$pringfield"

A town meeting is held to decide how to handle the economic slump.

  Quimby: I propose that I use what's left of the town treasury to move
          to a more prosperous town and run for mayor.  And, er, once
          elected, I will send for the rest of you.
Audience: Boo!
    Lisa: Excuse me, Mr. Mayor --
  Quimby: The chair recognizes the little chick with the gleam of hope
          in her eyes.
    Lisa: This piggy bank contains fifteen dollars I've saved from my
          allowance.  It isn't much, but I would like to help.
  Quimby: Aw, just what I need to tip the skycaps.
-- The Mayor distinguishes himself, "$pringfield"

I'll tell you what made this town great!  Good old-fashioned gumption.
there's nothing here a little elbow-grease won't fix.  So let's roll up
our sleeves and -- [falls asleep standing up]
-- Abe's pep rally, ruined by narcolepsy, "$pringfield"

Mayor Quimby doesn't agree.

 Quimby: People, people: let's be a little more realistic.
Skinner: Now, I, uh, hesitate to bring this up, but a number of cities
         have rejuvenated their economies with, er, legalized gambling.
          [Everyone talks excitedly]
         There _is_ an added bonus: some of the revenue can go to help
         our underfunded public schools.
          [Everyone stares stonily]
  Patty: {Well, I liked the part about the gambling.}
-- Principal Skinner: one for two, "$pringfield"

Just to make sure it's OK with God, Ned checks with Rev. Lovejoy.

     Ned: What do you think, reverend?
 Lovejoy: Once something has been approved by the government, it's no
          longer immoral.
Audience: Yay!
   Burns: By building a casino, I could tighten my stranglehold on this
          dismal town!
Audience: Yay!
  Barney: {[burps]}
Audience: {Yay!}
-- No one fickle here, "$pringfield"

Quimby bangs his gavel to restore order.

  Quimby: Well now, are there any objections?
           [Everyone grumbles, "Marge Simpson..."]
   Marge: Actually, I think it might really help our economy.
           [Everyone sounds surprised]
  Quimby: Very well, then: instead of fleeing this town, I'll sit back
          and grow fat off kickbacks and slush funds.
Audience: Yay!
-- And everyone is happy!, "$pringfield"

The audience departs, cheering.

Marge: This could be a whole new beginning for Springfield.
Homer: And you know what the best part is?  We've really done something
       for the children.
-- Advantages of legalized gambling, "$pringfield"

[End of Act One.  Time: 5:27]

Mayor Quimby takes Mr. Burns for a stroll along the prospective site for
the new casino.

 Quimby: We're thrilled you've decided to build your casino on our
         waterfront.
  Burns: Oh, I'll never forget my carefree boyhood days on this old
         boardwalk.
          [flashback to Mr. Burns driving a bumper car -- straight into
         the legs of a workman]
Workman: Why you -- oh!  Master Burns.  I mean, carry on!
          [Young Burns smashes him repeatedly] Ah!  Oh!  Ow!  Oh, me
         leg's gone gimpy.  Who will provide for me little ones?
-- Burns the sadist, "$pringfield"

Young Burns laughs evilly, and old Burns laughs as he remembers.  His
laughter continues in the shower later that day, in bed that night, in
church on Sunday, and at his desk on Monday as he pounds his desk in
merriment.  "What was I laughing at now?...Oh yes, that crippled
Irishman!"  He breaks into hysterical mirth again.

  Smithers: Sir, the designers are here with some prototypes for your
            casino.
      Brit: Gentlemen, I give you Brittania!  Gambling with all the
            glitz and glamour of the British Isles.  Best of all, the
            waitresses and showgirls are all real Brits -- fresh from
            the streets of Sussex, they are.
     Woman: Freshen your drink, Guv'ner?
     Burns: Get out.
     Hippy: OK, all right, wait, now -- now dig this, man --
     Burns: Get out.
     Hippy: Ho ho, wow, oh, let me just get my head together.
     Burns: Now!
McAllister: I'll need three ships and fifty stout men.  We'll sail
            'round the Horn and return with spices and silk, the likes
            of which ye have never seen.
     Burns: We're building a casino!
McAllister: Arr...can you give me five minutes?
-- One bad design after another, "$pringfield"

Mr. Burns is unimpressed.  "Idiots.  I'll design it myself!  I know what
people like: it's got to have sex appeal and a catchy name."  He calls
it "Mr. Burns' Casino", and makes a giant mermaid statue of himself in
the center of a fountain.

Lisa talks to Marge at home.

 Lisa: Mom, we're having a geography pageant at school, and I don't know
       which state to go as.
Marge: In honor of legalized gambling, why not go as the state of
       Nevada?
 Lisa: No: Nevada makes my butt look big.
-- Texas would be worse, "$pringfield"

Marge: Then how about going as Florida?  You enjoy orange juice, old
       people like you --
 Lisa: Dad, what do _you_ think?
Homer: Shh!  I'm trying to teach the baby to gamble.
Marge: Why?
Homer: I got a job at Burns' casino.  As you know, it's been my lifelong
       dream to become a blackjack dealer.
Marge: Your lifelong dream was to be a contestant on "The Gong Show",
       and you did it in 1977, remember?
        [Flashback to Homer and Barney playing a giant harmonica,
       wearing a pair of two-man large overalls, getting gonged and
       booed]
Homer: We got more gongs than the break-dancing robot that caught on
       fire.
-- Something to be proud of, "$pringfield"

At Burns' casino, Otto meets the official greeter.

Gerry: Hello.  I'm retired heavyweight boxer Gerry Cooney.  Welcome to
       Mr. Burns' Casino!  If there's anything I can do to make your
       visit more enjoyable, please: just let me know.
 Otto: Er, great.  See ya!
Gerry: Uh, don't forget to apply for our V.I.P.  Platinum Club for
       special discounts on --
 Otto: Hey!  I said, bug off!
        [Otto punches him in the jaw, and he collapses]
-- That glass jaw again, "$pringfield"

Homer works at his job with vim and vigor.

   Homer: Uh, let's see: eighteen, twenty-seven, thirty-five...Dealer
          busts!  Looks like you all win again.
   Texan: Yee-haw!  Homer, I want you to have my lucky hat.  I wore it
          the day Kennedy was shot, and it always brings me good luck.
   Homer: Why thanks, Senator!  Oh -- looks like my shift is over.
Everyone: Uh oh.  [they all leave]
-- Taking a break, gentlemen?, "$pringfield"

{Abe prepares to roll the dice at the craps table.}

Abe: {Come on, lucky seven!  Poppa needs a new pair of spats.  I want
     some of that sweet, sweet Do Re Mi.  Fat city, here I come!}
Apu: {Please throw the dice now, please, now.}
Abe: {Don't rush me!  I have arthritis.}
Man: {Would the gentleman please roll the dice?}
Abe: {All right, all right, smart guy.  Oh, for crying out loud, I
     dropped one.  Oh, now it's in my shoe.  Ow!  Ooh!  Ow!  Ooh!...}
-- No free drinks for _him_, "$pringfield"

Inside one of the showrooms, Gunter and Ernst demonstrate their talented
albino tiger riding a unicycle.  "A round of applause, please, for
Anastasia.  She loves show-business.  So much nicer than the savagery of
the jungle, ja?"  In a flashback, we see Anastasia sleeping peacefully
in Africa.  Behind her two men approach in a jeep.  "Hey, tiger!" one of
them calls out, "Wake up!"  He shoots a tranquilizer dart into her, and
she slumps over.  The memory angers her sufficiently to attack her
owners and tear them to shreds.

Bart plays a slot machine with a quarter he finds.

Bart: Woo-hoo!  Jackpot.
 Kid: Wait a minute: are you over 21?
Bart: Are you?
 Kid: I'm not authorized to answer that.
-- Crafty questioning, "$pringfield"

But Bart is tossed into the street nonetheless.

Bart: By the way, your martinis suck!
 Kid: Oh yeah?  What are you going to do?  Start your own casino in your
      treehouse and get all your little friends to come?  I'd like to
      see that.  Ah ha ha ha...
       [Kids pile into Bart's new casino in his treehouse]
Bart: Hi, yeah, welcome.  Have a lucky day.  Mm hmm.
 Kid: Well, he certainly showed me.
-- Retributive justice at its finest, "$pringfield"

[3F31 revealed a new cut scene.  Transcript courtesy of Frederic
Briere.]

Blofeld: 20.  Your move, Mr. Bond.
   Bond: I'll take a hit, dealer.  [Homer gives him a card] Joker!  You
         were supposed to take those out of the deck.
  Homer: Oh, sorry.  Here's another one.
   Bond: What's this card?  "Rules for Draw and Stud Poker"?
Blofeld: What a pity, Mr. Bond.
          [Odd Job and Jaws grab Bond and drag him out]
   Bond: But...but it's Homer's fault!  I didn't lose.  I never lose!
         Well, at least tell me the details of your plot for world
         domination.
Blofeld: Ho ho ho, I'm not going to fall for _that_ one again.
          [as they all leave, Marge comes in, holding Maggie]
-- "$pringfield"

[End of cut scene.]

Marge greets Homer at the blackjack table.

Marge: Hi Homey.
Homer: Hey Marge, after your big tantrum against legalized gambling, I
       bet it feels pretty weird to be in a casino.
Marge: I was for the casino.
Homer: Strike three, Marge!  I remember that meeting and I have a
       photographic memory.
        [In Homer's memory, Marge wears a blue dress and has green hair.
       She holds a rolling pin.  Homer's arms are massive]
Marge: Legalized gambling is a bad idea.  You can build a casino over my
       dead body.  Blah blah blah blah blah.  Blah blah blah, blah blah
       blah blah blah.
  Man: For you: it's the President.  [tentacle hands Homer a phone]
Homer: Y'ello?
        [back to reality] And then I said to the President -- get this
       -- Marge?  Marge?
-- No captive audience, "$pringfield"

As Marge walks away from Homer, she notices a shiny 1992 quarter on the
red carpet.  "I wonder if they have a Lost and Found?" she asks, but she
notices the "25 cent" sign above a nearby slot machine.  "Oh, what the
hey," she reasons, and puts the coin in.

The wheels stop spinning, and a short snatch of victory music sounds.
Four quarters drop into the tray, and Marge seems impressed.  She walks
out the sliding doors of the casino, but looking at her watch, she
decides she has time for a couple more turns on the slot machine.

Bart's casino is doing well.  A lighted sign announces, "Tonight:
Milhouse.  Next week: an evening with Jimbo."  Inside, under the odds
board, children swarm around the buffet.  Jimbo uses a rake as a
croupier stick at the craps table.

Hey, how's it going?  Hey: good to see you.  Hey, friends: looking
lucky.  Hey, what's happenin'?  Love the jacket.
-- Bart the Emcee at his own casino, "$pringfield"

Milhouse's act involves Snowball II and "The Box of Mystery."  He says,
"The cat goes in --" but the poor animal seems reluctant to comply.
Milhouse tries to force her, but this only aggravates her more.  She
knocks his top hat off to reveal another similar-looking cat underneath
it, and the two cats wreak havoc with their claws on Milhouse's face
while the audience applauds.

{Back in Burns' Casino, Homer watches a Dustin Hoffman-lookalike with
amazement while a Tom Cruise-lookalike sits next to him.}

  Homer: {Twenty-one?  Do that card counting thing again.  Come on: do
         it again.}
Raymond: {Definitely have to leave the table.}
  Homer: {No!  Please, please, please, please, please?}
Raymond: {Gotta watch Wapner.  Leave the table.  Yeah, leave the table.}
  Homer: {No!  [grabs his arm]}
Raymond: {Aah!  [screams repeatedly, hits his head with his palm]}
  Homer: {Aah!  [screams repeatedly, hits his head with his palm]}
-- Autism is contagious, "$pringfield"

From the control room, Smithers and Burns watch the patrons gamble.
Burns' hair is longer and he has some stubble.

Smithers: Sir, you haven't slept since the casino opened five days ago.
   Burns: Yeah, well, I've discovered the perfect business: people swarm
          in, empty their pockets, and scuttle off.  Nothing can stop me
          now -- [paranoid] except microscopic germs.  But we won't let
          that happen, will we, Smithers?
Smithers: Uh, no sir.
-- Good thing they're not in Iraq, "$pringfield"

Marge stands in front of two slot machines, playing them simultaneously.
In boredom, Maggie spits her pacifier into the air and catches it in her
mouth repeatedly.  On one ejection, it lands in a cup full of coins
being held by a woman who walks by.  Maggie reaches for the woman, but
she's already walking away.  She crawls into a nest of feet looking for
the woman, and Marge doesn't notice her departure.

Maggie thinks she spots the woman with her pacifier, so she climbs up
onto the craps table to reach for it.

     Man: A baby on the table!  That's good luck!
Everyone: Yay!
           [The man throws the dice, and they come up double one]
Croupier: Snake-eyes.  Sorry.
Everyone: Boo!
-- Blast those 35:1 odds, "$pringfield"

Gunter and Ernst leave the circus room after their act is over.

Hillbilly: Gawrsh: it must be excitin' to live in the cuh-see-no.
   Gunter: Ja.
    Ernst: You know, we're having a party tonight...
            [Maggie pulls on Anastasia's whiskers playfully]
            [She roars and tries to bite Maggie, but Barney saves her]
   Barney: Marge, you gotta watch out.  Your little boy, Bart, could
           have been eaten by that pony!
-- Saved in the nick of time, "$pringfield"

Marge is effusively grateful: "I would never have forgiven myself," she
rues.  "Now you stay put, young lady," she says, giving her daughter a
new pacifier which she pulls from her hair.  Barney watches her go back
to pulling the handle on the slot machine.

        [Barney watches Marge gamble]
Barney: Man, that's classic compulsive behavior.
         [Sees a waitress holding a tray with three cups on it]
        Wow, free beer!
         [He chugs all three]
   Man: Buddy, those are my quarters!
         [Barney burps up some quarters]
 Woman: This guy's paying off!
-- How to win friends, "$pringfield"

{Krusty's latest gig is a "For Adults Only" show at midnight in the
casino.}

Krusty: {I don't want to hit a sore spot, but can we talk about herpes?
        Herpes herpes, bo-berpes, banana, fana fo-ferpes -- her-pes.
        Ow!
        Hey: that spot on Gorbachev's head -- herpes, trust me!
        Anybody here have herpes?  Huh?  Huh?
         [No one answers]
        You people are the worst audience I've ever seen.}
   Man: {You're the worst comedian we've ever seen!}
Krusty: {Oh, great!  Well, we'll just sit here silently for the next
        ninety minutes.}
   Man: {Fine with us.}
Krusty: {[groans and sits]}
-- Comedic lead balloons, "$pringfield"

Burns has become more of a germ-freak in the meantime.

   Burns: [spraying the monitors with disinfectant] They're all covered
          with filthy germs, aren't they Smithers?
Smithers: Why, what do you mean, sir?
           [The germs on Smithers' face grow in size before Burns' eyes]
   Germs: Freemasons run the country!
   Burns: Ew!
-- Germ back-masking, "$pringfield"

Marge continues playing the quarter slots.

Homer: Marge!  You waited for me.
Marge: Er --
Homer: OK, Marge, let's go.
Marge: I'll catch up to you.
Homer: Marge, I'm taking the car.
Marge: I'll walk.
Homer: This late?  Through the bad neighborhood?
Marge: Yeah.
Homer: Marge --
Marge: Go home!  You're bad luck.
Homer: Wait!  I see what's happening here.  You're just mad because
       everyone in this town loves gambling except for you.  Well that's
       just sad.
-- Homer Perot, "$pringfield"

Homer walks off in disgust, but Marge doesn't notice.

[End of Act Two.  Time: 14:45]

The casino is almost deserted except for Marge.  Smithers walks up to
her with two security guards.

Smithers: Er --
   Marge: [annoyed] What?
Smithers: Excuse me, ma'am: don't you think you've gambled enough?
   Marge: No!
Smithers: OK.  We're required by law to ask every 75 hours.  Get her
          another free drink.
-- Just doin' my job, "$pringfield"

At the Simpson home, dishes are piled everywhere.  Snowball II jumps out
yowling from within their midst.

Lisa: Do you get the feeling this family is disintegrating?  I mean, we
      haven't had a meal with Mom all week.  And she hasn't even started
      my costume for the geography pageant.
Bart: Pipe down, sister.  I gotta book a new act for tonight.  Turns out
      that Liza Minnelli impersonator was really Liza Minnelli.
      [shudders]
-- Wouldn't want to book her, "$pringfield"

Homer wanders in and opens the refrigerator.

 Lisa: There's nothing to eat for breakfast.
Homer: You gotta improvise, Lisa: cloves, Tom Collins mix, frozen pie
       crust --
 Lisa: Maybe mom just doesn't realize we missed her.  We could go down
       to the casino and let her know...
Homer: Oh, come on, Lisa, there's no reason to -- [takes a bite] --
       let's go see Mom.
-- Maybe there _was_ a reason, "$pringfield"

Marge compulsively gambles still.

Homer: Marge, we need to talk.  You're spending too much time at the
       casino and I think you may have a problem.
Marge: I won sixty dollars last night!
Homer: Woo-hoo!  Problem solved.
-- Elegant solutions, "$pringfield"

Burns continues to degenerate.

          [Mr. Burns hold a model airplane]
   Burns: Smithers, I've designed a new plane.  I call it the "Spruce
          Moose", and it will carry two hundred passengers from New
          York's Idyllwild Airport to the Belgian Congo in seventeen
          minutes!
Smithers: That's quite a nice model, sir.
   Burns: Model?
-- Burns' brain, slowly pickling, "$pringfield"

That night, Lisa calls out for Marge.

 Lisa: Mom!
Homer: Huh -- wha -- Lisa!  What's up?
 Lisa: I just had a bad dream!
Homer: Oh, sure.  You just lie down and tell me all about it.
 Lisa: Well, I know it's absurd, but I dreamed the bogeyman was after
       me, and he's hiding under --
Homer: Aah!  Bogeyman!  You nail the windows shut, I'll get the gun!
-- So much for parental guidance, "$pringfield"

Homer runs into Bart's room: "Bart, I don't want to alarm you, but there
may be a bogeyman or bogeymen in the house!"

Marge arrives home, squealing the tires as she stops in the driveway.
She gets to the front door and sees a hole has been torn through it, and
that chairs and other objects have been stacked against the knob.  When
she opens it, Homer peeks up from behind a bent-over mattress on the
floor, aiming the shotgun at her and quivering.  Bart, Lisa, and Maggie
look over at Marge, and everyone sighs with relief.

Marge: What happened here?
Homer: Oh, nothing, Marge.  Just a little incident involving the
       bogeyman!
        [He tosses the shotgun aside and it discharges]
       Of course, none of this would have happened if you had been here
       to keep me from acting stupid.
-- Aware of his own limitations, "$pringfield"

Marge: I'm sorry.  I _have_ been spending too much time at the casino.
       I'll be around more from now on.
 Lisa: Does this mean you'll help me with my costume?
Marge: Sure, honey.  I promise.
 Lisa: Thanks, Mom.
        [Marge hugs her]
Homer: Aw, just like on TV.
        [Homer trips on an ottoman.  A laugh-track is heard]
-- Meta-humor, "$pringfield"

At the airport, Bart holds up a sign reading "Robert Goulet".

Goulet: Hi.  You from the casino?
  Bart: I'm from _a_ casino.
Goulet: Good enough.  Let's go.
-- A Machiavellian ploy, "$pringfield"

But Mr. Goulet is supposed to perform at Burns' Casino, alongside the
Concrete and Asphalt Expo '93.  Smithers brings Mr. Burns the bad news.

Smithers: I'm afraid Robert Goulet hasn't arrived yet, sir.
   Burns: Hmm.  Very well; begin the thawing of Jim Nabors.
-- Thank God for cryogenic Gomer, "$pringfield"

Bart rides his bike home with Goulet seated atop the handlebars.  When
they arrive home, Goulet sees Nelson spelling his name on a board.

Goulet: Are you sure this is the casino?  I think I should call my
        manager.
Nelson: Your manager says for you to shut up!
Goulet: _Vera_ said that?  Hmph.
        {[struggles to climb the ladder up to the treehouse]}
-- You ought to know her well, "$pringfield"

Goulet struggles to climb the ladder up to the treehouse.

Lisa runs in in a panic.

 Lisa: Dad, Mom said she'd be home to help me with my costume and she's
       not, and the geography pageant is tonight!
Homer: Lisa, your mom still loves you.  It's just that she has a career
       now.  She's a slot-jockey.
 Lisa: But Dad, if I don't show up in a rubber suit shaped like the
       state of Florida, I'll be the laughing-stock of the whole school!
Homer: [disgusted] Oh, it's always _something_, isn't it?  First I have
       to drive your pregnant mother to the hospital so she can give
       birth to you.  And now this.
-- From bad to worse, "$pringfield"

Homer tries to sew with a needle and thread, but he keeps poking
himself.  He tries to use the sewing machine, but he pokes himself even
more often.  He starts up his blow torch, but it's for something on the
car instead.  Lisa has to remind him to work on her costume again.

Finally the costume is done.

Homer: Hello, Florida!  [tapes an orange to her, but it falls off]
 Lisa: [gasps] I'm not a state, I'm a monster!  [sobs]
Homer: [wipes a tear away] No, Lisa.  The only monster here is the
       gambling monster that has enslaved your mother!  I call him
       Gamblor, and it's time to snatch your mother from his neon claws!
-- A man of action, "$pringfield"

Homer runs into the casino and calls for his wife: "Marge!  Where are
you?  Damn this casino!"  He punches the cardboard cutout of Robert
Goulet, knocking it over.  He runs up to a crown-and-anchor-type wheel
and spins it in anger.  It comes up double stars: "Everybody wins!"
announces the man working the table.  Principal Skinner is preparing to
throw the dice at craps, but Homer forces the dice from his hand and
throws them himself.  "Seven, lucky seven!" announces the croupier.

Dave Shutton, the reporter, talks on the phone, and Homer grabs it from
him.  "He can't talk now!"  Homer states, hanging it up.  Dave looks
puzzled.  Burns watches Homer's progress across his monitors.

   Burns: Smithers, I don't want that unpredictable lunatic working in
          my casino.
Smithers: Fine, we'll transfer him to the nuclear plant, sir.
   Burns: Aw, my beloved plant.  How I miss her -- bah!  To hell with
          this.  Get my razors!  Draw a bath!  Get these kleenex boxes
          off my feet.
Smithers: Certainly, sir.  And, uh, the jars of urine?
   Burns: Oh, we'll hang onto those.  Now, to the plant!  We'll take the
          Spruce Moose.  [picks up the model] Hop in!
Smithers: But, sir --
   Burns: [pointing a gun] I said, hop in.
-- Inexorable logic, "$pringfield"

Homer dashes hither and thither, finally seeing Marge parked at one of
the slot machines.

Homer: [grabbing Marge] Yer gotta redda kid forrad yarrar!
Marge: Homer, what is it?  Slow down!
Homer: [slowly] J'yer gedda ferda redderarrar.
Marge: Think before you say each word.
Homer: You broke a promise to your child.
Marge: What?
Homer: You promised Lisa to help her with her costume.  You made her
       cry.  Then I cried.  Then Maggie laughed -- she's such a little
       trooper.
-- Maggie the Brave, "$pringfield"

Marge is aghast.  "I didn't realize.  I'm so sorry."

Homer: Marge, I want you to admit you have a gambling problem.
Marge: You know, you're right, Homer.  Maybe I should get some
       professional help.
Homer: No, no, that's too expensive.  Just don't do it any more.
-- "$pringfield"

Robert Goulet performs at Bart's Casino.

[singing]
Jingle Bells, Batman Smells
Robin laid an egg
Batmobile lost its wheel
The Joker got away, hey!
 [spoken] Thank you, thank you very much.
 [hits Milhouse in the face with the microphone]
Oh, I'm sorry, kid...
-- Robert Goulet performs for Bart and his friends, "$pringfield"

Principal Skinner hands out awards at the geography pageant

Skinner: And special awards go to the two students who obviously had no
         help from their parents: Lisa Simpson and Ralph Wiggum.
  Ralph: I'm Idaho!
Skinner: Yes, of course you are.
-- Ralph and his "Idaho" sign, "$pringfield"

Marge and Homer walk out of the casino and then along the waterfront.

Homer: You know, Marge, for the first time in our marriage I can finally
       look down my nose at you.  _You_ have a gambling problem!
Marge: That's true.  Will you forgive me?
Homer: Oh, sure.  Remember when I got caught stealing all those watches
       from Sears?
Marge: Hmm.
Homer: Well, that's nothing, because _you_ have a gambling problem!  And
       remember when I let that escaped lunatic in the house 'cause he
       was dressed like Santa Claus?
Marge: Hmm.
Homer: Well _you_ have a gambling problem!
Marge: Homer, when you forgive someone, you can't throw it back at them
       like that.
Homer: Aw, what a gyp.
        [They kiss]
Homer: Remember when I --
Marge: Homer!
Homer: Oh, yeah; I forgot already.
-- Forgive, and...forget, "$pringfield"

[End of Act Three.  Time: 21:22]

The music over the closing credits is akin to a Las Vegas show tune.
Over the "Gracie Films" logo, we hear a slot machine handle being pulled
and the rush of coins as the machine pays off.
 EPISODE TITLE: Homer the Vigilante


EPISODE SUMMARY: 
[Syndication cuts are marked in curly braces "{}" and are courtesy of
Ricardo Lafaurie and Frederic Briere.]

It's another peaceful night in Springfield.  Our favorite family are
nestled, all snug in their beds, when a shadow falls on the front door.
A man approaches with a suitcase which he places on the doorstep and
opens to reveal a large number of tools.  He seems intent on breaking
into the front door, but he doesn't need to: Homer has left his keys in
the lock.

Santa's Little Helper growls at the intruder, but he has anticipated
this: he hands the dog some sausages, and the dog whimpers and begins to
eat them.  Homer wanders in, apparently still asleep, and the intruder
holds out some sausages to him too.  He sniffs them, says "Mmm!", and
begins to eat them, still asleep and standing up.

The man enters Lisa's room first.  He pulls back her covers to reveal
that she sleeps with her saxophone at her lips.  With each exhale, she
plays the note E. The man deftly exchanged her saxophone for a party
favor.  Lisa doesn't notice the difference.

In Bart's room, the man pulls back his covers and finds Bart with the
portable TV under his arm.  Again, the intruder takes in and places a
copy of a "Coping With Loss" book in the boy's arms.  Bart mutters a
little, but he doesn't awaken.

Lastly, the man steals Marge's red pearl necklace.  She's been wearing
it for so long that each bead makes a popping noise as he pulls it
loose.  The intruder sneaks out of the house past Santa's Little Helper
and Homer, who are still asleep in the front hallway.

The next morning, Homer and the dog haven't moved.

 Bart: Dad...we've been robbed!
 Lisa: Wake up, Dad, wake up!  There was a burglar and he took my
       saxophone!
Homer: Woo-hoo!
 Bart: And our portable TV!
Homer: D'oh!
Marge: And my necklace!
Homer: Ehh, that's no big loss.
Marge: Homer, that necklace was a priceless Bouvier family heirloom.
Homer: Oh, you've probably got a whole drawer full of 'em.
Marge: Well, yes I do.  But they're all heirlooms too.
-- The morning after the burglar's visit, 

  Bart: [upset] The burglar even took my stamp collection.
  Lisa: _You_ had a stamp collection?
         [Homer, Marge, and Lisa laugh their heads off]
         [The phone rings; Bart answers it]
Nelson: Stamp collection?  Ha ha!
-- News travels fast, 

 Lisa: Bart's pain is funny, but mine isn't.  That saxophone was my one
       creative outlet.  It was the only way I could truly express
       myself.
Homer: Shh, quiet, Lisa.
-- 

Bart observes that the burglar has left his business card.  Marge reads
it: "'You have just been robbed by the Springfield Cat Burglar'...cute."
Just then, Flanders walks in.

Flanders: Heidely-ho, neighborinos!
   Homer: Can't talk.  Robbed.  Go hell.
Flanders: Heh.  You folks got robbed too?  The burglar took my Shroud of
          Turin beach towels.
    Bart: Wow, it's a crime wave!
-- Misplaced adoration, 

Principal Skinner is despondent that day as well.  "Good Lord!" he
exclaims, "My Stormin' Norman commemorative plates stolen!...again."
{Barney wakes up in the middle of his floor, naked, in an empty
apartment.  "Hey, I thought I had more stuff than this."}

 Lisa: {We _are_ insured, aren't we, Mom?}
Marge: {Homer, tell your child what you bought when I sent you to town
       to get some insurance.}
Homer: {Curse you, magic beans!}
Marge: {Oh, stop blaming the beans.}
-- 

Homer decides to report the robbery to the Springfield police.

 Homer: Hello, Police?  Are you sitting down?  Good!  I wish to report a
        robbery.
Wiggum: [bored] A robbery, right.  Thanks for the report.  [hangs up]
        That's _another_ one, Lou...723 Evergreen Terrace.
         [Looks at a map with the robbery locations marked on it]
        Well, there doesn't seem to be any pattern yet, but if I take
        this one and move it here...and I move these over here...hello!
        It _almost_ looks like an arrow!
   Lou: Hey, look, Chief: it's pointing right at this police station.
Wiggum: Let's get out of here!
-- Deduction at its finest, 

The Springfield Shopper announces the news of the burglary in its
headlines.  Kent Brockman reports on the bad news.

     Kent: When cat burglaries start, can mass murders be far behind?
           This reporter isn't saying that the burglar is an inhuman
           monster like the Wolfman, but he very well could be.  So,
           professor: would you say it's time for everyone to panic?
Professor: Yes I would, Kent.
-- Reasoned judgement, 

At a press conference, Chief Wiggum reports on the police's progress.

Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen -- please.  We have a major
break in the case.  We recovered the burglar's hankerchief from one of
the crime scenes.  Now, one sniff of this baby, and our tracking dog
will be hot on his trail.
Gosh, look at me, I'm...sweating like a pig here.  [wipes himself] Oh...
aw man...that's better.
All right, get the scent, boy.  [dog sniffs it] Come on, get the scent.
Now kill!
 [Dog jumps at his throat]
Oh!  Ow!  Hey!  Oh, my jugular, argh!  Ooh!  Any questions?
-- Chief Wiggum at the press conference, 

Professor John Frink has even come up with a plan to foil the burglar: a
house that runs away on giant feet when the burglar trips the alarm.
His miniature demonstration model trips and falls, however, bursting
into flames.  Little wooden people fall out of the house, burning.  "The
real humans won't, er, wo -- won't burn quite so fast," he consoles
sheepishly.

{As Bart walks down the street the next day, many bars automatically
slam shut in front of windows.  He stops in front of one house and says,
"Cool: high-tech security system!"  He tosses a pebble at the house, and
two lasers follow its course while a third one blasts the pebble to
dust.  The house next door gets up on two giant legs and begins running
away from Bart, but it trips and bursts into flame.}

{The house with the lasers draws all the neighborhood kids.  They toss
stones at it and watch them getting destroyed.  "All right!" grooves
Otto, "Free laserium!  All the colors of the 'bow, man!"  Just then,
Jasper walks by and gets zapped in the eyes by a laser.}

        {[a laser hits Jasper in the eyes]
Jasper: Oh!...my cataracts are gone.  I can see again!  All the beauty
        of na --
         [Another laser hits him in the eyes]
        I'm blind.  Oh well: easy come, easy go.}
-- Jasper's nonchalance over sight, 

At the Springfield Retirement Home, Abe sleeps.  His door opens and a
shadow appears at it.

   Abe: Oh!  It's the Cat Burglar.  Please don't kill me!
Malloy: Abe, can I borrow your ointment?
   Abe: Oh, it's you, Malloy.  All right -- but this time, clean off the
        applicator!
-- A close call, 

Apu is even frightened: when a man drives up to the Kwik-E-Mart and gets
out of his car, Apu takes a shot at him with a shotgun from his perch
atop the roof of the building.  The man hurries off, and Apu shouts
after him, "Thank you for coming.  I'll see you in Hell."

Homer decides to lay down some new rules for the family.

Homer: All right: these are our new family security rules.  Be home
       before dark, and make sure you're not followed.  Lock all doors
       and windows.
Marge: And don't take candy from strangers.
Homer: [plaintive] Marge, they're only human!
-- 

 Lisa: What's the point of all these precautions?  I've already lost the
       only thing that matters to me.
Homer: Oh, Lisa, stop pining for your saxophone.  I got you another
       instrument.
 Lisa: What, this jug?
        [She blows its spout, producing two alternating tones in rhythm]
        [Homer begins to laugh and cheer, but Lisa stops]
Homer: Lisa, never _ever_ stop in the middle of a hoedown!
-- 

Lisa starts to cry.  Homer says, "Oh honey, I didn't realize how much
that horn meant to you.  Don't worry; Daddy's going to get it back.  I
don't know how, but I'll figure out something."  Lisa thanks him.  Homer
continues, "You know, Lisa, music helps Daddy think."  She starts
blowing the jug again, and Homer dances in place while thinking.

The Springfield Shopper asks rhetorically, "Is Nothing Safe?"
Apparently the answer is no: the Cat Burglar steals the paper, leaving
his business card in its place.  Flanders has a meeting in his rumpus
room.

Flanders: Welcome, neighbors.  Since the police can't seem to get off
          their dufferoonies to do something about this burglarino, I
          think it's time we started our own neighborhood watch...
          eroony!
           [Everyone cheers]
          Now, who should lead the group?
     Man: You!
Everyone: Yay!  Flanders!  Flanders!  Flanders!
Flanders: I don't really have very much experience, but I'll --
     Moe: Someone else!
Everyone: Yay!  Someone else!  Someone else!  Someone else!
   Homer: _I'm_ someone else.
   Lenny: He's right!
   Homer: We don't need a thinker.  We need a doer: someone who'll act
          without considering the consequences.
Everyone: Homer!  Homer!  Homer!
-- How quickly they sway, 

    Barney: I'm with you, Homer!
McAllister: I be with ya too, matey.
   Skinner: I'm with you, Homer.
       Moe: You're the man, Homer.
       Apu: You should do it.
      Otto: You're the man, man.
       Abe: I'll join!  I'm filled with piss and vinegar.  At first I
            was just filled with vinegar.
     Homer: Hmm...sorry, Dad.  You're too old.
       Abe: [stammers] Too old?  Why, that just means I have experience.
            Who chased the Irish out of Springfield village in aught
            four?  Me, that's who!
 Irish man: And a fine job you did, too.
     Homer: Aw, Dad.  You've done a lot of great things, but you're a
            very old man now, and old people are useless.  [tickles Abe]
            Aren't they?  Aren't they?  Huh?  Yes they are!  Yes they
            are!  Tee hee --
       Abe: Stop it!  That's a form of abuse.
-- Father and son, 

Moe, Homer, McAllister, and Skinner all check out their own shotguns in
the Simpson home.

     Marge: I don't think the guns are a good idea.
     Homer: Marge!  We're responsible adults.  And --
       Moe: [shoots] Whoops.
     Homer: And if a group of responsible adults can't handle firearms
            in a responsible way --
McAllister: [shoots] Sorry.
   Skinner: [shoots] Uh oh.
       Moe: [shoots] Me again.
      Bart: [shoots] Sorry.
-- You were saying?, 

[End of Act One.  Time: 8:05]

{At Moe's Tavern, Homer and Barney shake hands back to back, reaching
through their legs.}

Homer: {OK, we've got the secret vigilante handshake.  Now we need code
       names.  I'll be Cue-Ball, Skinner can be Eight-Ball, Barney will
       be Twelve-Ball, and Moe, you can be Cue-Ball.}
  Moe: {You're an idiot.}
-- No, Moe can be Lucille Ball, 

The men check out the display of weapons at Herman's store.  {The shot
of Herman's is shortened by a second in syndication.}

Herman: So...wedding, huh?
 Homer: No, we're forming a vigilante group.
-- An easy mistake to make, 

Herman entreats Homer to go with him.

 Herman: See, it's a miniature version of the A-Bomb.  The government
         built it in the fifties to drop on beatniks.
          [Homer imagines a beatnik on the grass with a bongo]
Beatnik: Radiant cool, crazy nightmare
         Zen New Jersey nowhere...
          [A group of beatniks snap their fingers in time]
          [Homer flies overhead in a plane]
  Homer: Put this in your pipe and smoke it!
          [Presses a button, but the A-Bomb doesn't fall]
Beatnik: How now, brown bureaucrat?
          [Homer jumps on the bomb, and it falls with him still on it.
         He cheers as though he's riding a bronco]
          [It explodes, bringing us back to reality]
         Take that, Maynard G. Krebs!
 Herman: Hey...see the sign?  ["Do not ride the bomb"]
  Homer: Sorry.
-- Eradication of undesirables, 

The vigilante group is now outfitted and ready to go.  Homer inspects
their uniforms.

  Homer: OK, men, it's time to clean up this town!
Skinner: Meaning what, exactly?
  Homer: You know, push people around, make ourselves feel big.
-- A noble directive, 

Homer gets in a motorcycle sidecar with Barney as the driver, and he
demands that Bart give him his megaphone.  "It's not just _a_ megaphone,
Dad, it's a Rapmaster 2000," Bart explains, but Homer grabs it
nonetheless, figuring he must whip the neighborhood into shape.  As he
uses it, a beat emanates from it under his voice, and the neighborhood
children mistake Homer for Hammer.  The follow the motorcycle, dancing
and gyrating, ignoring Homer's warning to return to their homes and
places of businesseses.

On one of the patrols, the vigilante group come upon a college student
playing a saxophone for money on the street.

  Homer: Hey, you!  Where did you get that saxophone?
Student: [pause] Sears.
  Homer: Get him!
-- Mistaken identity, 

On another patrol, they come across a man burning leaves in his yard.
{The man takes a puff of his cigarette.}  "No burning leaves without a
permit!"  Homer rudely informs him, as the members of the group kick the
burning leaves all around.  "I got one," the man protests, but it is too
late.  The vigilantes run off, and the man has to douse the leaves
before they burn his house to the ground.

They come upon Jimbo who is spray painting "carpe diem" on a wall.

Homer: You better have a good reason for doing that, boy.
Jimbo: It makes me feel like a big man.
Homer: Let me check my reason list.  ...Yep!  It's on here.
Jimbo: Hey!  You're that drunken posse.  Wow...can I join ya?
Homer: [skeptical] I don't know...can you swing a sack of door knobs?
Jimbo: _Can_ I?
Homer: You're in!  Here's the sack.
  Moe: But you gotta supply your own knobs.
-- A small price to pay, 

That night at dinner, Homer relates his antics to the rest of the
family.

Homer: So I said to him, "Look, buddy, your car was upside down when we
       got here.  And as for your Grandma, she shouldn't have mouthed
       off like that!"
 Lisa: Dad, don't you see you're abusing your power like all vigilantes?
       I mean, if you're the police, who will police the police?
Homer: I dunno.  Coast Guard?
-- You scratch my back..., 

Marge: Homer, wasn't the whole point to catch the Cat Burglar?
 Lisa: And I still don't have my saxophone.
Homer: Lisa, the mob is working on getting your saxophone back.  But
       we've also expanded into other important areas.  [reads a list]
       Literacy programs, preserving our beloved covered bridges, world
       domination --
 Lisa: World domination?
Homer: Oh ho, heh, that might be a typo.
        [thinks] Mental note: the girl knows too much.
-- Precocious eight-year-olds, 

Homer is invited to be a guest on Smartline.  Kent Brockman interviews
him.

 Kent: Mr. Simpson, how do you respond to the charges that petty
       vandalism such as graffiti is down eighty percent, while heavy
       sack-beatings are up a shocking nine hundred percent?
Homer: Aw, people can come up with statistics to prove anything, Kent.
       Forfty percent of all people know that.
 Kent: I see.  Well, what do you say to the accusation that your group
       has been causing more crimes than it's been preventing?
Homer: [amused] Oh, Kent, I'd be lying if I said my men weren't
       committing crimes.
 Kent: [pause] Well, touche'.
-- Effective interview responses, 

       [phone rings]
 Kent: Well it looks like we have our first caller...and I mean ever,
       because this is not a call-in show.  Hello, you're on the air.
  Man: Hello, Kent.  Hello, Homer -- my arch-nemesis.
Homer: Y'ello.
  Man: You _do_ realize who this is?
Homer: Uh...Marge?
  Man: No, Homer, I'm not your wife.  Although, I do enjoy her pearls.
       As a matter of fact, I'm holding them right now: listen.  [plays
       with them]
Homer: Why you monster.  And you have my daughter's saxophone too!
        [He strangles someone off camera]
 Kent: Homer!  That's our stage manager.
Homer: Oh...heh, sorry.  I'm a little nervous.
-- No great loss, 

  Man: You may be interested to know that for my next crime, I'll be
       pinching the pride and joy of the Springfield Museum -- the
       world's largest cubic zirconia.
Homer: Listen, Mr. Cat Burglar, I vow to go without sleep and guard the
       Springfield Museum day and night for as long as it takes from now
       on.  Unless you want to taunt me more by giving me an approximate
       time...
        [no answer]
        [sweetly] We'll be right back.
 Kent: I get to say that!
-- No fair, 

Homer stands outside the museum.  Abe, Jasper, and Malloy approach him.

  Abe: Son, we want to help you catch that plug-ugly yegg.
Homer: [sweet] Dad, the best way for you to help is to set a good
       example.  [serious] Just stand around and don't steal anything.
        [He turns away, but suddenly turns back, noticing Abe and Jasper
       carting something from the museum] Hey!
  Abe: We're on our break!
-- Oh, _that_ justifies it, 

Homer walks up to Skinner.

Skinner: Any sign of the burglar yet?
  Homer: He'll show.
Skinner: How's that?
  Homer: It's his job.
Skinner: How's that?
  Homer: He's a burglar.
-- Socratic questioning, 

Homer and Skinner nod at one another as the theme music from "Dragnet"
plays.

Well, Mr. Cat Burglar, you'd like to get in here, wouldn't you?  There's
just one little problem: 36 years ago, some lady gave birth to a man
named Homer J. Simp -- ohmigod: underage kids drinking beer without a
permit!
-- Homer guards the Springfield Museum, 

The Cat Burglar wastes no time in taking advantage of the situation.  He
walks into the museum and flips the alarm switch, ignoring the "Do not
turn off" warning on it, and the glass surrounding the monstrous bogus
diamond lowers.  He sneaks away as three teenagers encourage Homer to
chug a beer.

The Springfield Shopper announces the next day, "Zirconia Ztolen!", and
accuses Homer of being asleep.  The picture shows Homer passed out with
beer cans all around him.

Homer: "Asleep at the switch"?  I wasn't asleep, I was drunk!
 Bart: I believe you, Dad.
-- Your sympathy is touching, 

Homer realizes he's still got a job to do, and he walks out the front
door, only to be pelted by fruit and vegetables.  Barney yells, "Go
home, Simpson!"  Jimbo walks up to Homer and empties a sack full of
doorknobs in front of him.

Jimbo: You let me down, man.  Now I don't believe in nothing no more.
       I'm going to law school
Homer: Noo!
 Lisa: Dad...maybe this will cheer you up.  [plays her jug]
Homer: Aw, this doesn't work any more.  [Lisa stops] I didn't say stop!
-- The healing power of hoedown, 

[End of Act Two.  Time: 14:37]

As Homer picks the fruit from his body, Marge finally realized how much
the town loved the giant zirconia.  Abe walks in.

 Abe: Let me through!  Let me through.
Lisa: Oh, Grampa, they pelted you too?
 Abe: No, actually, I fell down at the Big Boy.
-- Great free-food scams, 

  Abe: Son, I've come to help you.  I know who the Cat Burglar is.
Homer: What?
Marge: Who?
 Bart: Huh?
 Lisa: What?
  Abe: [triumphant] Well, well, well!  Before I was just too old, and no
       one wanted my help.  Suddenly, look who comes to old Grampa --
       wait!  Where are you going?  [meek] Come back, I'll tell you.
-- No gloating allowed, 

  Abe: He was right under my nose the whole time.  He lives in my
       retirement home.  His name is Malloy.
 Lisa: Wow!  How'd you track him down, Grampa?
  Abe: Good question!  On one of my frequent trips to the ground, I
       noticed Malloy wore sneakers...for sneaking.
       My next clue came yesterday at the museum.  We felt slighted by
       your age-bashing, and started home.  Malloy said, "I'll catch up
       with you."
        [Malloy shoots a rope over the building]
       I couldn't quite put my finger on it.  There was something
       strange about the way he walked -- much more vertical than usual.
       And finally, Malloy, unlike most retired people, has the world's
       largest cubic zirconia on his coffee table.
Homer: Aw, Dad, I could kiss you!
  Abe: Well, kiss me right here.  It's the only part that still has
       feelings.
-- Sherlock Abe, 

Homer walks outside, and everyone cocks their arm, but Homer stops them
by saying he knows where the burglar is.  "To the retirement home!"
yells Abe, and everyone cheers.  They all rush off and accost Malloy.

Skinner: And there she is: the world's largest cubic zirconia.
    Moe: What an eyesore!
  Homer: So, Mr. Malloy, it seems that the cat has been caught by the
         very person who was trying to catch him.
Skinner: How ironic.
-- Moronic, that is, 

Malloy: Homer, old chap, well done.  If anyone was going to catch me,
        I'm glad it was you.
 Homer: Actually, it wasn't me, it was my dad, Grampa.
   Abe: Thanks, Son.  So you see, old people aren't so useless after
        all.  Malloy's old, and he outsmarted the lot of you.  And I'm
        even older and I outsmarted him!  Ah ha ha ha --
   Moe: Shut up.
   Abe: [meek] I've had my moment.
-- You'll have fourteen more, 

Malloy: And of course, I'm happy to return all of your treasured
        possessions.
         [Everyone talks with surprise]
        Selma, my dear: your lock of MacGyver's hair.
 Selma: Thank you.  I'll add it to the ball.
-- That's why he's going bald, 

  Malloy: And little Lisa: here's your saxophone.
    Lisa: Thank you.  And thank you, Dad.  You got it back -- just like
          you said you would.
  Malloy: I sincerely regret any inconvenience that I may have caused.
          And although I have stolen your material goods, let me assure
          you that your dear town has stolen my heart.
Everyone: Aw!
 Skinner: Oh, he's so charming.
  Barney: Let's let him go!
Everyone: Yeah!
  Wiggum: Oh, sorry folks.  [sarcastic] Gee, I really hate to spoil this
          little love-in, but Mr. Malloy broke the law.  And when you
          break the law, you gotta go to jail.
  Quimby: Uh, that reminds me, er, here's your monthly kickback.
  Wiggum: You just -- you couldn't have picked a worse time.
-- Kickbacks aren't illegal, they're in the Springfield Towne Charter,
    

Homer gloats outside Malloy's prison cell.

 Homer: I caught the Cat Burglar!  I caught the Cat Burglar!  That means
        you-ou!  You are the Cat Burglar!
Malloy: I suppose you're wondering where I hid all the millions of
        dollars I stole over the years.
 Homer: Shut up!
Wiggum: No, wait a minute -- maybe we should, er, hear him out.  Where'd
        you hide the loot, Malloy?
Malloy: It's buried right here in Springfield...under a big T.
 Homer: No...kidding?
Wiggum: Big T, huh?
 Homer: [backing away] Well...I guess I'll be going to my home now,
        and...sleep.
Wiggum: Yeah...me too...I will also go home...for sleep.
-- Dripping with nonchalance, 

Eddie, Lou, Wiggum, and Homer frantically run out of the jail.  Homer
pushes people aside, yelling how he must find a big T. "There's millions
of dollars buried under a big T!"  People look at the Big T Building,
Big T Burgers and Fries, the Tea Factory, and the Big T Theater
(featuring Ice T and Booker T), but no one finds anything.  They all
rush to the jail.

Wiggum: We need more information.
Malloy: Very well.  It's buried at 4723 Maple Valley Road.
         [Everyone stares blankly]
         [sighs] You take highway 201 south for 15 minutes.  You take a
        left -- a left --
-- On a silver platter, 

Marge hops in the motorcycle and Homer in the sidecar while the other
citizens of Springfield drive in whatever they can.  Barney flies a
biplane with Selma and Patty in the other seats straight through a Duff
billboard.  A man in a convertible drives in what he thought was a
shallow stream, but his car gets lower and lower in the water.  Bart
watches with a grin as the man sinks, and Bart waves goodbye.

Kent Brockman reports on the situation.

     Kent: Hordes of panicky people seem to be evacuating the town for
           some unknown reason.  Professor, without knowing precisely
           what the danger is, would you say it's time for our viewers
           to crack each other's heads open and feast on the goo inside?
Professor: Mmm, yes I would, Kent.
-- A reasoned opinion, 

People arrive helter-skelter at the address given by Malloy.  It has a
palm tree shaped like a T planted in the ground there.  Several men
begin shoveling and picking away at the ground with their shirts off as
others look on anxiously.  Snake even licks his chops in anticipation.
Eventually Otto hits paydirt.

  Otto: I found something!  [pulls a briefcase from the ground]
Wiggum: [opens it] It's just a piece of paper.
 Homer: It's mine!  [reads] "Frightfully sorry, but there is no hidden
        treasure.  I have already used this time to escape from your
        jail.  Fondest wishes" -- oh, I can't make out the signature!
Quimby: Keep digging.  We're bound to find something!
-- Missing the point, 

They do as Quimby suggests, until there are only a few of them at the
bottom of a hole forty or fifty feet deep.

Quimby: I guess we're not going to find anything.
  Otto: Um, how are we going to get out of here?
 Homer: We'll dig our way out!
Wiggum: No, dig _up_, stupid.
-- 

[End of Act Three.  Time: 20:55]

The theme music at the end has an oom-pah-pah bass, and it sounds more
goofy than usual (this ties in with the "It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad,
World" theme.)
 EPISODE TITLE: Bart Gets Famous


EPISODE SUMMARY: 
[Syndication cuts are marked in curly braces "{}" and are courtesy of
Ricardo Lafaurie and Frederic Briere.]

At the Simpsons' breakfast table, Homer reads the newspaper.

Ah, the morning horoscope.  "Today will be a day like every other day"
-- D'oh!  It just gets worse and worse.
-- Homer the pessimist, 

Bart walks down the stairs in his lucky red hat, whistling the theme
music to "The Simpsons".  Marge chides him for whistling "that annoying
tune."  Bart responds cheerfully, "Jahwol, mein Mommerant."

 Lisa: [to Bart] Why are you so happy?
Homer: Yeah.  You kids gotta go to school, I gotta go to work; the only
       one who has it easy is Marge.
        [Marge scrubs at the floor, grunting]
-- Easy is relative, 

Bart: We're having a field trip today!  Ah, Lis, won't it be great to
      cast of the shackles of the soul-crushing hellhole that is
      Springfield Elementary?  [sarcastically] Oh, I'm sorry, I forgot:
      your class isn't going!
Lisa: You're right, Bart: school is for losers.
       [fade to Lisa's future mansion]
       [Her wall covered with awards]
       [typing] "And that's how I cured all disease, ended war, and
      reunited the entire cast of TV's `Facts of Life', including long-
      time holdout, Tootie."
Bart: [polishing Lisa's awards] [groans] Sounds like another Pulitzer
      for me to polish.
Lisa: Hush, field-trip boy!
       [Lisa kicks Bart]
      Impaled on my Nobel Peace Prize: how ironic.
       [back to reality]
Bart: Yo, Lis: Lis!  Come back, Lis!  Come back!
Lisa: [dreamy] Why?  I'm so much happier here.
-- 

In the fourth-grade classroom, Mrs. Krabappel introduces Seymour.

   Edna: And now, Principal Skinner will tell us where we'll be going on
         this year's field trip.
Skinner: Thank you, Edna, everyone.  [clears throat] Now, class, I
         wonder who among you can tell me what this is?  [shows a box]
   Edna: Oh, not the box factory again, Seymour!
          [Class groans]
 Martin: This may well prove fascinating!
   Bart: I know: I'll just do like Lisa and escape into fantasy!
          [Bart imagines Seymour]
Skinner: Class, instead of going to the box factory today, we'll be
         going to the...box factory!
   Bart: Damn TV, you've ruined my imagination, just like you've ruined
         my ability to -- to, um...uh...oh well.  [Turns on Itchy &amp;
         Scratchy on a portable TV]
-- The source of the world's problems, 

On the bus to the factory, Martin and Seymour sing a duet: "Fifty-six
boxes of bottles of beer on the wall, fifty-six boxes of bottles of
beer, you take one down and pass it around, fifty-five boxes of bottles
of beer on the wall."  Just then, they drive by an amusement park,
complete with fireworks testing range and slide factory.  School buses
from many other places are parked in front, and most of grade four
(including Mrs. Krabappel) stare longingly out the window, but their bus
drives on.

Arriving at the box factory, Skinner and Martin are the first ones off
the bus.  Bart and Edna walk off together, looking bored.

Once inside the factory, their tour guide tells them a story.

The story of how two brothers (and five other men) parlayed a small
business loan into a thriving paper-goods concern is a long and
interesting one.  And, here it is: it all began with the filing of form
637/A, the application for a small business or farm...
-- The box factory's tour guide, 

At the end of the story, the tour guide continues.

   Guide: Many interesting and important things have been put into boxes
          over the years: textiles, other boxes, even children's candy.
Milhouse: Do any of these boxes have candy in them?
   Guide: No.
Milhouse: Will they ever?
   Guide: No, we only make boxes to ship nails.  Any other questions?
  Martin: When will we be able to see a finished box, Sir?
   Guide: Well, we don't assemble them here -- that's done in Flint,
          Michigan.
    Bart: Have any of the workers ever had their hands cut off by the
          machinery?
   Guide: No --
    Bart: And then the hand started crawling around and tried to
          strangle everybody?
   Guide: No, that has never happened.
    Bart: Any popped eyeballs?
   Guide: I'm not sure what kind of factory you're thinking of; we just
          make boxes here.
-- Q&amp;A at the box factory, 

   Guide: This room is the most popular part of our tour.
Milhouse: It's just like the other rooms.
   Guide: Yes, but with one important difference: [looks over] Oh, they
          took that out.  Yes, it is just like the other rooms.
Milhouse: [pointing out the window] What's that building over there?
   Guide: That's just a TV studio where they film Krusty the Klown and
          other non-box-related programs.  Since it has nothing to do
          with boxes, I'll just shut these blinds.
-- Keeping attention focused, 

The tour guide shows them his office, and calls their attention to the
yellow line entering the room, encircling his desk, and leaving the
room.  He entreats them to follow it.  Seymour and Martin go first, and
everyone follows in a line.  Everyone, that is, except Bart.  "I gotta
get out of here," he says desperately.  "Ah ha!" he exclaims, spying a
laundry cart, "The perfect escape!"  He runs over to it, looks around,
and jumps in.  Nothing happens, so he gets out again and walks out a
door marked "Emergency Exit".

He wanders over to the aforementioned TV studio, and looks around near
the entrance gate.  A security guard wearing mirrored shades approaches
him.

Guard: [condescending] Do you work here, little boy?
 Bart: Yeah!
Guard: [formal] Well then, go right in, Sir!
-- Bart's deceptive!, 

Meanwhile, the rest of the fourth graders scour the box factory looking
for Bart.

Skinner: [to Edna] I'll handle this.  Simpson!  I'm giving you till the
         count of three to come out!  One, two, three!  [pause] I've
         done all I can do.
   Edna: We better call his parents.
  Marge: [Runs dripping from the shower toward the ringing phone]
         Just a minute!  Don't hang up!
          [picks up the phone, but it's dead]
         Mmm...
   Edna: No answer at home; I'll call his father.
  Homer: [Runs with a towel around his waist toward the phone]
         Just a minute!  Don't hang up!
         Y'ello?  You'll have to speak up, I'm wearing a towel.
-- 

Inside the studio, Bart looks around at the hustle and bustle.  He
wanders past some workmen carrying a tropical beach scene, and in front
of the set of Chespirito, the Spanish bee.

     Ethan: Action!
Chespirito: [With a lobster on his tail] Ay, ay, ay!  No me gusta!
             [stops] I'm sorry, I'm really not comfortable with this,
            Ethan.
     Ethan: What's the matter, love?
Chespirito: It's just -- it's, it's the same old tired gags, isn't it?
            I mean, let's give the audience some credit.
     Ethan: How about a giant mousetrap?
Chespirito: I love it!
             [someone gets a giant mousetrap]
     Ethan: Action!
Chespirito: Ay, ay, ay!  No me gusta!  Ay, es grande!
-- Ah, much better, 

Homer has arrived at the box factory, and he is livid.

Homer: [to Skinner] Whaddaya mean, you lost him?  He might have fallen
       into one of these machines!  [turns]
       Oh, my God: that's his lucky red hat.  He's a box!  My boy's a
       box!  Damn you, a box!
-- Tragedy befalls Homer, 

Meanwhile, Bart walks up to Krusty while he nags an employee.  "I said I
wanted a danish!"  Krusty berates, and the employee apologizes, saying
all the danishes were gone.  "They're not gone," riposts Krusty, "You're
gone!"  Bart looks down guiltily at the danish he stole.

Kent Brockman prepares his newscast for that evening.

[reading] "Tragic news tonight: 120 dead in a tidal wave in Kuala Lala
-- pure.  Kuala Lum -- per..."
 [crosses it out] "France!"
-- Kent Brockman acts like Mike Wallace, 

Bart runs up to Kent's desk and steals the danish on it, saying "Yoink!"
Kent looks up, surprised.  He notices his danish is missing, and he
gasps.

Krusty: Aw, heck: now where am I gonna get a danish?
  Bart: Here's a danish, Krusty!
Krusty: Gimme, gimme, gimme!  [devours it] Now that's danish!  Where'd
        you get it?
  Bart: I stole it from Kent Brockman.
Krusty: Great!  [realizes] Uh, he didn't touch it, did he?
  Bart: No.
Krusty: Good job, kid!  What's your name?
  Bart: I'm Bart Simpson.  I saved you from jail.
Krusty: [not remembering] Er, I...
  Bart: I reunited you with your estranged father.
Krusty: Er, uh, I don't know...
  Bart: I saved your career, man!  Remember your comeback special?
Krusty: Yeah, well, what have you done for me lately?
  Bart: I got you that danish.
Krusty: [grateful] And I'll never forget it.
-- It's the little things he remembers, 

Krusty starts to walk off, and Bart wanders away, hands in pockets,
dejected.  But Krusty calls out, "Hey, kid!"  Bart turns around
hopefully, and Krusty tosses him something.  "Wow: a big clown hankie!"
he says, a trifle surprised, and Krusty scoffs, "It's a towel, you yutz!
I want you to wash it: you're my new assistant."  Bart exclaims, "Cool!"

Kent Brockman sits at his news desk.

      Kent: Yeah, I know I'm on.  But I don't care.  I _don't_ read the
            news until I get my danish.  Go ahead, try to find a
            replacement.
             [Chespirito runs over and pushes him aside]
Chespirito: A powerful tidal wave in Kuala Lumpur has killed one hundred
            and twenty people.  [jumps up] Ay, chihuahua!  Whoa, whoa,
            whoa!
-- News with actions, 

[End of Act One.  Time: 8:13]

Homer has to break the bad news about Bart to Marge.

Homer: [holding a box with a red hat on top]
       Marge, I have some horrible, bone-chilling news!
Marge: [gasps] What is it?
 Bart: Hi, Homer.
Homer: Oh...nothing.
-- Crisis averted, everything is super, 

 Bart: Hey, that's my lucky red hat sitting on top of a double-
       corrugated, eight-fold, fourteen-gauge box!
Marge: Oh, it sounds like you really learned something on your field
       trip.  Think you'd be interested in a career as a box maker?
 Bart: Well, that'll always be the dream...
-- 

Bart then tells Marge he's got a job in the show business, helping
Krusty the Klown after school.

Marge: Hmm, I don't know, Bart.  You're only ten.
 Lisa: I've got a weekend job helping the poor and I'm only eight.
Homer: [scoffs] That's not a job, it's a waste of time.  What can poor
       people pay you?  Nothing!  What satisfaction you get from helping
       them?  None!  Who wants to help poor people anyway?  Nobody!
        [Marge, Lisa, and Bart stare at him]
 Bart: So, anyway...
-- Homer the Generous, 

    Bart: Can I, Mom?  Can I take the job?
   Marge: Well --
   Homer: Why not?  I remember my first after school job.  I was in a
          band.
           [Flashback to Homer wearing many instruments and holding a
          guitar]
          Hello, everybody.  I'm Archie Bell, and I'm also the Drells.
          I've got a new song called "Tighten Up," and this is the music
          you tighten up with!
           [starts playing; everyone leaves, and an organ grinder chides
          him]
Giuseppe: Hey, what's-a matter you?  You crazy kid, you chasing away my
          business-a.
   Homer: Buzz off, Giuseppe.
Giuseppe: [to his monkey] A-Pepe, go for the face-a!
           [The monkey does so, and Homer falls over and screams]
          Yes, son, you can have an electric guitar just like your old
          man.
    Bart: Dad, I'm asking if I can get a job.
   Homer: [condescending] Gig, son.  When you're a musician, a job is
          called a "gig".
-- Attack of the killer organ grinder's monkey, 

Bart stands at the set of Krusty's show, watching as Gina Ballerina
tries to coax a monkey to jump through a hoop.

   Bart: Wow.  Bein' in show business is like a dream.  We're really
         lucky, aren't we?
Workman: I wish I was dead.
 Krusty: Don't listen to him, kid.  This is a dream factory, the
         birthplace of magic -- an enchantment!  Now I need you to go
         clean out my toilet.
          [guides Bart over to it]
         Right in here, boy: it -- ew!  I don't know _what_ I was
         thinking last night.  This'll take you a couple hours.
-- 

Bart tries to convince Milhouse, Martin, and Nelson that he really does
work for Krusty.  He shows them a videotape of the show.

    Bart: I'm telling you, I _do_ work on the Krusty show.  Look at the
          credits!  [presses "play"]
  Krusty: Bye bye, kids!  [laughs]
           [credits roll]
    Kent: I'm Kent Brockman.  On the eleven o'clock news tonight, a
          certain kind of soft drink has been found to be lethal.  We
          won't tell you which one until after sports and the weather
          with Funny Sonny Storm.
    Bart: [presses "pause"] There's my name, right there: Bart Simpson.
Milhouse: Looks more like Brad Stortch.
  Martin: No!  It says Betty -- Betty Symington.
  Nelson: [punches Bart in the gut] That's for taking credit for other
          people's work.
-- Punishment for usurping, 

Homer: It's OK, son.  Who cares what a bunch of fourth-graders think?
       You're doing what _you_ want to do with your life.  Nothing else
       matters.
 Bart: [grateful] Thanks, Dad.  That's great advice.
Homer: Yep, well, that's what got me where I am today.
 Bart: [groans]
Homer: There, there.
-- Admission of uselessness, 

At the Monstro Mart, Krusty is signing autographs.  Well, actually, he
sits on a stool smoking, and _Bart_ signs the autographs.  When a little
girl asks Krusty to sign her picture, he points her towards a long line
of children, at the head of which Bart sits at a table writing "KRUSTY"
in pencil on photos of the klown.  Bart groans, and the girl calls out,
"I love you, Krusty!"

In class, the next day...

  Edna: OK, kids, open your books to page sixty --
         [a phone rings; Bart wakes up and pulls it from his pocket]
  Bart: [tired] Yes, Krusty?
Krusty: Bart, I need to get your fingerprints on a candlestick.  Meet me
        in the conservatory, chop-chop.  Don't worry: everything's gonna
        be aaaall right.
  Bart: Oh, I wish I was dead.
-- You may get your wish soon, 

After school, Bart hands out food to the cast of Krusty's show.

 Mel: [spits out food] Pah!  There's cheese in this sandwich.  Surely
      you know I'm lactose-intolerant?
Bart: [bored] Sorry.
 Mel: Sorry?  Do you know how sick this is going to make me?  [groans]
      Oh, boy.  Come and stand next to the bathroom door; I want to yell
      at you some more.
-- Bart, scapegoat for abuse, 

Sideshow Mel rants at Bart, but soon the boy finds it tiresome.  "Show
business sucks," he says, walking dejectedly towards the exit.

Krusty: Bart!  I need to use you in a sketch.
  Bart: You want me to be on the show?
Krusty: It's just one line.  Mel's supposed to say it, but he's dead.
  Bart: Dead?
Krusty: Or sick, I dunno.  I forget.  Anyway, all you gotta do is say,
        "I am waiting for a bus."  Then I hit you with pies for five
        minutes.  Got that?
  Bart: "I am waiting for a bus."
Krusty: Makes _me_ laugh.  Let's go!
-- Humor for the masses, 

On a set taken from the early 1900s, a mustached Krusty stands next to a
pie cart.  He motions for a mustached Bart to walk in, which Bart does.
"I am waiting for a -- whoa!"  Bart says, bumping into a prop.  He
knocks over a couple more props, and then the backdrop starts to shake.
It falls off its support, dragging a couple of spotlights with it.  Bart
excuses himself hurriedly with "I didn't do it."  Everyone in the
audience starts to laugh and clap as Bart looks around in amazement.

Krusty: Oh, man.  It's a miracle we got through that one.  Remind me
        never to let you on stage again, kid.  Some people got it, some
        people don't, and _you_, my young friend, do not have -- hold
        on, I want to finish this thought outside --
         [Opens the door; a crowd awaits]
   Man: It's that kid!
         [Everyone cheers]
   Man: It's the "I didn't do it" guy!
         [Krusty looks shocked]
Krusty: He's mine!  [grabs Bart] I own him and all his subsidiary
        rights!
-- A sudden change of heart, 

[End of Act Two.  Time: 13:33]

A screen introduces "The 'I Didn't Do It' Boy In: The Ming Vase On
Ladder Sketch", showing a picture of a smiling Bart.  Krusty says, "Why,
this rickety ladder in front of this door is the _perfect_ place for
this priceless Ming vase."  He then steps back, pointing at the vase and
grinning.  Bart walks in, knocking the ladder over and smashing the
vase.  "I didn't do it," he says, and the audience laugh and cheer.
"Thank you, thank you," says Krusty, then introducing "the 'I Didn't Do
It' Dancers!"  Four women begin dancing to a techno-pop song.

Apu is watching the show on a TV in the Kwik-E-Mart, but he's being held
up by Snake.

Snake: Don't move, dude.  This is totally a gun.
        [Apu presses the alarm button quickly]
        [Snake cocks the shotgun and points it at Apu]
  Apu: I didn't do it!
        [Both laugh helplessly]
-- Important hold-up strategies, 

Diamond Joe Quimby lies in bed with a woman, giggling.  His wife opens
the door, and the woman screams.  "Joe, how could you?" she asks, hurt,
and Joe says, "I, er, didn't do it."  The three of them begin to laugh.

{In a burning building, a man cries for help from the fourth floor.  A
fireman rues, "This is the third time this building has burned down
because someone has been smoking in bed."  Patty and Selma, slightly
charred, chime in guiltily, "I didn't do it," and everyone laughs, even
the man who's life is in danger.}

At breakfast the next day, everyone holds "I Didn't Do It: the Bart
Simpson Story."

 Lisa: This biography of Bart came out awfully quickly.  It's not even
       about him!
 Bart: Sure it is!  Look at the cover.
 Lisa: But inside it's mostly about Ross Perot, and the last two
       chapters are excerpts from the Oliver North trial.
Homer: Ah, Oliver North.  He was just _poured_ into that uniform.
-- That's _Senator_ Oliver North, almost, 

In the recording studio, the background to Rick James' "Superfreak"
plays, and Bart raps "I didn't do it" a la Hammer.  The latter watches
from the control room, and he says, "Hey, proper," with admiration.
Bart's "I Didn't Do It III" album comes out, and it sells very quickly.

Krusty even organizes a "See the 'I Didn't Do It' Boy" event where, for
a mere five dollars, one gets to go in a tent and see Bart sitting on a
chair.

I have to pay to see my own grandson.  That's the Democrats for ya.
-- Abe, fierce Republican, 

Krusty: See the boy, five dollars, or call him, twenty-four hours a day,
        on "BartChat".
         [A little girl dials "BartChat"]
Barney: BartChat.
  Girl: Are you Bart?
Barney: Sure I am.  I didn't do nothin'.
  Girl: Uh, isn't it, I didn't do _it_?
Barney: Yeah, whatever.  [burps]
-- Details, 

In fourth grade, the entire class stares at Bart, grinning silently.
Even Mrs. Krabappel does so.

    Bart: Uh...I never thought I'd say this, but shouldn't we be
          learning something?
Milhouse: Say the line, Bart!
    Bart: [sighs] I didn't do it.
Everyone: Yay!
-- The price of education, 

Homer: Come on, Lisa, say something funny.
        [holds a tape recorded with a microphone]
 Lisa: Like what?
Homer: Oh, something stupid like Bart would say.  "Bucka Bucka" or
       "Woozle Wuzzle": something like that.
 Lisa: Forget it, Dad.  If I ever become famous, I want it to be for
       something worthwhile, not because of some obnoxious fad.
 Bart: Obnoxious fad?
Homer: Aw, don't worry, son.  You know, they said the same thing about
       Urkel, a -- that little snot boy!  I'd like to smash that kid!
-- Homer's temper flares, 

At the kitchen table, Bart sits with a stack of books surrounding him.

Homer: What the hell are you reading books for?
 Bart: I'm doing "The Conan O'Brien Show", and I want to have some
       intelligent stuff to talk about.
Homer: Don't forget to say "I didn't do it."
 Bart: Dad, there's more to me than just a catch-phrase.
Homer: How do you figure, boy?
 Bart: Watch "The Conan O'Brien Show", you'll see.
Homer: All right, but after Leno I'm all laughed out, you know.
-- 

On "Late Night with Conan O'Brien", Bart tries to talk to the host.

 Bart: You know, Conan, I have a lot to say.  I'm not just a one-line
       wonder.  Did you know that a section of rain forest the size of
       Kansas is burned every single --
Conan: Just do the line.
 Bart: [glum] I didn't do it.
        [Everyone laughs and cheers]
Conan: [laughs] Great material.  We'll be right back.
        [Music starts, and Conan dances.  Bart half-heartedly joins him]
       Sit perfectly still: only I may dance!
-- Deprived, 

Bart lies on his bed after the show, muttering.

     Bart: "Just do the line", "Just do the line"...what's going to
           happen to me?
            [He imagines the future set of "The Match Game"]
Announcer: And now it's time for "Match Game 2034", with Billy Crystal!
    Billy: Hi!
Announcer: Farah Fawcett-Majors-O'Neal-Varney!
    Farah: [grunts]
Announcer: The "I didn't do it" boy!
     Bart: [grunts]
Announcer: Ventriloquist Loni Anderson!
     Loni: [sighs]
Announcer: Spike Lee!
    Spike: Mmm.
Announcer: And the always lovely and vivacious head of Kitty Carlisle!
    Kitty: Hi, everybody: let's start the game!
-- Worse than "Let's Make A Deal", 

Bart imagines Kitty hissing at him, and him being frightened and
knocking her glass ball onto the floor.  It shatters, sending her head
rolling away.  He screams in the fantasy _and_ in real life.

 Marge: [knocking] Bart?  It's time to get ready for the show.
  Bart: Nooo!  [blocks his door]
Krusty: Where is that little punk?  We go on in ten minutes.  Oh, the
        tension.  Somebody!  Walk on my back.
         [Everyone stops, looks at the prone klown]
         [They all run over to walk on him]
        Ow!  Ow!  One at a time!  No teamsters.
-- Popularity problems, 

Marge tries to console her son.

Marge: Honey, I know you feel a little silly saying the same four words
       over and over, but you shouldn't.  You're making people happy,
       and that's a very hard thing to do.
 Bart: You're right, Mom.  I shouldn't let this bother me.  I'm in
       television now.  It's my job to be repetitive.  My job.  My job.
       Repetitiveness is my job.  I am going to go out there tonight and
       give the _best_ performance of my life.
Marge: The _best_ performance of your life?
 Bart: The _best_ performance of my life!
-- What was that again?, 

Krusty is still nervous as he awaits Bart's arrival.

Krusty: Where is that lousy little pisher -- [Bart walks in]
         [joyfully] Bart!  [kisses him]
         [On stage, a fanfare plays]
        And now, boys and girls, here he is, the boy that says the words
        you've been longing to hear, like the salivating dogs that you
        are, Bart Simpson!
-- Did someone ring a bell?, 

Bart struts out and says, "I didn't do it."  One woman chuckles, and a
man clears his throat.  Bart repeats himself, but only the crickets
chirp.  He looks over at Krusty, but he's no help: he simply shrugs.
Bart tries another line: "Woozle Wuzzle?"  Everyone repeats it to
themselves, and a man asks, "That's what passes for entertainment these
days?  Woozle Wuzzle?"  Everyone gets up to leave, and an announcer
says, "Ladies and Gentlemen, the Klown Show has been put on hiatus for
retooling."

  Bart: What happened?
Krusty: Aw, don't worry about that.  You're just finished, that's all.
  Bart: Finished?
Krusty: Ehh, it happens all the time.  That's show business for you: one
        day you're the most important guy that ever lived, the next day
        you're some shmoe working in a box factory.
 Guide: I heard that.
  Bart: Boy.  Show business is kind of cruel, isn't it?
         [Krusty slams and locks the exit, leaving Bart outside]
-- You _could_ say that, yes, 

Bart walks home alone.  As he passes a taxi, he hears KBBL.

Marty: That was "Kung Fu Fighting".  Say, speaking of one-trick ponies,
       whatever happened to that "I didn't do it" kid?
 Bill: Boy, did _that_ get old fast.  Whoa!  You know, if you want to
       last in this business, you've gotta stay fresh!
        [a slide-whistle and clown horn play]
-- 

At home, Marge hauls up a box of Bart paraphernalia.  She explains she
saved them for Bart to remind him of the time when he was the whole
world's special little guy.  Bart thanks her.

    Lisa: And now you can go back to just being you, instead of a one-
          dimensional character with a silly catch-phrase.
   Homer: [breaks a lamp] D'oh!
    Bart: Ay, caramba!
   Marge: Mmm.
  Maggie: [sucks her pacifier]
Flanders: Heidely-ho.
  Barney: [burps]
  Nelson: Ha, ha!
   Burns: Ex-cellent!
           [Everyone looks at Lisa]
    Lisa: [unimpressed] If anyone wants me, I'll be in my room.
-- Three-dimensional Lisa, 

[End of Act Three.  Time: 20:56]

Over the credits, Homer asks, "What kind of catch-phrase is that?"
 EPISODE TITLE: Homer and Apu


EPISODE SUMMARY: 
[Syndication cuts are marked in curly braces "{}" and are courtesy of
Ricardo Lafaurie and Frederic Briere.]

Apu handles the customers in his customary fashion at the Kwik-E-Mart.

 Man 1: I need one 29-cent stamp.
   Apu: That's $1.85.
 Man 2: I'll have $2.00 worth of gas, please.
   Apu: $4.20.
Martin: How much is your penny candy?
   Apu: [cheerful] Surprisingly expensive!
-- Apu the cheerful convenience store employee, 

The customers mutter to themselves and walk out, disgruntled.  One of
the customers grabs a Twinkie on the way out and twists it up
vengefully, exclaiming "This is what I think of your store!"  He throws
it on the floor in disgust and walks out.  "Silly customer!"  Apu calls
after him, "You cannot hurt a Twinkie."  He picks it up and it pops back
into shape.  Satisfied, Apu puts it back.

He notices a smell somewhere, and he sniffs over to its source: a bag of
ham saying, "Exp.  Feb. 6, 1989".

  Apu: Jiminy Cricket!  Wooh, expired ham.  [scribbles over the expiry
       date]
       Oh, this time I have gone to far.  No, no one will fall for --
Homer: Woo hoo!  Cheap meat!  [picks it up] Ooh, this one's open.
       [starts eating it]
-- No ham too rancid, 

At home on the couch, Homer continues devouring the expired ham, but his
stomach begins to rebel.

[eats ham, but his stomach groans]
Stomach...churning!
 [eats some more]
Bowels...clenching!  Not much time...must...finish...[eats some more]
-- Homer battles the expired ham, 

The ambulance rushes him to the hospital.

Hibbert: Well, sir, Homer's illness was either caused by ingesting
         spoiled food, or, heh heh, some sort of voodoo curse.
  Patty: Hey: we've just been working the eyes.  [holds up a Homer doll
         with pins in the eyes]
-- That explains the poor vision, 

Incensed, Homer returns to the Kwik-E-Mart to have it out with Apu.

Homer: Your old meat made me sick!
  Apu: Oh, I'm so sorry.  [gets a pail of shrimp] Please accept five
       pounds of frozen shrimp?
Homer: [holds one up, sniffs it] This shrimp isn't frozen!  And it
       smells funny.
  Apu: OK, ten pounds.
Homer: Woo hoo!
-- No shrimp too thawed, 

Once again, the ambulance takes him to the hospital.  Back at home,
Homer lies on the couch while Lisa and he watch "Bite Back with Kent
Brockman".  Each word of the title screen appears from the mouth of a
barking dog in a detective uniform.  Even the sponsor's name is barked
out after a man says, "Brought to you by...".  Homer comments with
admiration, "That dog can sell anything."

Good evening.  Here's an update on last week's nursing home expose,
"Geezers in Freezers."  It turns out the rest home _was_ adequately
heated; the footage you saw was of a fur-storage facility.  We've also
been told to apologize for using the term "geezer."
Now, coming up next, the case of the cantankerous old geezer.
-- Kent Brockman on "Bite Back", 

Just then, Homer's stomach groans.

Homer: Oh, rancid meat attack!  Stupid parasites.  Is there no way I can
       find justice?
 Kent: If you have a consumer complaint, just call this number --
Homer: Boring.
 Lisa: Dad, you should blow the whistle on the Kwik-E-Mart.
 Kent: And now a message from the Church of Latter-Day Saints.  [dog
       barks repeatedly]
 Lisa: Dad, are you listening to me?
Homer: Shh, Lisa: the dog is barking.
-- Anything, indeed, 

That night, at the channel six studios, Kent Brockman talks to Homer.

 Kent: All right, are you willing to go undercover to nail this creep?
Homer: No way, man.  No way, man!  Get yourself another patsy, man.  No
       way am I wearing a freakin' wire!
 Kent: {All right, all right, all right.}  Would you be willing to wear
       a hidden camera and microphone?
Homer: Oh, that I'll wear.
-- _Much_ safer, 

The next day, Kent and Homer are inside a van labeled "Ordinary Van"
parked outside the Kwik-E-Mart.

Kent: We've come up with a camera so tiny it fits into this oversized
      novelty hat.
       [Homer puts it on, and struggles to stand upright]
      Now, go get us some incriminating footage, and remember: you have
      to get in and out in ten minutes, or you'll suffer permanent neck
      damage.
 Man: [neck horribly twisted] He's not kidding.
-- Moving in for the kill, 

Homer walks towards the Kwik-E-Mart doors, swaying and weaving.  Apu
watches him, curious.  {Two seconds of the swaying and weaving are cut
in syndication.}

  Apu: Huh?
Homer: Don't be alarmed, Apu.  Just go about your daily routine like I'm
       not wearing the hat.
  Apu: Your headgear seems to be emitting a buzzing noise, sir.  Perhaps
       you have a bee in your bonnet?
Homer: Bee?  Aah!  [stomps on hat, runs out]
 Kent: Homer, that hat's been with the station twenty years!  He had one
       day left till retirement.
-- A sad day for Channel Six, 

But the camera inside the hat still works.  It is pointed at Apu.

  Apu: Well, time to replenish the hot dog roller.  La, la -- oops
       [drops a hot dog] Oh, no -- it is encrusted with filth.  [blows
       it off] Oh well, let's sell it anyway.  Now this is just between
       me and you...smashed hat.  Hee hee --
 Kent: Hot diggety-dog, we've got him, Mr. Simpson.  Now let's -- Mr.
       Simpson?
Homer: One hot dog, please.
-- No hot dog too encrusted, 

Kent Brockman interviews Apu for "Bite Back," and Apu shows the
videotape to some customers.

       [on "Bite Back"]
 Kent: Apu, will you ever stop selling spoiled meat?
  Apu: No -- I mean, yes -- I mean -- uh oh.  [sweats]
        [Apu turns off the TV]
       I think I come off very well.
Woman: Monster!  Run, children.
-- 

The interview has made the rounds at Kwik-E-Mart HQ, apparently.  A man
walks through the door, flanked by two bodyguards.

Inspector: Apu Nahasapeemapetilan, you have disgraced the Kwik-E-Mart
           Corporation.
      Apu: But, sir, I was only following standard procedure.
Inspector: Ah, true.  But it's _also_ standard procedure to blame any
           problems on a scapegoat or sacrificial lamb.
      Apu: Uh huh, and if I can obtain for you these animals?
Inspector: I'm sorry, Apu: I have no choice.  You can no longer wear
           this name patch.  [tears it off]
      Apu: [gasps]
Inspector: And you can no longer tell people about our fried pickles.
           [tears off the patch]
           Now: turn in your pricing gun.
           {[Apu removes it from a shoulder holster]}
           {[severe] The other one too.}
            [Apu removes it from an ankle holster]
      Apu: [sighs] Fired...after all these years of loyal service.
           [picks up a hot dog] I don't want to live any more.
Inspector: [grabs him] Give me that weiner --
      Apu: I don't want to live, sir!
Inspector: Give me that weiner --
      Apu: Don't --
Inspector: No, Apu, it's not worth it!
-- The biggest moment of Apu's life, 

Apu wanders the streets of Springfield, depressed and alone.

Apu: What do I do now?  I have been drummed out of my profession.  I'm a
     disgrace!  Even this babbling brook sounds almost like mocking
     laughter.
      [laughter is coming from under the bridge where two bums tickle
     each other with feathers]
Bum: Who needs money when we got feathers?
-- A new aphorism, perhaps?, 

Apu walks past a store window advertising, "Today Only -- Laughing
Monkeys."  The four monkeys see him approach, and they all begin to
laugh and point.

His wanderings take him to Evergreen Terrace.  As he meanders down the
sidewalk, a thunderstorm begins.  "This is all because of Homer
Simpson!" our Hindu friend rues.  Funny he should mention Homer -- at
that very moment, Homer watches "Evening at the Improv" where a black
comedian is doing his routine.

Comedian: Yo, check this out: black guys drive a car like this.
           [Leans back, as though his elbow were on the windowsill]
          Do, do, ch.  Do-be-do, do-be-do-be-do.
          Yeah, but white guys, see, they drive a car like this.
           [Hunches forward, talks nasally]
          Dee-da-dee, a-dee-da-dee-da-dee-da-dee.
           [Audience howls with laughter]
   Homer: Ah ha ha, it's true, it's true!  We're so lame!
-- Homer's humility, 

Apu says threateningly, "It is time to settle the score!"  He walks up
to the door and knocks.  Homer answers it, and Apu walks slowly towards
him, arms outstretched, an angry scowl on his features.  Homer walks
backwards, and screams in fright.

[End of Act One.  Time: 6:23]

Homer begs for mercy.

Homer: No, don't kill me.  I didn't know there was film in that camera
       in that hat!  I was unaware.  I was unaware!  [sobs]
  Apu: Mr. Simpson, you misunderstand me.  In my village this is the
       traditional pose of apology.
Homer: Oh.
  Apu: You know, now that I think about it, it may be a little
       confusing.  Many have died needlessly.
-- The price of tradition, 

Apu reveals the true purpose of his visit.

  Apu: I have come to make amends, sir.  At first, I blamed you for
       squealing, but then I realized, it was _I_ who wronged _you_.  So
       I have come to work off my debt.  I am at your service.
Homer: You're...selling _what_, now?
  Apu: I am selling only the concept of karmic realignment.
Homer: You can't sell that!  Karma can only be portioned out by the
       cosmos.  [slams the door]
  Apu: He's got me there.
-- Homer teaches about karma, 

The next day, the family watch as Apu works in the yard outside.  Homer
walks down the stairs.

Homer: [annoyed] Is he still out there?
Marge: Yes.  He's raking leaves?
Homer: What?  That's _your_ job.  If he starts doing Lisa's wood
       chopping --
Marge: If he wants to make it up to you so badly I think you should let
       him.
Homer: OK, OK, I'll let him.  But then I get a Chipwich, OK?
-- Homer, master delegator, 

As part of his debt repayment, Apu decides to cook dinner.

  Apu: It is an honor to begin repaying my debt to you.  Back in
       Ramatpur I was considered quite the gourmet.
Marge: [sniffs her food] Mmm, it certainly is exotic.  [looks up] Ooh,
       Lisa -- is that too spicy for you?
 Lisa: [breathless] I can see through time!
Homer: [stuffing his face] Stop being such babies.  You can't be afraid
       to try new things.  For instance, tonight I'm using a...Apu, what
       do you call this thing again?
  Apu: A "napkin".
Homer: Ha ha ha ha!  Outrageous!
-- First time for everything, 

[In 3F31, we see a scene that was cut from the original airing of this
episode.  It was probably meant to go somewhere in Act Two.  Transcript
courtesy of Frederic Briere.]

  Apu: I'm hoping you enjoy this movie.  It made every Indian critic's
       top 400 list.
Woman: [singing] Love love love love love!  I'm in love with lovely
       Johnny.
        [an Indian man breaks through a window and curses in Hindi at
       three sitting men]
        [they all start dancing]
 Bart: This movie you rented sucks.
Homer: No it doesn't, it's funny!  Their clothes are different from my
       clothes.  [laughs] Look at what they're wearing!  [laughs more]
-- 

[End of cut scene.]

The inspector and another woman are conducting interviews for Apu's
replacement.

Inspector: All right, why do you want to become part of the Kwik-E-Mart
           family?
   Barney: Because I like people.  And I need a place where I'll be out
           of the sun.
    Woman: Thank you.
   Barney: [burps]
Inspector: Hmm...he's head and shoulders above everyone else.
-- At beer-drinking, perhaps, 

Just before they hire Barney, the woman points out there's one more
applicant.

Inspector: Name?
    Woods: James Woods, heh.
    Woman: Previous job experience?
    Woods: Ooh, uh, let's see, "True Believer", uh, "Salvador", "Onion
           Field", uh -- "The Hard Way"?
Inspector: Wait, wait a minute.  Those aren't convenience stores!  That
           sounds more like the resume of a Hollywood movie star.
    Woods: [chuckles] You know, er.
 Together: [gasp] James Woods!
-- That's what he said, 

    Woman: Why would you want to work at a Kwik-E-Mart?
    Woods: To be honest, in my upcoming movie I'm going to be playing
           this tightly-wound convenience store clerk and, I kind of
           like to research my roles and really get into it.
           For instance, "True Believer"?  I actually worked in a law
           firm for two months.  And then, the film "Chaplin"?  I had a
           little cameo in that.  I actually _traveled_ in time, back to
           the twenties, where -- oh, heh, I've said too much.
Inspector: Welcome aboard.
-- "Back to the Future" wannabe James Woods, 

{At home, Homer hums in the shower.  He turns off the water and reaches
for his towel, but he can't find where it is.}

  Apu: {[holds out a towel] Good morning, sir!}
Homer: {Aah!}
  Apu: {Relax, please.  You do not have anything I have not seen before.
       [sees something on Homer's chest] What is...?}
Homer: {[sheepish] Er...I...like to keep a lollipop there.}
-- For emergencies only, 

Apu stacks some cans of corn on the kitchen counter.  Marge looks on.

Marge: Hmm.  Apu, we usually store our cans in the cupboard.
  Apu: Oh, they'll never move that way.
 Lisa: Mmm, corn!  Haven't had that in a while.
 Bart: Yeah, delicious corn.
-- Corn-selling strategy 101, 

Marge: [checks the fridge] Oh, we're low on milk for Maggie.  You want
       to come with me to the Kwik-E-Mart?
  Apu: [knocking over cans] Please, Mrs. Simpson, I -- I cannot go
       there.  That is the scene of my spiritual de-pantsing.
-- Not the de-pantsing!, 

Marge suggests they go to the new Monstro Mart ("Where Shopping Is a
Baffling Ordeal") The two of them walk down the aisle, with shelves
stacked high with huge drums of everything.

   Marge: Ooh, that's a _great_ price for twelve pounds of nutmeg.
     Apu: Oh, great selection and rock-bottom prices.  But where is the
          love?
     Man: [over loudspeaker] Attention, Monstro Mart shoppers: just a
          reminder that we love each and every one of you.
Everyone: Aw.
     Apu: [impressed] Hmph.
-- Plug for the Monstro Mart, 

Barney approaches some giant woman-shaped bottles of syrup.  "Excuse me,
ma'am," he asks, "Where are the lampshades?"  When she doesn't answer,
he rocks the bottle, "Ma'am?"  It topples over, spilling syrup out of
her head with a glugging noise.  "Oh, I've killed her!"  Barney laments,
"It's all happening again!"  He runs off crying, straight into a stack
of cranberry juice bottles.  They smash to the floor, creating a giant
wave of red.  Barney runs away from it as it splashes down the aisle
where Apu and Marge stand.  Barney gets swamped, as does another
customer who can't swim.  "Help me, help me!" he cries, going under for
the third time, but he reaches out and grabs a floating bottle, and as
he comes up for air, he licks his lips.  "Mmm...it's cran-tastic!"

Apu and Marge wait at the back of the long line in the express lane.

Apu: Mrs. Simpson, the express line is the fastest line not always.
     That old man up front, he is starved for attention.  He will talk
     the cashier's head off.
Abe: {Ah, there's an interesting story behind this nickel.  In 1957, I
     remember it was, I got up in the morning and made myself a piece of
     toast.  I set the toaster to three -- medium brown.}
-- Then he tied an onion to his belt, 

  Apu: Let's go to...that line.
Marge: But that's the longest.
  Apu: Yes, but look: all pathetic single men.  Only cash, no chitchat.
-- Axioms of shopping lines, 

Marge smiles approvingly as the line moves much faster.

James Woods, meanwhile, practices his new job.

Woods: 75, 85, 90, and a dollar.  Thank you, and come again.  Hey, wait
       a minute!  Hey!  Uh...could I just ask you a question?  Did
       you...did you _believe_ that, the way I gave you the change?  Did
       I sound like a _real_ Kwik-E-Mart, you know, kind of guy?
Jimbo: Actually, I thought it was a little labored.
Woods: Oh.
Jimbo: You've got to lose yourself in the moment, man!
Woods: Yeah, like, yeah, OK, great!  OK, let's, let's just try that
       again, OK?  Come on.  Hey, come on -- hey!  Get over here.  OK,
       now you're you, I'm me.
Jimbo: [with trepidation] I'm me?
Woods: [grabs his collar] Hey -- don't..._jerk_ me around, fella.
-- Not to be toyed with., 

The whole Simpson family loves Apu's food now, and they chow down
greedily.  "Pass the chutney," Homer says through a mouthful.

Marge: Apu, you've been so helpful.  If it weren't for him, we'd still
       be in line at the Monstro Mart!
 Lisa: And he taught me how to play the Sheh'nai.  [plays a snake-
       charmers instrument]
Homer: [shudders] That's even worse than the album Grampa released.
 Bart: And he taught me how to do this.  [puts both legs behind his
       head] I got out of school because I told them I was mangled in a
       car wreck.
-- A believable excuse, 

  Apu: Thank you all for the kind praise.
Homer: Well, you deserve it.  All these vegetables are really clearing
       the cholesterol out of the old heart.
        [A lump of cholesterol leaves Homer's heart and travels to his
       brain]
        [monotonically] Uh, Apu friend me good.
-- Brain short circuits, 

Lisa translates for Homer, telling Apu that he's like a member of the
family now.  Apu says he feels that way too.

  Apu: You see, whether igloo hut, or lean-to, or a geodesic dome,
       There's no structure I have been to, which I'd rather call my
       home.
       
       When I first arrived, you were all such jerks,
       But now I've come to looooooove your quirks.
       
       Maggie with her eyes so bright,
       Marge with hair by Frank Lloyd Wright,
       Lisa can philosophize, Bart's adept at spinning lies,
       Homer's a delightful fella, sorry about the salmonella.
Homer: [Heh heh, that's OK.]
       
  Apu: Who needs the Kwik-E-Mart?
       Now here comes the tricky part.
       Oh, won't you rhyme with me?
       Who needs the Kwik-E-Mart?
Marge: Their floors are Stick-E-Mart,
 Lisa: They make Dad Sick-E-Mart,
 Bart: Let's hurl a Brick-E-Mart,
Homer: The Kwik-E-Mart is real...[D'oh!]
       
  Apu: Who needs the Kwik-E-Mart?
       Not meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee...[held for next three lines]
  OFF: Forget the Kwik-E-Mart,
       Goodbye to Kwik-E-Mart,
       Who needs Kwik-E-mart?
  Apu: Not me.
-- The Kwik-E-Mart song, 

Homer: Everything _really_ wrapped up nicely.  [checks his watch] Ooh,
       much quicker than usual.
Marge: I guess we've learned that happiness is wherever you find it.
Homer: And we've _all_ found happiness, every one of us.
        [Apu sobs in the background]
       Hey, what's that sound?
        [outside, they see Apu on the roof]
  Apu: [singing folornly] Who needs the Kwik-E-Mart?  I do.
Homer: {Hey, he's not happy at all.  He lied to us through song.  I
       _hate_ when people do that!}
-- Damn you, feeble song, 

[End of Act Two.  Time: 14:30]

Apu confesses his true feelings.

  Apu: I can't lie to myself, you know.  I _do_ miss my Kwik-E-Mart.
 Lisa: Isn't there _anything_ you can do to get your job back?
  Apu: I must go to the head office and appeal my case.
Homer: I'm coming with you.  I got you fired; it's the least I can do.
       Well, the least I can do is absolutely nothing, but I'll go you
       one better and come along!
  Apu: But, sir, the head office is in India.
Homer: OK.
 Lisa: Dad, that's over ten thousand miles away.
Homer: I'm aware of that!
 Lisa: That's over sixteen thousand kilometers!
Homer: D'oh!
-- Here comes the metric system, indeed, 

Apu and Homer ride off on mules, with their things strapped to the
mules' backs.  Well, actually, they just ride off to the Springfield
airport.  "I'm sorry we couldn't take a cab, but I spent my last dollar
on the plane tickets," Apu explains.

{As they fly over the mountains, Homer pesters Apu.}

Homer: {Are we in India yet?}
  Apu: {No.}
Homer: {Are we in India yet?}
  Apu: {No.}
Homer: {Are we in India yet?}
  Apu: {No.}
Homer: {Are we in India yet?}
  Apu: {No.  Oh, wait...now we are.}
-- The plane trip to India, 

James Woods cleans out the microwave with a scraper while talking on his
cellular phone.

Tony, you're my agent.  You _have_ to do something about this.  ...How
can it be the same movie if they've changed my character from a
convenience store clerk to a jittery eskimo firefighter?  ...Uh huh...uh
huh...mm hmm...well, actually, that's a pretty good explanation.  {Now
this is gross, right, this'll be _gross_ points in this new...?  OK.
Yeah, 'cause there's monkey -- yeah, OK, great.}
OK, good: book me a flight, rent me an igloo, and tell those dorks at
the Kwik-E-Mart that boom!  I am outta here, I'm a dot, I'm gone, OK?
...What do you mean, I gotta give two weeks' notice?  Why you frickin',
no good, motha [beep] [beep] cheese!  ...No, not you, I'm just talking
to my oven.
-- James Woods' frustrations, 

At the airport, a bunch of people in suits sing, "If you're saved and
you know it, clap your hands," at the arriving passengers, some of whom
are Hare Krishnas.  "Oh, great -- Christians," one of them says.

 hold precariously onto the outside of a train.  "Attention
passengers," the conductor announces, "dinner is now being served on the
dining car."  Everyone inches their way towards the back of the train.

Our heroes' journey continues along a plain and up a mountain path.  As
they near the top, they are unshaven and disheveled.

  Apu: There she is: the world's first convenience store!  [points to
       store on top of mountain]
Homer: This isn't very convenient.
  Apu: Must you dump on everything we do?
-- Well, yes, actually, 

They walk up to the sliding doors.  A bell dings as they enter and
approach a man with white hair and a flowing white beard.  He drinks a
Squishee, and a sign behind him announces, "The Master Knows All (except
combination to safe)."

   Apu: He is the benevolent and enlightened president and C.E.O. of
        Kwik-E-Mart -- and in Ohio, Stop-O-Mart.  He is the one we must
        ask for my job back.
Master: Approach, my sons.  [they do] You may ask me three questions.
   Apu: That's great, because all I need is one --
 Homer: Are you _really_ the head of the Kwik-E-Mart?
Master: Yes.
 Homer: Really?
Master: Yes.
 Homer: You?
Master: Yes.  I hope this has been enlightening for you.
   Apu: But I must --
Master: Thank you, come again.
   Apu: But --
Master: Thank you, come again.
-- The master speaks, 

The two of them leave, disappointed.

Homer: Well, _that_ was a big bust.  Is he _really_ the head of the
       Kwik-E-Mart?
  Apu: [growls, reaches towards Homer]
Homer: No need to apologize, Apu: it was as much my fault as it was
       yours.
  Apu: [grabs Homer by the throat and squeezes]
Homer: OK, Apu: I accept your apology!
-- Confusion reigns supreme, 

They tumble off the side of the mountain together.

Arriving home, the men are greeted by the rest of the Simpson family.

Bart+Lisa: Dad, dad!  What did you bring?  What did you bring?
    Marge: How did it go?
    Homer: Fine!  [looks at Apu] Oh, I mean not good.
     Lisa: I'm sorry, Apu.  But remember, [sings] "Who needs the Kwik-E-
           Mart?"
      Apu: Would you mind?  I'm not in the mood.
-- Disappointment, 

Apu, if it'll make you feel any better, I've learned that life is one
crushing defeat after another until you just wish Flanders was dead!
-- Homer comforts Apu, 

Apu agrees, he's got to accept his fate after having feared it for long
enough.

  Apu: I've got to go down to the Kwik-E-Mart and I'm going to face my
       demon.
Marge: Oh, that'll work out great!  We're out of Lucky Charms.
-- Dual-purpose visit, 

Apu walks off with determination.  He walks into the store.

  Apu: Ah, my old Squishee machine.  And my scum bucket with fly!  And a
       whole check list.
Woods: Hey, you're Apu Nahasapeemapetilon, aren't you?  I mean, you're
       the -- you're like _the_ guy, you're a legend around here.  Can I
       ask you, is it true you once worked 96 hours straight?
  Apu: Oh yes, it was horrible I tell you.  By the end I thought I was a
       hummingbird of some kind.
Woods: Oh yeah, you know, I studied your old security tapes.
        [On tape, Apu imitates a hummingbird, flying back and forth
       across the screen and emitting a high-pitched humming noise]
  Apu: In a few minutes, I tried to drink nectar out of Sanjay's head.
-- Nectar without cholesterol, that is, 

Just then, a burly man walks in brandishing a gun.

Robber: All right, you.  Hand over the cash and don't try any funny
        stuff.
 Woods: Hey, pal, I assure you: if I tried any funny stuff, _you_ would
        be in hysterics.
-- Disarming comebacks, 

The robber recognizes James Woods, and tells him his new song is going
to be number three with a bullet.  "I'm not a singer," Woods protests,
and the robber yells "Shut up!" and cocks the gun.  Apu sees what is
about to happen, and he yells "No!" while jumping in front of Woods.

Woods: Apu!
  Apu: Oh, the searing kiss of hot lead.  How I've missed you!  I mean
       -- I think I'm dying.
-- 

At the hospital, Dr. Hibbert explains how lucky Apu is.  "You see, the
bullet ricocheted off another bullet that was lodged in your chest from
a previous robbery."

Woods: Apu, you saved my life.  And as a small token of my appreciation,
       I got you your job back at the Kwik-E-Mart.
  Apu: Oh...oh, Mr. Woods, your --
Woods: But as for me, I'm off to battle aliens on a faraway planet.
Marge: That sounds like a good movie.
Woods: Yes...yes, a...a movie, yes.
-- James Woods departs in peace, 

Homer: Hey, let's all hug Apu.
        [They all do, then there's a pause]
        [Homer looks at his watch] Hey, there's still time: let's hug
       him again!
-- Metahumor, 

[End of Act Three.  Time: 20:51]
 EPISODE TITLE: Lisa vs. Malibu Stacy


EPISODE SUMMARY: 
[Syndication cuts are marked in curly braces "{}" and are courtesy of
Ricardo Lafaurie.]

Dr. Hibbert delivers a speech at the opening of the Springfield Center
for Geriatric Medicine.

Hibbert: Er, welcome to the new Springfield Center for Geriatric
         Medicine.  You know, health care for the aging is an important
         priority in this --
    Abe: Get to Matlock!  Maaatlooock!
Hibbert: Well, uh, ahem, without further ado, heh heh, I give you the
         man who puts young people behind bars -- where they belong.
         TV's Matlock!
          [An old man with two canes walks slowly onto the stage]
  Crowd: [singing] We love you Matlock, oh yes we do...
-- Matlock: Hero of the Aged, 

In their excitement, the crowd turns violent and rushes the stage,
knocking poor Matlock over and tugging cruelly at his collar, tearing
it.  Someone even puts their cane around his throat.

On the way back to the Springfield Retirement Castle, Abe seems quiet.

Jasper: What's eatin' you, Abe?  For three weeks all you've been talking
        about is meeting Matlock.  Now you've met him, swiped his pills
        -- [reads label] "Take one every hour to prevent spastic heart
        convulsions" --
         [An ambulance drives by with its siren blaring; inside a doctor
        uses cardiac stimulator, yelling "Clear!"]
        -- but you ain't said a word.
   Abe: Looking at that tired old freak has made me realize I'm no
        spring chicken myself.  I can feel death's clammy hand on my
        shoulder...wait, that's my hand.
-- 

In the next scene, the Simpson family is seated in front of Grampa at
their house.

 Abe: Hello.  As you may know, I might not be around much longer.  So,
      I've decided to give you your inheritance before I die.  That way
      I can see you enjoy it.
      Lisa, I know you like reading and...so forth.  To you, I give you
      my lifetime of personal correspondence.
Lisa: Thanks.  [reads] "Mr. Simpson stop Your calls and letters are
      becoming nuisance stop If you do not cease I will be forced to
      pursue legal action stop Signed Boris Karloff, Hollywood,
      California."
-- A persistent fan, 

  Abe: And to my son Homer --
Homer: Woo-hoo!
  Abe: -- and his entire family --
Homer: D'oh!
  Abe: -- I leave these: a box of mint-condition 1918 liberty-head
       silver dollars.  You see, back in those days, rich men would ride
       around in Zeppelins, dropping coins on people, and one day I seen
       J. D. Rockefeller flying by.  So I run of the house with a big
       washtub and -- [notices everyone ready to leave] where are you
       going?
Homer: Dad, we'd love to stay here and listen to your amusing antidote,
       but we have to take these coins to the mall and spend 'em!
-- Priority one, 

Abe's pointless story continues in the car ride to the mall.

Abe: Anyway, about my washtub...I just used it that morning to wash my
     turkey, which in those days was known as a "walking bird".  We'd
     always have walking bird on Thanksgiving with all the trimmings:
     cranberries, injun eyes, yams stuffed with gunpowder.  Then we'd
     all watch football, which in those days was called "baseball"...
-- Onions for everyone's belt, 

They go to a toy store in the mall, and Maggie resourcefully uses an
Etch-A-Sketch[tm] to write her name.  Homer walks over and
uncerimoniously puts another toy on top of the Etch-A-Sketch.

Homer: Look, Maggie!  It's Sergeant Thug's Mountaintop Command Post!
       Complete with "DeathBringer Missiles" that really launch.
Marge: Mmm...that toy isn't safe for a baby like Maggie!
Homer: Aw, come on, Marge, you're way too -- [cuts his finger on it]
       D'oh!  Aw -- [gets electrocuted] Aah!  [launches a missile into
       his mouth] ooh -- [it explodes]
-- A closed mouth gathers no feet, 

Abe, meanwhile, inspects some of the other merchandise.

  Abe: When I was young, toys were built to last.  Look at this junk!
       [holds a toy rocket] It breaks the first time you take it out of
       the box.
        [He strains, then manages to break it in half]
       And look at these toy soldiers -- they'll break the second I step
       on 'em.  [stomps on em] Arg!  Stupid!  Toy!  Soldiers!  Break,
       you stupid --
        [Two security guards grab him]
Guard: All right, come on, Pops.  Soldiers won't bother you any more.
-- Reliving days of pain, 

{As Homer walks to another section of the store, he hears a single note.
He looks down and sees a keyboard on the floor with giant keys that
light up and play a sound when you step on them.  Tentatively, he steps
on another key, and then gets an idea.}

{"One, two, three o'clock, four o'clock, rock!  Five, six, seven
o'clock, eight o'clock, rock!  Rock, rock, rock --" he sings off-key, at
first playing the right notes, then jumping around randomly.  A crowd
gathers and begins to protest while Homer does the front crawl down the
keys.  All the dogs in a nearby pet store begin howling in pain.  "We're
gonna rock around a rock, around the clock toniiight!"  Homer finishes,
sliding down the keys on his knees and cracking a hole through them.
Everyone boos him, and he stands up: "Thank you, thank you very much!"}

Marge and Lisa turn the corner to see a crowd of excited little girls in
front of a Malibu Stacy display.  They gasp together.

 Lisa: I warning you, Mom: I may get a little crazy.
Marge: Oh, I understand, honey.  When I was your age, there was a --
 Lisa: [rushing at the girls] Hey, horse-face!  Get your ugly hooks off
       that Summer Fun Set!
-- Worse than Woodstock, 

  Girl 1: Look!  Achy Breaky Stacy for a dollar ninety-nine!
  Girl 2: Live from the Improv Stacy's only eighty-nine cents!
Together: [realizing] Eww!  [drop the dolls]
-- Passing doll fads, 

The two girls go up to an employee who pulls a trolley with a large
crate on it.

  Girl 2: Hey, Mister, what's in the box?
Employee: [uncomfortable] Uh, it's the, uh, new talking Malibu Stacy.
           [a crowd of little girls pause, then rush him]
   Girls: Get him!
Employee: Help!  Mr. Wise!
-- Pandemonium breaks loose, 

{On the way home, Homer uses a light-bulb oven to heat a muffin.  A bell
sounds, and he removes the muffin and starts buttering it.  Marge says
she's not sure how good an idea it is to be doing that while he drives,
but Homer dismisses her: "Marge, that's what I bought it for."}

Bart: [plays with Sergeant Thug's Mountaintop Command Post, making plane
      and machine gun noises]
 Abe: Hey, watch it with that thing!  [a missile launches out the
      window] My skull is eggshell-thin.
       [The missile explodes behind the car]
Bart: Cool!
Lisa: Thanks for buying us these toys, Grampa.
 Abe: Ehh, why didn't you get something useful, like storm windows, or a
      nice pipe organ?  I'm thirsty!  Ew, what smells like mustard?
      There're sure a lot of ugly people in your neighborhood.  Oh!
      Look at that one.
       [Homer turns into the driveway; everyone jumps out except Abe]
      Ow, my glaucoma just got worse.  The president is a Demmycrat.
       [Everyone rushes into the house]
      Hello?  I can't unbuckle my seat belt.  Hello?  [honks horn
      repeatedly]
-- The challenge of aged parents, 

Abe manages to unbuckle it eventually, and he walks in the house
proclaiming "There are too many leaves in your walkway."  He's greeted
by doors slamming all around.  Disgruntled, he sits down to watch TV.
In the background, Homer grabs a Buzz Cola and tries to sneak past
Grampa, but his foot gets caught in the phone cord and he surprises Abe.

      Abe: Why are you people avoiding me?  Does my withered face remind
           you of the grim specter of Death?
    Homer: [pause] Yes, but there's more.  [sits down on the couch]
           Dad, I love you, but -- [angry] you're a weird, sore-headed
           old crank and nobody likes you!
      Abe: Consarn it!  I guess I am an old crank.  But what am I going
           to do about it?
            [On TV, mellow music plays and three old people drink Buzz
           Cola.  Suddenly, they're transformed into partiers.  An old
           man with an H. R. Beck guitar wears Hawaiian shorts]
  Old man: One sip and I'm totally hip!
Announcer: Buzz Cola.  There's a little boogie in every bottle.
      Abe: Holy smokes, that's it!  From now on I'm thinkin', actin',
           and lookin' young, and I'm gonna start with a bottle of Buzz
           Cola.
            [Grabs it from Homer, starts to chug]
           Oh!  Ah!  Ow!  The bubbles are burning my tongue!  Ow!  Oh!
           Water! water!
-- It was the thought that counted, 

 Lisa: A hush falls over the general assembly as Stacy approaches the
       podium to deliver what will no doubt be a stirring and memorable
       address.
        [pulls Stacy's cord]
Stacy: I wish they taught shopping in school!
 Lisa: [groans, pulls Stacy's cord again]
Stacy: Let's bake some cookies for the boys!
 Lisa: Come on, Stacy.  I've waited my whole life to hear you speak.
       Don't you have anything relevant to say?  [pulls cord]
Stacy: Don't ask me, I'm just a girl.  [giggles coquettishly]
 Bart: Right on!  Say it, sister.
 Lisa: It's not funny, Bart.  Millions of girls will grow up thinking
       that this is the right way to act -- that they can never be more
       than vacuous ninnies whose only goal is to look pretty, land a
       rich husband, and spend all day on the phone with their equally
       vacuous friends talking about how damn terrific it is to look
       pretty and have a rich husband!
 Bart: [pause] Just what I was going to say.
-- Shyeah, right, 

Lisa growls and tosses Stacy away in a fit of pique.  Outside, Abe rides
a bicycle with no hands, proclaiming, "Look at me!  I'm acting young!"
Stacy flies from the house and hits Abe's front tire, sending him
flying.  He lands in a half-dug grave.  The two diggers, who were eating
their lunch, look back at the dig.  "Hey," observes Abe, "this ain't so
bad."

[End of Act one.  Time: 7:28]

At school, Lisa and all her friends play with their new Talking Malibu
Stacy dolls.

  Stacy: Let's buy makeup so the boys will like us.
   Lisa: [sighs] Don't you people see anything wrong what Malibu Stacy
         says?
Celeste: There's something wrong with what _my_ Stacy says.
  Stacy: [in a low voice] My spidey sense is tingling -- anybody call
         for a web-slinger?
   Lisa: No, Celeste.  I mean, the things she says are sexist.
  Girls: [giggle] Lisa said a dirty word!
-- Ah, to be eight again, 

At home that night, the family chows down on dinner, but Lisa's is
untouched.  She stares angrily at the doll she holds in front of her.

 Lisa: They _cannot_ keep making dolls like this...something has to be
       done!
        [Chewing stops slowly; Homer swallows noisily]
Marge: Lisa, ordinarily I'd say you should stand up for what you believe
       in.  But you've been doing that an awful lot lately!
 Bart: Yeah.  You made us march in that gay rights parade!
        [Holds up newspaper showing gay parade with Bart prominently in
       front looking surprised]
Homer: And we can't watch Fox because they own those chemical weapon
       plants in Syria.
 Lisa: I can't believe you're just going to stand by as your daughters
       grow up in a world where this, _this_, is their role model.
Marge: I had a Malibu Stacy when I was little and I turned out all
       right.  Now let's forget our troubles with a big bowl of
       strawberry ice cream!
Stacy: Now low let's forget our troubles with a big bowl of strawberry
       ice cream!
-- Subconscious memory strikes again, 

Lisa is incensed.  She decides to call the company.

Voice: Hello.  You have reached the Malibu Stacy customer service
       center.  If you have a complaint about Malibu Stacy's appearance
       or odor, press one.  If you've given Malibu Stacy a haircut and
       need to order a replacement head, press two.  For information on
       our factory tour, press three.
 Lisa: Mom!  We could go on the factory tour and I could complain in
       person!
Marge: Honey, you're not going to throw red paint at the executives, are
       you?  The Keebler people were very upset.
-- Environmentally unfriendly cookie-makers, 

Apparently Lisa leaves the red paint at home.  Marge and Lisa are taken
around by a woman who acts as their tour guide.  She drives them around
on a factory electric cart.

Tour guide: Welcome to "Enchantment Lane" where all the parts come
            together and Malibu Stacy is born.  Some folks say there's a
            little touch of fairy dust in the air.
             [Shot of grizzled men unhappily assembling dolls]
   Foreman: Aw, crap.  There's a clog in the torso chute.  Leroy!  Get
            your ass in gear.
     Leroy: Shut your hole.  [jams a mop in the chute]
             [a whole pile of torsos fall out]
-- Fairy dust and asbestos, 

Towards the end of the tour, Lisa and Marge are shown a Malibu Stacy
promotional video.

Narrator: Malibu Stacy: America's favorite eight-and-a-half incher.  In
          1959, homemaker Stacy Lavelle had a design and a dream.  The
          design?  Malibu Stacy.  The dream?  To mass market a fashion
          doll that was also edible.
          Kids didn't much like the taste of dried onion meal, but they
          _loved_ the doll.  A second, plastic Malibu Stacy took America
          by storm.  Just ask the owner of the world's largest Malibu
          Stacy collection: Wayland Smithers of Springfield.
Smithers: Hello, Malibu Stacy collectors.  I'll see _you_ [points] at
          StacyCon '94, at the San Diego Airport Hilton.
Narrator: And what does Stacy think of her thirty-five years of success
          and millions of friends worldwide?
   Stacy: Don't ask me, I'm just a girl.  [giggles]
Narrator: [chuckles] She sure is.
-- Nightmare demotional videos, 

The tour guide turns off the television.

Tour guide: Well, that's the tour.  If you have any questions, I'd be
            happy to answer --
      Lisa: I have one.
Tour guide: Yes?
      Lisa: Is the remarkably sexist drivel spouted by Malibu Stacy
            intentional, or is it just a horrible mistake?
Tour guide: [laughs] Believe me, we're very mindful of such concerns.
       Man: [wolf whistles] Hey Jiggles, grab a pad and back that
            gorgeous butt in here.
Tour guide: [laughs good-naturedly] Oh, get away, you.
       Man: Aw, don't act like you don't like it.
-- Mindful of some concerns, yes, but not others, "Lisa vs. Malibu
    Stacy"

Lisa groans.

At home, Lisa sits at the kitchen table, dejected.  Grampa sits with
her, also dejected.

 Lisa: It's awful being a kid.  No one listens to you.
  Abe: It's rotten being old.  No one listens to you.
Homer: {I'm a white male, age 18 to 49.  Everyone listens to me -- no
       matter how dumb my suggestions are.}
       {[pulls out a "nuts and gum" mixture, starts chomping]}
-- Together at last, 

Lisa: Well I'm not going to accomplish anything just sitting here --
 Abe: -- and griping.  It's time for --
Lisa: -- action!  I've got to talk to that woman who invented Malibu
      Stacy, and see if I can get her to --
 Abe: -- come out of retirement.  I'm gonna get me a job -- a real
      malibu [falters]...and see if Stacy...can help...invent...me...
      young...Help!
Lisa: You're getting a job.
 Abe: Yes!  I'm going where the action is.
-- Slipped his mind for a moment, 

Abe wears a headset and twiddles knobs on a control panel.  "Come in,
come in...Mayday!  I'm losing your transmission..." he says.  A man in
his car outside, at the Krusty Burger drive-through, yells, "I said
french fries!"  Abe seems surprised..."What the...?  We sell...french...
fries?" he says uncertainly.

Having gleaned a thing or two from the video at the Malibu Stacy
factory, Lisa looks for the home of one Wayland Smithers.

          [Lisa knocks]
Smithers: [answers] Yes?  I -- why, it's Homer Simpson's daughter.
    Lisa: I thought you might be able to help me get in touch with the
          inventor of Malibu Stacy.
 Smither: Whew!  Heh, that would be quite a feat.  Stacy Lavelle is a
          total recluse!  She hasn't appeared in public in twenty years.
          Here, I'm writing an article on her for my next Malibu Stacy
          newsletter.  It contains her last known whereabouts.  Here,
          I'll print you out a copy.
    Lisa: Thanks!
           [Smithers turns his computer on.  A bitmapped Mr. Burns
          appears]
   Burns: [with inconsistent pitch] Hello, Smithers.  You're quite good
          at turning me on.
Smithers: Um...you probably should ignore that.
-- Thank God for scanners and samplers, 

Lisa rides her bike off to the Recluse Ranch Estates.  She rides by,
looking at the houses, and stops in front of one in surprise.  She
compares it to Malibu Stacy's dream house, and they're identical.
Reasoning that this must be the home of Stacy Lavelle, she pressed the
intercom buzzer.

 Lisa: Excuse me, Miss Lavelle?  I'd like to talk to you about Malibu
       Stacy.
Stacy: Do you have any idea how many kids have tried to track me down?
 Lisa: Am I the first?
Stacy: [pause] Yes.
 Lisa: I want you to hear what Malibu Stacy is telling a generation of
       little girls.
Stacy: [the doll] Thinking too much gives you wrinkles.
        [The old iron gate creaks open slowly.  Lisa walks in]
  Boy: All right!  I've been waiting nine years to get my frisbee back.
        [He throws it, but it goes right back inside]
        [moaning] Aw!
-- Another nine years you'll wait, 

[End of Act Two.  Time: 13:29]

Inside Stacy's living room, Lisa demonstrates some more of the
incredibly sexist drivel spouted by Malibu Stacy.

Stacy: [the doll] My name is Stacy, but you can call me [wolf whistle].
Stacy: I see exactly what you mean; this is a problem.  But what do you
       expect me to do?
 Lisa: Change what she says.  It's your company.
Stacy: Not since I was forced out in 1974.  They said my way of thinking
       just wasn't cost effective.
 Lisa: [gasps] That's awful.
Stacy: Well, that, and...I was funneling profits to the Viet Cong.
-- Too late to save Saigon, 

But you _are_ Malibu Stacy.  And as long as she has your name, you have
a responsibility.  I'd be mortified if someone ever made a lousy product
with the Simpson name on it.
-- Lisa, 

Stacy: I may have had things in common with Stacy at the beginning, but
       thirty years of living her lifestyle taught me some very harsh
       lessons.  Five husbands: Ken, Johnny, Joe, Dr. Colossus, Steve
       Austin --
 Lisa: But if you can learn from Malibu Stacy's mistakes, so can
       everyone!  I'm sure we can think of something together.  Come on!
Stacy: Not now, I'm...to drunk.
 Lisa: No you're not.
        [Stacy sips slowly from a drink, then sighs]
 Lisa: Uh, I'll come back tomorrow.
-- 

Abe's job at Krusty Burger continues.

We need some more Secret Sauce.  Put this mayonnaise in the sun.
-- Mr. Peterson, manager of Krusty Burger, 

Mr. Peterson slams the door.  Abe jokes with a bored-looking kid
stuffing hamburgers (sorry, meat-flavored products) into a bag for
takeout, "Let's have some fun!"  He pulls his false teeth out, puts them
in a bun, and asks, "Ever see a sandwich that could take a bite out of
you?  Heh heh heh.  Look at the sandwich!  It's going to bite you --" he
laughs, but the bored kid grabs the sandwich and stuffs it in the bag.
The man at the window takes a bite and observes, "That sandwich took a
bite out of me!"

The next day, Lisa is back at Stacy's place.  She suggests Stacy Lavelle
and she make their own talking doll.

She'll have the wisdom of Gertrude Stein and the wit of Cathy Guisewite,
the tenacity of Nina Totenberg, and the common sense of Elizabeth Cady
Stanton!  And to top it off, the down-to-earth good looks of Eleanor
Roosevelt.
-- Lisa's talking doll plans, 

Stacy exhales smoke and smashes her drink into the fire.  "All right,
we'll make your doll."  But there's a knock at the door.

  Joe: Stacy, please, I must have you back.  Just come for a ride with
       me in my Mobile Command Unit[tm].
Stacy: Joe, I told you, it's over.  Release me from your Kung-Fu
       Grip[tm].
  Joe: Fine.  I'll bomb your house into the ground, missy.
-- Unpleasant ex-husband visits, 

Stacy sits with a clay model of the doll in front of her on the
Simpson's kitchen table.

  Lisa: Make sure you get my mom's hair just right!
 Stacy: [lops it off] Um, I think we'll use someone different for the
        hair.
  Lisa: How about me?
 Stacy: Um, there's something not quite --
  Bart: How about me?
 Stacy: I -- uh --
 Homer: How about me?
 Stacy: [frustrated] You _all_ have hideous hair!
Family: [gasps]
 Stacy: I mean, from a _design_ point of view.
-- Backpedaling quickly, 

The next step is for Lisa to record what her doll will say.  She stands
in the recording studio in front of a microphone.

Techie: Talking doll, take eight.
  Lisa: "When I get married, I'm keeping my own name."  Oh, no, that
        should probably be "If I choose to get married."
Techie: Uh, look, little girl, we got other talking dollies to record
        today.
Krusty: [barging in with cue cards] All right, you poindexters, let's
        get this right!
        One: "Hey, hey, kids, I'm Talking Krusty."
        Two: "Hey, hey, here comes Slideshow Mel" -- again -- "Here
        comes Sideshow Mel".  "Sideshow Mel".
        Three: [does a Krusty laugh]
        Budda-bing, budda-boom, I'm done.  Learn from a professional,
        kid.
         [walks out, squeals his tires away]
Techie: OK, Krusty, we are ready to roll any -- what the...?
-- Don't blink, 

At last the dolls are made!  A stack of them sit in the living room.
The family and Stacy watch while Lisa pulls the cord on one.

 Doll: Trust in yourself and you can achieve anything!
 Lisa: All right.  Now all we need is a name.
 Bart: How about Blabbermouth, the jerky doll for jerks?
 Lisa: How about Minerva, after the Roman goddess of wisdom?
Stacy: Ehh, not enough commercial appeal.
 Bart: Wendy Windbag?  Ugly Doris?  Hortense the mule-faced doll!
Stacy: I think we should name her after Lisa.  We'll call her Lisa
       Lionheart.
 Bart: No, Loudmouth Lisa!  Stupid Lisa Grabage Face!  [no one pays
       attention] I can't stand this any longer.  Somebody please pay
       attention to me!  Hello, pay attention to me!  Look at me!  I'm
       Bart, I'm Bart!  Look at me, look at me, look at me!  [waggles
       tongue]
-- Ignoring is bliss, 

Back at Kidstown USA, a display of Lisa Lionheart dolls has been set up.
Lisa is beside herself with excitement.

 Lisa: This is great.  They're really going to sell our doll!
Stacy: Well, it wasn't difficult.  I just told them who I was, and who
       you were, and they couldn't resist.
 Lisa: Really?
Stacy: Well, I didn't tell them who _you_ were.
-- Oh, no, not Lisa Simpson, 

The board of directors at the Malibu Stacy plant have gotten wind of the
new doll.

Executive: Gentlemen, we've got to sink this Lisa Lionheart doll, and
           fast!  It's time to call in a favor from Washington.
  Senator: [on phone] Yes...yes, I understand...I'll take care of it
           personally.
            [drives by the Simpson house in his limo, tosses a brick at
           the door, laughs evilly, and drives off]
     Lisa: Dad, did you hear something?
    Homer: [dumb voice] I-unno.
-- Oh, no, not the brick, 

Kent Brockman's daughter has bought a Lisa Lionheart doll already. and
she shows it happily to her father.

Daughter: Dad?
    Kent: Uh huh?
Daughter: My new doll is much better than Malibu Stacy.  Do a newscast
          about her.
    Kent: Ho ho, please, honey, Daddy's job is to bring people important
          news.  Right now I'm busy preparing a report about the
          fortieth anniversary of Beetle Bailey.
Daughter: Oh, Daddy, that is boring.  Talk about the dolly!
    Kent: [considers] Well, you were right about the Berlin Wall...
-- Who needs an AP wire?, 

Kent Brockman is true to his word.

Though it was unusual to spend 28 minutes reporting on a doll, this
reporter found it impossible to stop talking.  It's just really
fascinating news, folks.  Good night!
 [Music starts playing and credits roll]
Oh, and the President was arrested for murder.  More on that tomorrow
night, or you can turn to another channel.
 [Looks off to the side]
Oh.  Do not turn to another channel.
-- Kent Brockman, intrepid reporter, 

The execs at Malibu Stacy watch his newscast too.

Executive: Our one effort to put a stop to this Lisa Lionheart thing has
           failed miserably.  Gentlemen, we have to reinvent Malibu
           Stacy for the nineties.  [ominous] We'll stay here all night
           if need be.
      Man: Can we order Chinese food?
Executive: [pause] Yes.
            [Everyone starts talking excitedly]
-- Great motivators, 

Meanwhile, Abe fields complaints from all the old people eating at the
Krusty Burger.

Jasper: I cut my tongue on these pancakes.
 Woman: These eggs are difficult to digest.  I want soft-boiled eggs!
   Abe: I told you, we don't have soft-boiled eggs!  If you want -- by
        gum, you're right!  We should have 'em.  I shouldn't be
        listening to complaints; I should be making them with you guys!
        The good Lord lets us grow old for a reason: to gain the wisdom
        to find fault with everything He's made.
        Mr. Peterson, you can take this job and...fill it.  And one more
        thing -- I never once washed my hands.  That's your policy, not
        mine.
-- Abe fesses up, 

The old people all yell their encouragement, then they carry Abe off on
their shoulders like the hero he is.  But they only get about five feet
before their weak legs and backs buckle.

A crowd of little girls wait anxiously for the opening of the toy store
so they can be the first to get Lisa Lionheart.  Smithers waits with
them, too, greedily anticipating the joy.  When the doors are opened,
the crowd stampedes in.  "Look," cries one girl, "it's Lisa Lionheart!"
Another encourages them, "Keep running!  We're almost there!"

They almost make it, except an employee pulls a cart full of Malibu
Stacy dolls "with NEW hat" in their path.  They all stop: "They changed
Malibu Stacy!" one exclaims.  "She is better than ever!" says another.
Lisa tries to point out that the only difference is her stupid cheap
hat.  "She still embodies all the awful stereotypes she did before!"
Smithers is quick to point out, "But she's got a new hat."  This is all
it takes for the girls to ignore Lisa Lionheart in favor of the cheap-
hatted dolls.

 Lisa: [sigh] Well, I guess you can't beat big business.  There's just
       no room for the little guy.
 Lisa: [the doll] Trust in yourself, and you can achieve anything!
        [another girl plays with Lisa Lionheart and smiles]
 Lisa: You know, if we get through to just that one little girl, it'll
       all be worth it!
Stacy: Yes.  Particularly if that little girl happens to pay $46,000 for
       that doll.
 Lisa: What?
Stacy: Oh, nothing.
-- Financial loss but emotional gain, 

Stacy offers Lisa kudos.  They are about to leave the store when Homer
glances back.  "Marge, Lisa, Lady," he begins, "if you'll excuse me I've
got something very important to attend to."  He runs back to the giant
keyboard on the floor and plays the theme to the Simpsons.  Three
employees rush over and try to remove him, and they succeed, but not
before smashing it once again.

[End of Act Three.  Time: 21:25]
 EPISODE TITLE: Deep Space Homer


EPISODE SUMMARY: 
[Syndication cuts are marked in curly braces "{}" and are courtesy of
Ricardo Lafaurie and Frederic Briere.]

Grim music plays at the nuclear power plant as Smithers' voice comes
over the PA system.  "Attention.  All workers trudge immediately to the
main yard for the mandatory 'Worker of the Week award' festivities."
Each person must walk through an X-ray machine watched by several
security guards.  One of them watches each worker: "Clean.  Clean.
Pistol.  Uzi.  Two kids posing as an adult.  Oh -- " he says, seeing a
Neanderthal-looking skeleton, "hey Homer."

 Carl: I hate these "Worker of the Week Award" ceremonies.
Lenny: Who even cares any more?  Everyone at work sure has already got
       one.
 Carl: Except foooooor --
Homer: Hello!  Well, today's the day for Homer J.!  I _know_ I'm going
       to win this time.
Lenny: Yeah?  How come?
Homer: Union rule 26.  "Every employee must win 'Worker of the Week' at
       least once, regardless of gross incompetence, obesity, or rank
       odor."  Heh heh heh heh.
-- He's a shoo-in, then, 

Smithers uses a megaphone to make an announcement.

Smithers: Attention, everyone.  Let's have an awed hush please for Mr.
          Burns.
           [Everyone gasps]
   Burns: Compadres, it is imperative that we crush the freedom fighters
          before the start of the rainy season.  And remember, a shiny
          new donkey for whoever brings me the head of Colonel Montoya.
           [Smithers whispers to him]
          Hmm?  What?  Oh, and by that I mean, of course, it's time for
          the "Worker of the Week Award".  I can't believe we've
          overlooked this week's winner for so very, very long.  We
          simply could not function without his tireless efforts.  So, a
          round of applause for...this inanimate carbon rod!
           [Everyone cheers]
   Homer: [growls] Ooh...inanimate, huh?  I'll show him inanimate!
           [stands perfectly still while his shadow elongates]
-- Homer, master impressionist, 

Homer is despondent that night at dinner.

Homer: Stupid carbon rod.  It's all just a popularity contest!
 Bart: Wow!  Did you actually get to _see_ the rod?
Marge: Oh, I'm sorry, Homey.
Homer: [mournful] Nobody respects me at work.
Marge: Well _we_ respect you!
        [Bart writes "Insert Brain Here" on the back of Homer's head]
        [Lisa and Bart laugh]
       Bart, I told you, don't draw on your father's skull.
        [Marge reads it and begins to chuckle]
-- Once a Simpson, always a Simpson, 

Since everyone's laughing, Homer asks, "What does it say?  I want to
see!"  He tries spinning around to see it, but only ends up falling on
the ground and gasping as he continues to run in circles.  The family's
laughter tapers off slowly.  Soon, they all groan.

Homer: Ah, TV respects me.  It laughs _with_ me, not at me!
        [Turns it on; a man points at him]
  Man: You stupid -- [laughs uncontrollably]
Homer: D'oh!  [switches channels]
-- 

The channel Homer happened to flick to shows two men talking about the
impending launch of the space shuttle.

  Tom: It's a lovely day for a launch, here, live at Cape Canaveral, at
       the lower end of the Florida Peninsula, and the purpose of
       today's mission is truly, really electrifying.
Man 2: That's correct, Tom.  The lion's share of this flight will be
       devoted to the study of the effects of weightlessness on tiny
       screws.
  Tom: Unbelievable, and just imagine the logistics of weightlessness.
       And of course, this could have literally millions of applications
       here on Earth -- everything from watchmaking to watch repair.
Homer: Boring.
        [tries to switch channels, but the batteries fall from the
       remote control]
       No!  The batteries!
  Tom: Now let's look at the crew a little.
Man 2: They're a colorful bunch.  They've been dubbed "the Three
       Musketeers".  Heh heh heh --
  Tom: And we laugh legitimately.  There's a mathematician, a different
       _kind_ of mathematician, and a statistician.
Homer: Make it stop!  [panics]
 Bart: Oh no, not another boring space launch.  Change the channel.
       Change the channel!
Homer: I can't!  I can't!
        [Bart dives for the plug and tears it from the wall]
        [He and Homer both sigh]
-- Close call, 

Meanwhile, at Mission Control...

Assistant: Sir, we've run into a serious problem with the mission.
           These Nielsen ratings are the lowest ever.  [holds a piece of
           paper]
Scientist: Oh my God...we've been beaten by "A Connie Chung Christmas!"
-- NASA's ultimate nightmare, 

A meeting is called to discuss the ratings fiasco.

Scientist: People, we're in danger of losing our funding.  America isn't
           interested in space exploration any more.
Assistant: Maybe we should finally tell them the big secret: that all
           the chimps we sent into space came back super-intelligent.
    Chimp: No, I don't think we'll be telling them _that_.
            [Roller skates away, making monkey noises]
-- The best-kept secret, 

Scientist: We need a fresh angle to keep the public interested.
Assistant: The public see our astronauts as clean-cut, athletic go-
           getters.  They hate people like that.
    Woman: Well, who do they like?
Assistant: Well, here are the most popular personalities on television,
           or "TV".
            [Turns one on, shows "Home Improvement"]
   Taylor: I did it!  I supercharged my riding mower.
            [Makes his characteristic noises.  Backs through a fence by
           mistake]
           Oh, no!  I've killed Wilson.  Looks like it's back to jail
           for me.
            [Makes more train noises]
            [The next channel shows "Married...With Children"]
      Peg: [whines] Al...let's have sex!
       Al: Ehh, no Peg.
            [Audience laughs and claps]
            [Al flushes a toilet, and everyone hollers and cheers]
-- Fox: only the best programs, 

The scientist sees the common theme in the popular shows.

Researcher: Why, they're all a bunch of blue-collar slobs!
 Scientist: People, that's who we need for our next astronaut.
 Assistant: I suggest a lengthy, inefficient search.  At the taxpayers'
            expense, of course.
 Scientist: I wish there was an easier way.
             [Phone rings]
     Homer: Hello, is this NASA?
 Scientist: Yes?
     Homer: Good!  Listen: I'm sick of your boring space launches.  Now
            I'm just an ordinary, blue-collar slob, but I know what I
            likes on TV.
 Scientist: How did you get this number?
     Homer: Shut up!  And another thing: how come I can't get no Tang
            'round here?  And also --
             [a toilet flushes]
 Scientist: People, our long search is over.
-- At no expense to the taxpayers, yet, 

Homer's next phone call from Moe's is to the President of the United
States.

    Homer: Hello, is this President Clinton?  Good!  I figured if anyone
           knew where to get some Tang, it'd be you.  ...Shut up!
Assistant: Excuse me --
    Homer: Aah!
Assistant: Are you the person that called NASA yesterday?
    Homer: No, it wasn't me, I swear!  It was...him!  [points to Barney]
Scientist: Sir, how would you like to get higher than you've ever been
           in your life?
   Barney: Be an astronaut?  Sure!
Scientist: Well, welcome aboard.  I think you'll find this will win you
           the respect of your family and friends.
    Homer: [gasps] Respect?  Nooo!  It was me.  _I_ made the crank call.
           I do it all the time!  Check with the FBI: I have a file.  I
           have a file!
Scientist: Ehh, better take both of them.
            [The assistant clubs Barney and Homer, knocking them out]
           I don't really think that was necessary; they _wanted_ to be
           astronauts.
Assistant: I know.
-- 

[End of Act One.  Time: 6:05]

Homer drags his whole family down to Florida in a Beverly Hillbillies-
style junker.  They arrive at a gate through which a guard motions them.

The scientist has called a press conference.  He stands at a podium on a
stage in front of red curtains.

Scientist: Ladies and gentlemen and members of the press.  I'd like to
           present the new generation of NASA astronauts: the average
           American.
            [Curtain rises to show Homer wearing a "Hail to the Chef"
           apron and Barney dressed as a golfer]
 Reporter: Jim Wallace, Associated Press.  [clears throat] Is this a
           joke?
Scientist: [cheery] Far from it, Jim.  One of these men will prove space
           travel is within the reach of the common man.
 Reporter: Toby Hunter, Minneapolis Star.  No really, is this a joke?
Scientist: No, Toby, and no more questions about whether this is a joke.
            [Everyone lowers their hand, dejected]
-- 

Another reporter decides to grill Homer.

 Reporter: Uh, question for the barbeque chef.  Don't you think there is
           an inherent danger in sending underqualified civilians into
           space?
    Homer: I'll field this one.  The only danger is if they send us to
           [ominous] that terrible Planet of the Apes.  Wait a minute...
           Statue of Liberty...that was _our_ planet!  You maniacs!  You
           blew it up!  Damn you!  Damn you all to hell!  [weeps]
   Barney: [burps] Oh -- [falls over]
Scientist: Thank you, that's all we have time for.
-- The NASA press conference, 

The scientist tries to impress on Homer and Barney the weight of their
responsibility.

Scientist: Now of course only one of you will be chosen to go into
           space.  So the next few weeks will be a grueling series of
           tests to determine which one of you is most qualified.
Assistant: Oh, and Mr. Gumble: for the duration of the training there
           will be no more beer.
   Barney: What?  Three whole weeks with only wine?  I'll go crazy!
    Homer: And may the best man win.  [whispers to assistant] He's got a
           big drinking problem; could embarrass the program.  Meet me
           up in that tree later and I'll tell you more.
-- Good sportsmanship, 

At their new homette on-site, the family sits down for dinner.

 Bart: Wow, my father an astronaut.  I feel so full of...what's the
       opposite of shame?
Marge: Pride?
 Bart: No, not _that_ far from shame.
Homer: [quavering] Less shame?
 Bart: [happy] Yeah...
-- English has a word for everything, 

Marge: You know, Homer, when I found out about this, I went through a
       wide range of emotions.  First I was nervous, then anxious, then
       wary, then apprehensive, then...kind of sleepy, then worried, and
       then concerned, but now I realize that being a spaceman is
       something you have to do.
Homer: Who's doing what now?
-- Does Marge read "Life in Hell"?, 

The next day, Homer shows up for training eating a pink donut.  (But not
wearing a pink shirt.  Careful, he wets his -- oh, never mind.)

    Homer: Well, here I am, right on time.  I don't see Barney "Let's
           crash the rocket into the White House and kill the President"
           Gumble...
Assistant: Actually, he's been here since sunrise.
            [Barney works with a punching bag]
   Barney: Hi Homer.  Since they made me stop drinking, I've regained my
           balance and diction!  Observe: [does backflips] "I am the
           very model of a modern major general, I've information
           vegetable, animal, and mineral."
    Homer: Oh, that's nothing.  Watch this: [does cartwheels] "There
           once was a man fron Nantucket, Whose --" [smashes into a
           wall]
-- Let's not complete that limerick, 

Both men are tested on the centrifugal force machine, their faces taking
on obscene-looking shapes (Homer's remarkably reminiscent of Popeye).
They both blow into small tubes connected to columns filled with water
and a white ball, to test the strength of their lungs.  Homer drinks his
water instead, sighing, "Mmm...mediciney."  {They are even forced to do
battle in a futuristic arena while everyone watches.  The assistant
whispers, "I wager 400 quatloos on the newcomer."}

Scientist: Gentlemen, I'd like you to meet the two experienced
           astronauts who will accompany the winner into space: Race
           Banyon and Buzz Aldrin, the second man on the moon!
     Buzz: {Second comes right after first.
            [Long pause]}
           So Barney, we hear you're kickin' ass.
    Homer: [contemptuous] I, er, don't think this contest is over yet,
           "Buzz"...if that _is_ your real name.  I believe there is
           still a little something called "The Swimsuit Competition".
Scientist: There's no swimsuit competition, Homer.
    Homer: [voice rising] You mean I shaved my bikini zone for nothing?!
-- That's what he means, 

At last, the big day arrives.  Barney does somersaults while holding
onto some gymnast's rings as Homer stands there.  The scientist and his
assistant approach, and Barney does a perfect dismount.

Scientist: Gentlemen, you've both worked very hard.  And in a way,
           you're both winners.  But in another more accurate way,
           Barney is the winner.
    Homer: [downcast] Congratulations, Barney.
Scientist: That's very gracious of you, Homer.  Please join us in a
           toast...to the mission!
            [The four of them drink, and Barney looks slightly crazed]
   Barney: It begins...[grabs the bottle and chugs]
-- So close and yet so far, 

The two men try to restrain Barney, but he breaks free and runs for a
rocket backpack.  Drunkenly yodeling a fanfare, he straps it on and
blasts off.  But it runs out of fuel in midair.  Barney bounces
repeatedly off the corrugated metal roof of a pillow factory, then lands
in the middle of the road, only to be run over by a marshmallow truck.
"I don't understand it," says the assistant, "that was non-alcoholic
champagne."

Scientist: [resigned] Well, Homer, I guess you're the winner by default.
    Homer: Default?  Woo hoo!  The two sweetest words in the English
           language: de-fault!  De-fault!  De-fault!
            [assistant clubs him]
Scientist: Where'd you get that, anyway?
Assistant: Sent away.
-- Thank God for mail-order, 

[End of Act Two.  Time: 11:13]

The Itchy and Scratchy cartoon is a topical one: "Scar Trek: The Next
Laceration".  Scratchy pilots a spaceship, eating a baloney sandwich and
licking his fingers as he swallows it whole.  But his stomach starts to
bulge out, and he screams as Itchy breaks through, holding the
undigested sandwich.  Out of spite, Itchy eats the sandwich himself and
tosses the cat in the airlock, pressing the button to blow him into
space.  Luckily, Scratchy is prepared, and he snaps his space suit
helmet on just as he is ejected.

Floating free in space doesn't save him, however.  Itchy goes out in a
space pod with arms and giggles, grabbing Scratchy's body.  He carries
the body up to the rings of a nearby planet and saws the unfortunate cat
in half.  Scratchy chases after his lower half, but it burns up as it
enters the planet's atmosphere.  He shrugs, but Itchy flies up to him,
grabs his torso, and removes his helmet.  His head enlarges in the
vacuum, and Itchy bursts it with a pin.  "THE END" appears on the screen
in Scratchy's blood.

Announcer: The preceding program contained scenes of extreme violence
           and should not have been viewed by young children.
            [Bart and Lisa cackle with mirth]
-- Pointless disclaimers after Itchy and Scratchy, 

Homer sweats as his children laugh.

Next, we see a shot of Homer, Race, and Buzz, all wearing their space
suits, striding towards us down a hall.  They approach the shuttle in
which they'll be flying.  Homer looks up at it with awe, and becomes
frightened.  "Noooo!" he yells, then runs back down the hall, panting.
He loses his nerve and calls Marge.

Homer: Marge...I don't really want to go through with this.  But being
       an astronaut is how I got you to respect me!
Marge: Homer, when I met you, you weren't an astronaut.  You didn't even
       know how to use a touchtone, but I _still_ respected you and I
       always will, no matter what.
        [touchtone sounds come from the phone]
       Homer, you already dialed.
-- I can't believe they invented it, 

Marge: But on the other hand, when you don't take advantage of an
       opportunity, you can end up regretting it for the rest of your
       life.
Homer: You're right, Marge.  Just like the time I could have met Mr. T
       at the mall.  The entire day I kept saying, "I'll go a little
       later.  I'll go a little later."  And then when I got there, they
       told me he'd just left.  And when I asked the mall guy if he
       would ever come back again, he said he didn't know.  Well, I'm
       never going to let something like that happen again!  I'm going
       into space right now!
Marge: Oh, I am so proud of you.  And I know it's going to go just fine
       --
        [touchtone sounds come from the phone]
       Mmm...
-- I still can't believe they invented it, 

At the Cape, a voice announces, "T minus three minutes till liftoff and
counting."

      Buzz: Mission Control, this is Corvair.  Launch sequence
            initiated.  All systems go.
     Homer: Are we there yet?  I'm thirsty.
      Race: Mission Control, request permission to sedate cargo ahead of
            schedule.
Controller: Permission denied.
-- Busted!, 

Race: Payload checklist.  IRS surveillance satellite --
Buzz: Check.
Race: Ant farm --
Buzz: Check.
Race: Children's letters to God --
Buzz: Check.
-- Only the essentials on _this_ mission, 

The voice counts down, "Three, two, one, make rocket go now!"  It lifts
off.  The G forces are very strong, and they cause Homer to take on a
Nixon-like appearance briefly.

Marge, her sisters, Grampa, and the kids all watch at home.

    Bart: Go, Dad, go!
    Lisa: "How doth the hero strong and brave,
          A celestial path in the heavens pave."
Everyone: Huh?
    Lisa: [quiet] Go, Dad, go.
-- No time for eloquence, 

Good news at Mission Control, too.

Assistant: Sir, the TV ratings for the launch are the highest in ten
           years.
 Everyone: Yay!
Scientist: And how's the spacecraft doing?
Assistant: I dunno.  All this equipment is just used to measure TV
           ratings.
-- Equipment purchased at the taxpayers' expense, 

It's beautiful.  It's the most awe-inspiring sight I have ever seen.
Giver of life, mother of us all...hey guys, look what I smuggled aboard!
[shows a bag of chips]
-- Homer, just after lift-off, 

Buzz warns him, "Homer, no!"  But it's too late: Homer opens the bag
nonetheless.  The chips float about the cabin, and Race rues, "They'll
clog the instruments!"  Buzz is worried: "Careful!  They're ruffled."
Homer has the solution, however; he unbuckles his seat belt, and
accompanied by "The Blue Danube Waltz", he floats about the cabin,
eating the chips.  But his head drifts perilously close to the ant
colony.

Ant 1: Protect the queen!
Ant 2: Which one's the queen?
Ant 3: I'm the queen!
Ant 1: No you're not!
Homer: Nooo!  [his head smashed the colony, and the ants float free]
Ant 1: Freedom!  Horrible, horrible freedom!
 Buzz: You fool!  Now we may never know if ants can be trained to sort
       tiny screws in space.
-- The bane of humanity, 

Controller: Er, some good news, gentlemen.  We have quite a treat for
            you.  We've been able to coax superstar James Taylor in here
            to Mission Control to wish you well and play you a little
            bit of his own brand of laid-back adult contemporary music.
     Homer: Wow, former president James Taylor.
    Taylor: How ya doin', fellas?
      Buzz: With all due respect, Mr. Taylor, this isn't the best time
            for your unique brand of bittersweet folk rock.  We have a
            potentially critical situation here.  I'm sure you'll
            understand.
    Taylor: Listen, Aldrin, I'm not as laid back as people think.  Now
            here's the deal: I'm going to play, and you're going to
            float there and like it.
             [sings]
            When you're down, and troubled,
            And you need a helping hand,
            And nothing, oh, nothing is going right...
-- Strangely apt choice of lyrics, 

Kent Brockman reports on Channel Six.

    Kent: We're just about to get our first pictures from inside the
          spacecraft with "average-naut" Homer Simpson, and we'd like to
          -- aah!
           [Camera shows a close-up of an ant floating in front of the
          three astronauts]
Everyone: Aah!
    Kent: Ladies and gentlemen, er, we've just lost the picture, but,
          uh, what we've seen speaks for itself.  The Corvair spacecraft
          has been taken over -- "conquered", if you will -- by a master
          race of giant space ants.  It's difficult to tell from this
          vantage point whether they will consume the captive earth men
          or merely enslave them.  One thing is for certain, there is no
          stopping them; the ants will soon be here.
          And I, for one, welcome our new insect overlords.  I'd like to
          remind them that as a trusted TV personality, I can be helpful
          in rounding up others to toil in their underground sugar
          caves.
   Marge: Mmm, don't worry, kids.  I'm sure your father's all right.
    Lisa: What are you basing that on, Mom?
           [pause]
   Marge: [with forced cheer] Who wants ginger snaps?
-- I do!  Me too, please!, 

James Taylor continues to sing to the hapless astronauts.  "{There's
hours of time on the telephone line,/Talking 'bout things to
come.}/Sweet dreams, and flying machines,/And pieces on the ground --
um..." He pauses, then continues, "Sweet dreams, and flying
machines,/Flying safely through the air..."

Things go from bad to worse on the spaceship.  Some of the ants land on
the controls and crawl into them.

     Race: Oh my God, the ants are shorting out our navigation systems!
            [the astronauts smack back and forth into the walls]
   Taylor: Ants, huh?  We had quite a severe ant problem at the vineyard
           this year.  I had Art Garfunkel come by with his compressor,
           and we created a total vacuum outside the house, and we blew
           the ants out the front door.  But I'm sure you high-tech NASA
           people could care less about our resort-town ways.
Assistant: [menacing] Quiet, you --
Scientist: Wait a minute...this unkempt youngster might just be on to
           something.
-- Unkempt?  Young?  Naah, 

Race and Buzz prepare the shuttle to be evacuated of air.  Buzz pushes
the button with a "Make hatch blow now!"  The ants and chips get sucked
out, as planned, and Homer (who has forgotten to attach his seat belt)
dusts off his hands, says, "And that is that!"  He, too, gets sucked
towards the hatch.

Luckily, he manages to grab the handle of the door, but it bends under
the strain.  "Oh my God," says the scientist, "this is a disaster!"
James Taylor uses the distraction to run away.

Homer hangs outside the shuttle still, and the handle finally gives in
and snaps off.  Fortunately, Buzz and Race are there to grab him.

 Buzz: Homer, you broke the handle.
 Race: With that hatch open, we'll burn up on re-entry!  That's it: if I
       go, I'm taking you to hell with me.
Homer: Wait a minute, Race.  Wait a minute...wait!
        [breaks off a support rod]
       Aha!  Now I'll bust that pretty face of yours!
        [tries to swing it, but it catches in the door]
       Aw, stupid bar.
 Buzz: Wait, Homer.  If that bar holds, we just might make it back to
       earth.
Homer: Oh.  [voice rising] I'll bash you good!
-- One-track minds, 

Well, this reporter was...possibly a little hasty earlier and would like
to...reaffirm his allegiance to this country and its human president.
May not be perfect, but it's still the best government we have.  For
now.
 [notices "HAIL ANTS" sign taped up, tears it down]
Oh, yes, by the way, the spacecraft still in extreme danger, may not
make it back, attempting risky reentry, bla bla bla bla bla bla.  We'll
see you after the movie.
-- Kent Brockman, backpedaling furiously, 

On the dangerous trip back through the atmosphere, the shuttle heats up
until it glows red.  Buzz and Race hum, "The Battle Hymn of the
Republic," while Homer sings, "Oh, those Golden Grahams.  Oh, those
Golden Grahams.  Crispy, crunchy, graham cereal, brand new breakfast
treat..."

The Simpson family still watch in suspense.

Lisa: Come on, Dad.  You can make it!
 Abe: Aw, of course he'll make it.  It's TV.
-- Metahumor, 

The spaceship hurtles towards the earth at a dangerous speed.  It
smashes into the building where the press is housed, which is convenient
in terms of post-trip interviews.

     Tom: Uh, how'd you solve the door dilemma?
    Buzz: Homer Simpson was the real hero here.  He jury-rigged the door
          closed using this.
   Man 1: Hey, what is that?
   Man 2: It's an inanimate carbon rod!
Everyone: Yay!
           [Time magazine cover: "In Rod We Trust"]
-- Rod Flanders?  Nope, 

A parade is organized in honor of the rod.  It gets to ride in its own
limousine.  The family watch the parade, but Homer turns the TV off
angrily.

       [Homer shuts off the TV]
 Bart: Aw, they were just about to show some close-ups of the rod!
Homer: Oh, stupid rod!  I got gypped.
Marge: Oh, Homey, you should be proud!  Only a handful of people have
       done what you've done.
 Lisa: Yeah, Dad!  How many people have seen the icecaps and the deserts
       all at once, or the majesty of the Northern Lights from one
       hundred miles above?
Homer: Yeah, maybe I do have the right...what's that stuff?
-- Uh, stuff?, 

Homer thanks his wife and elder daughter.  "Bart, do you have something
nice to say to your father?"  Bart, who has just written "HERO" on
Homer's head, says, "Ehh, he knows how I feel."  He tosses the marker in
the air, and we watch it close up, tumbling slowly.

It turns into a FOX satellite in space, descending slowly to "Also
Sprach Zarathustra".  It hits a glass ball containing a baby Homer in
it, who says, "D'oh!" indignantly.

[End of Act Three.  Time: 21:24]
 EPISODE TITLE: Homer Loves Flanders


EPISODE SUMMARY: 
[Syndication cuts are marked in curly braces "{}" and are courtesy of
Ricardo Lafaurie and Frederic Briere.]

The Simpsons watch yet another edition of "Eye on Springfield", with
your host, Kent Brockman.

 Kent: Tonight, on "Eye on Springfield": just miles from your doorstep,
       hundreds of men are given weapons and trained to kill.  The
       government calls it the "army", but a more alarmist name would be
       -- "The Killbot Factory."
       But first: Springfield has come down with a fever.  Football
       fever, brought on by the biggest game of the year: the Pigskin
       Classic between the Shelbyville Sharks and our own Springfield
       Atoms.  If you have the fever, there's only one cure; take two
       tickets and see the game Sunday morning.
  Man: Warning: tickets should not be taken internally.
Homer: See?  Because of me, now they have a warning.
-- Something to be proud of, 

Bart decides to take advantage of the situation.

 Bart: [sly] Hey Dad, sell you these for fifty bucks...
Homer: Woo hoo!  Sold.  [gives Bart money]
        [Bart runs off]
Marge: [tired] Those aren't tickets to the game, Homer.
Homer: What do you mean?  It says right here: "Free wig with every
       purchase of large wig.  Downtown Wig Center".  Why you little --
       hmm, free wig...
        [imagines looking at himself wearing a Marge wig]
        [falsetto] I love you, Homey.  Mmm..
        [normal voice] Heh heh, I don't need her at all any more.
-- The power of fantasy, 

Homer can't resist the big game, so he camps out in front of the ticket
booth.  And his strategy pays off -- he's second in the huge line.

Homer: Heh heh heh, I did it!  Second in line, and all I had to do was
       miss eight days of work.
  Man: With the money you would have made working, you could have bought
       tickets from a scalper.
Homer: In theory, yes.  [sotto voce] Jerk.
-- Marginal productivity of labor., 

The wicket opens for selling tickets.  The first man in line steps up.

  Man: Give me, er, 30,000 tickets.
Woman: That'll be $950,000 please.
  Man: Look, the thing about that is, I only got $10 on me.  Can I pay
       you the rest later?
Woman: Sure.
-- Gee, you think he's scamming you?, 

The man walks off with a big stack of tickets, and the woman puts a
"Sold Out" sign in the window.  Homer sighs and slumps against the
wicket.

On the way to work.  Homer listens to KBBL.

       [sound of Bobby McFerrin song finishing]
Marty: That was Bobby McFerrin's new one, "I'm Worried (Need Money)".
       If you want tickets to the big Pigskin Classic [oinking noise]
       just get to a phone and be our thirteenth caller.
Homer: Get tickets.  Must get tickets!  Find phone.  Yes!
        [arrives at work behind a line of cars]
       Ho ho, stupid sheep.
        [drives the wrong way through the gate, bursts all his tires]
Marty: Still waiting for that caller...
Homer: [runs in whimpering, grabs phone]
Marty: Oh, we have a winner!  What's your name, sir?
  Ned: Ned Flanders!
Homer: Oh, not Flanders, anybody but Flanders --
  Ned: Well, golly, if that doesn't put the "shaz" in "shazam."  Oh,
       listen: what's the cash value of those tickets so I can report it
       on my income tax?
-- Goody two-shoes Ned, 

In impotent rage, Homer raises his head {and hits the radio.  It flips
to a station playing Eddie Money's "Two Tickets to Paradise",
appropriately.  Homer sings along and even plays air guitar to the
guitar solo.  "Excellent guitar riff," he comments.}

That night at home, Homer laments his fate.

Homer: Why am I such a loser?  Why?
 Bart: Well, your father was a loser, and _his_ father, and his
       father...it's genetic, man.  [realizes] D'oh!
-- That's not the only genetic thing, either, 

   Lisa: What's so special about this game anyway?  It's just another
         chapter in the pointless rivalry between Springfield and
         Shelbyville.  They built a mini-mall, so we built a bigger
         mini-mall.  They made the world's largest pizza, so we burnt
         down their city hall.
  Homer: Heh heh heh.  Yeah, they swore they'd get us back by spiking
         our water supply.  But they didn't have the guts.
  Marge: [drinks tap water, sees the walls start to run]
         Ooooh.  The walls are melting again.  [giggles]
Chicken: [getting out of the oven] Personally, I think I'm overdone.
          [flies away]
-- Drugs and cooking don't mix, 

Homer tries for the second last resort of the scoundrel: prayer.

Homer: God, if you really are God, you'll get me tickets to that game.
        [doorbell rings]
  Ned: Heidely-ho, neighbor.  Wanna go to the game with me?  I got two
       tick --
Homer: [slams the door] Why do you mock me, O Lord?
Marge: Homer, that's not God.  That's just a waffle that Bart tossed up
       there.
        [Marge scrapes it off into Homer's hands]
Homer: I know I shouldn't eat thee, but -- [bites] Mmm, sacrilicious.
-- No waffle too sacred, 

That night, Homer sneaks over to Ned's house with a lead pipe in his
hand.

       [Homer rings Ned's doorbell]
Marge: [calling from window] Homer?
Homer: Huh?
Marge: Are you planning to hit Ned Flanders with that pipe and take his
       tickets?
Homer: Ye -- no...
  Ned: [answers door] Huh?  [Homer winds up]
Homer: Oh.  [winds down] Flanders, I decided I'd like to go to the game
       with you.
  Ned: Well, get out the Crayloas and color me "Tickled Pink".  Ooh,
       what's with the lead pipe, were you going to give my noggin a
       flogging?
Homer: [sheepish] Well, yeah.
        [both chuckle]
-- Ned, the good sport, 

At the Shelbyville stadium, Ned and Homer drive past Carl &amp; Lenny.

Homer: [gasps] Duck!  I can't let the boys see me with you!
  Ned: What?
Homer: [grunts, pushes Ned down] Hi!
Lenny: Hey!  Look, Homer's got one of those robot cars!
        [the car crashes]
 Carl: One of those _American_ robot cars.
-- Carl the cynic, 

{On the field, Monty Burns tries to inspire the hulking giant Atoms to
the height of their athletic prowess.}

   Burns: {[to players] Men, there's a little crippled boy sitting in a
          hospital who wants you to win this game.  I know because I
          crippled him myself to inspire you.}
Milhouse: {[to his parents] I hope they win, or Mr. Burns said he's
          coming back.}
-- No plan too dastardly, 

{Ned and Homer take their seats.  "Well, these are amazing seats, huh,
Homer?" he asks.  Homer agrees, then blows up a beach ball.  He
announces to the crowd behind him, "Here comes fun!" and hits it back
towards them.  For his pain, someone throws a beer can at him.}

Mayor Quimby sits at the end of the same row as Ned and Homer.  He
orders two hot dogs, two sodas, and two ice cream bars.  As they are
passed along the row towards him, Homer snatches two bites from his
dogs.  When they arrive, Quimby asks menacingly, "What the hell happened
to my dogs?  I want answers!"  He and his bodyguards stand up.

Ned returns laden down with food.

Homer: Well, I guess I should pay my share.
  Ned: [laughs] Relax, Homer.  I keep telling you, you're my guest.
Homer: Ooh, you brought me a nacho hat!  Thanks, Ned.
        [dips a nacho in it, then eats it]
        [sings] Nacho, nacho man, I want to be a nacho man...
-- Not as creative as "Baby on Board", 

A bulldozer comes by to clean the big pile of garbage Homer has dumped
on the field in front of his seat.

At last, the score is 27-21 for Shelbyville, and the game is in its
final seconds.

 Stan: [calling a play] Blue 27 on three.
Homer: If anyone can pull it off, it's Stan "The Boy" Taylor.
Crowd: {Stan, Stan, he's our boy,
       If he can't do it, no one -- will.}
-- Non-intuitive nicknames, 

And the ball is snapped!  A huge melee forms in front of Stan, and he
must go long to his wide receiver.  The throw is good!  But the man
covering manages to force him out of bounds right at the goal marker.
Is it good?

The referee thinks about it, then calls it...touchdown!  The crowd goes
wild.  Homer goes wild too, kissing Ned many times in his joy.  Ned
laughs uncomfortably.  "Losers!  Losers!  Kiss my big Springfield
behind, Shelbyville!"  Homer taunts.  Someone throws another beer can at
him, but he ducks and scoffs.  Someone else nails him with a whole keg,
however.

When the Atom players leave the stadium, Homer begs for an autograph.

Homer: Hey!  Somebody sign an autograph?  Please?  Somebody...sign an
       autograph?  Hey, would you sign a...You fat, stupid jerks!
        [the players turn around]
       It was him!  [points at Flanders]
 Stan: Ned?  Is that -- Ned Flanders?
  Ned: Heidely-ho, Stanster.
Homer: You know Stan Taylor?
 Stan: Know me?  Ned Flanders saved me.  I used to party all night and
       sleep with lingerie models until Ned and his bible group showed
       me that I could have more.
Homer: Professional athletes, always wantin' more.
 Stan: Ned, they gave me the game ball, but I want you to have it.
Homer: [gasps]
  Ned: Tell you what -- Homer Simpson here's just about the biggest Atom
       fan that's ever graced God's green earth.  I bet he'd enjoy it
       even more than me!
 Stan: Sure, anything for Neddy.  Here you go!
Homer: Wow.  Now I have four children.  [to ball] You will be called
       "Stitchface".
-- A rough name to start life with, 

Homer admits Ned has been the nicest to him that anyone has ever been.
On the drive out of the parking lot, they see Carl and Lenny again.

  Ned: Oh, I guess it's time for me to duck again.
Homer: No!  I want everyone to know that -- [yells] this is Ned
       Flanders, my friend!
Lenny: What'd he say?
 Carl: I dunno.  Something about being gay.
-- Something like that, yeah, 

[End of Act One.  Time: 8:09]

Homer throws away his wedding picture from the mantlepiece in order to
clear a space for Stitchface.

       [Homer throws a picture into the garbage]
Marge: Homer, that's our wedding photo!
Homer: Marge, quit living in the past.
-- 

  Ned: Heydily-ho, window buddy.  Just wondering if you'd like to come
       over and give the new pool table a whirl.
Homer: I'll be there.  And this time, _you_ can be the Nacho Man.
        [both laugh]
 Lisa: Dad and Ned Flanders next?  Hmph.  What's next, A's on Bart's
       report card?
        [Marge, Lisa, and Bart laugh]
 Bart: [realizes] Hey!
-- Slow reaction time, 

Homer lines up a shot without using the rake, leaning hard on the table
in the process.

  Ned: [uneasy] Uh, be careful there, Homer, that is sort of a new
       table, heh heh, heh.
Homer: Watch this, Ned.  They don't call me "Springfield Fats" just
       because I'm morbidly obese!
        [tables legs break off under Homer's weight]
       _Now_ you've got a lawsuit on your hands.  Just kidding.
-- A bad time for joking, 

Rod and Todd watch a religious kid's cartoon program.

Father sheep: What's wrong, Jeremiah?
    Jeremiah: It's not fair.  My brother Joseph has a sin to confess.  I
              wish I had one too.
Father sheep: Oh, don't you see?  You _do_ have a sin to confess -- the
              sin of envy.
               [sheep baa their laughter]
        Todd: It's all well and good for sheep, but what are we to do?
       Homer: Boring!  Let's watch something else.
    Rod+Todd: Aw...
         Ned: Now, boys, Mr. Simpson is the guest.  He gets to decide
              what to watch.
       Homer: Yeah...
               [Homer flips through channels which all seem to be blank]
              Hey, what gives?  I thought you had a satellite dish.
         Ned: Sure doodily-do.  Over 230 channels locked out!
-- A good investment, 

   Maude: OK, boys, time for bed.  Say good night.
Rod+Todd: Good night, Daddy.  Good night, Uncle Homer.
   Homer: Aw, Uncle Homer.  Ned, since you've let me spend time with
          your family, I want you to get to know _my_ family.
           [they go to Moe's]
          Hey everyone.
  Barney: Hey.
   Homer: I'd like to introduce Ned Flanders, my best friend.
     Moe: Hey, I don't want no one in here with their "evils of alcohol"
          rap.
     Ned: Wait a second: you're the man at the hospital who reads to
          sick children.
           [flashback to Moe reading the end of "My Friend Flicka" and
          sniffling]
     Moe: [grabs Ned] If this gets out, the next words you say will be
          muffled by your own butt.
-- Who woulda thunk it?, 

Homer returns home from work to find Marge working on a flower bed in
front of the house.

Marge: Honey, I'm so glad you're ho --
Homer: Can't talk, seeing Flanders.  Later, sex.
Marge: Hmm...
-- Short and sweet, 

It's dinner time at the Flanders.  Ned says grace.

  Ned: Bless the grocer for this wonderful meat, the middlemen who
       jacked up the price, and let's not forget the humane but
       determined boys over at the slaughterhouse.
        [Homer appears at the window]
Homer: Hiya.  Flanders.  Ooh, dinner!  May I join you?  [climbs in]
        [digs in amidst gasps from the Flanders clan]
  Ned: Homer, I'd love to chitty-chat, but tonight's the night I do my
       charity work.
Homer: Oh yeah, the judge made me do that once too.  Stupid lack of
       public urinals.
-- Much-needed city funds, 

Homer magnanimously offers, "Hey!  Just so you don't have to suffer
alone, I'm coming with you!"  Ned sounds less than enthused about it,
but he doesn't let on too badly.

When they arrive at the homeless shelter, a reverend walks up to Homer
and says, "Oh, you poor unfortunate man.  Let's get you our of those
clothes immediately.  And we'll do whatever we can about the smell."
Homer starts to protest, but stops soon enough.

Homer: Come on!  We've been here for fifteen minutes!  Can't you see
       they're sucking the life out of us?
  Ned: Homer...maybe you'd have more fun at Moe's tonight.
Homer: Aw, for some reason, Moe's always closed on Wednesdays
  Moe: [in a corner, reading] "And then they realized, they were no
       longer little girls: they were little women."  [sniffles]
-- The many lives of Morris the Bartender, 

Homer tries to rush Ned into doling out the soup faster, and in
frustration, grabs the ladle and starts doing it himself at break-neck
speed.  Dave Shutton notices and exclaims, "Wow, look at that
enthusiasm!  This is front-page material."  He snaps a shot which
appears on the front page of the Springfield Shopper the next day.

Marge: Homey, I'm very proud of you, but don't you think you're spending
       too much time with Ned?  Your family needs you too.
Homer: Oh, of _course_ you'd say something like that, Marge.  You've
       hated Ned for years!  In fact, you wanted to bash his head in
       with a pipe.
Marge: That was you!
Homer: Love, Marge.  Don't hate -- love.
-- Back to the sixties for a second, 

 Bart: The Flanders are a bunch of geeks, man.
Homer: The Flandereses are not geeks!  -- OK, Rod and Todd are, and the
       wife has a thing for me, but she hides it behind a mask of low-
       key hostility -- but we've gotta give this thing a chance!  I
       want the two families to take a trip together this weekend.
 Bart: No way, Jose!
Homer: Yes way!
 Lisa: Don't worry, Bart.  It seems like every week something odd
       happens to the Simpsons.  My advice is to ride it out, make the
       occasional smart-alec quip, and by next week we'll be back to
       where we started from, ready for another wacky adventure.
 Bart: Ay, caramba!
 Lisa: That's the spirit.
-- Meta-humor galore, 

{On the drive up, both families are crammed into Ned's station wagon.
Homer consoles, "Don't worry -- I brought my Rappin' Ronnie Reagan tape.
It always makes the trip go faster."  He puts it in, and a Ronald Reagan
sample repeats, "Well, well, weh-weh-well..." Homer laughs, realizing
for the first time that Reagan did in fact say "Well" a lot.}

They arrive at the Lake.  Ned backs the boat trailer into the lake while
Homer guides him.  Homer calls for its release long before it's close to
the water, and it scrapes jarringly along the concrete.  "OK, let's go
boating!" he calls.

On the lake, Ned steers the boat with Homer &amp; Bart, supposedly watching
Todd &amp; Rod water-skiing.  "How are my boys doing, Homer?" asks Ned,
hoping Homer was watching them as they waterskied.  "They're fine," he
answers without looking back.  The handholds skim along the water, no
boys to be seen.

Marge: I hope the children enjoy my special fruit punch.
 Lisa: We got the recipe from the Fruit Punch Advisory Board.
Maude: Oh, gosh, I'm sorry.  Our boys don't eat sugar.
Marge: But why would the Advisory Board give us bad advice?
Maude: No sugar!
        [Marge and Lisa groan]
        [in the woods, in a clearing]
 Todd: Thank you, but we're not allowed.
 Bart: Aw, it's OK.  There's no sugar in Pixie Stix.
        [Rod tries some and his eyes bug out]
  Rod: Don't hog it all, smelly-head.
 Todd: Go to hell, zit face!
        [They roll around fighting for it]
-- What was the root of all evil again?, 

At dinner, Homer raises his glass.

Homer: I'd like to propose a toast to the coming together of the
       Simpsons and Flanders.  If this were a more perfect world, we'd
       all be known as the Flimpsons.  So here's to my best friend, Ned.
  Ned: [sighs] Well, sir...my entire family is very touched --
Homer: Food fight!
        [All the Simpsons get into it while the Flanders just get
       pelted]
Homer: [later] Whatcha doin'?
  Ned: We're heading back.  Todd's got Zesty Italian in his eye.
Homer: Oh, OK.  But at least let me take the boat out for one last spin?
  Ned: Oh, I don't know --
Homer: Too late!
  Ned: [groans] Oh Lord, please give me the strength to endure Homer
       Simpson's friendship?
        [Homer jumps the boat high out of the water right onto Ned's
       car]
Homer: Your car.  [looks at the full parking lot] Boy, what are the
       odds, huh?  [laughs]
-- 

Dr. Hibbert, who is in the parking lot, offers cheers to Homer Simpson
for all his recent charity work.  Everyone cheers.  "Jeers to this rusty
tailgate," he finishes.

Ned walks up a churchtower whistling "Bringing in the Sheaves."  At the
top, he assembles a semi-automatic rifle.  "There's Homer," he says,
shooting at someone in a park, "There's Homer, too.  That's also Homer.
That's also Homer!"  But this latter target is a postal employee, who of
course has his own automatic rifle.  A gunfight breaks out.

       [Ned wakes up, gasping]
Maude: What's the matter, Ned?
  Ned: I...I think I hate Homer Simpson.
        [Homer wakes up, gasping]
Homer: Marge...I think I hate Ted Koppel!  No, wait, I find him
       informative and witty.  'Night.
-- _I'll_ sleep easier, 

[End of Act Two.  Time: 15:55]

As Flanders plays basketball with his kids, Homer appears through the
hedge separating the neighbor's houses.

Homer: Hey!  What's up for today, Neddy?
  Ned: Uh, er, Homer, we're gonna visit the boys' grandmother.  Family
       only, you know?
Homer: Right!  No reporters.
  Ned: No, I, I...I mean just the Flanders family.
Homer: [slowly] Oh, OK.  [goes back through the hedge]
 Todd: Oh boy!  Grandma!
  Ned: We're not goin' anywhere.
 Todd: But you said --
  Ned: Er...sometimes to keep from hurting someone's feelings, you have
       to say things that aren't exactly --
  Rod: Lies make baby Jesus cry.
-- You've been told, 

Homer decides to try again later.  He walks over with two putters and
knocks on Ned's door, entreating him to go to the Pitch'N'Putt.  Just
then, Flanders smashes his car through the garage door, his family along
for the ride.  Homer chases after them, much to Rod and Todd's chagrin.
Maude begs Ned to step on it, but Ned complains, "I can't!  It's a Geo!"

Homer manages to use the putters to latch onto the trunk with the clubs,
and Ned drags him along for a while.  Fortunately, the Flanders turn a
corner sharply, dislodging Homer.  He rolls off, clanking, and as he
comes to rest, he concludes, "I guess he didn't see me."

    Ned: We did it!  We got rid of --
          [siren wails; Ned is pulled over]
    Ned: I told you, officer, I'm not "hepped up on Goofballs."
 Wiggum: [bored] Yeah, right.
          [a church tour bus drives by]
Lovejoy: Ned Flanders!  I never would have imagined.
          [Ned feels weak with shame, then faints]
 Wiggum: High as a kite, everybody!  Goofballs!
          [forces him into the back of the police car]
         Yeah, where's your Messiah now, Flanders?
-- He's hepped up too, 

Sunday.  Ned confesses to weak feelings as his family approaches the
First Church of Springfield.

  Ned: I can't do it, Maude.  I can't face their accusing eyes!
Maude: Oh, don't worry, Ned.  This is a house of love and forgiveness.
        [Ned opens the door]
Crowd: There he is, Ned Flanders!
       The fallen one.
       The evil one.
       Bet he's the one who wrote "Homer" all over the bathroom.
  Ned: Oh, I think we should leave.
Homer: Hey, Flanders, over here!  I got us some kick-ass seats.
-- The shame and humiliation, 

Ned and his family scurry up to the front where Homer has saved them a
pew.

Lovejoy: Before I get started on today's sermon entitled, "What Ned
         Did," I'd like to congratulate Homer Simpsons on his recent
         charity work.
          [everyone claps politely]
  Homer: [kisses audience] I live to give!
Lovejoy: That's beautiful.  We appreciate the kisses.
-- 

Rev. Lovejoy calls for everyone to bow their heads in a silent prayer of
thanksgiving.  Everyone does so.  But Ned can't help but be annoyed by
Homer breathing through his nose, whistling louder and louder.  "Stop
it!"  Flanders cries in anger, "Breathe through your damn mouth!"
Everyone gasps in astonishment.

         Ned: Oh, can't you see this man isn't a hero?  He's annoying.
              He's very, very annoying!
Mrs. Lovejoy: [haughty] Well.  Ned Flanders is just jealous.
         Moe: Aw, the guy's hepped up on Goofballs.
         Abe: Let's sacrifice him to our god!
               [everyone is silent] Come on, we did it all the time in
              the thirties.
-- Paganism in the twentieth century, 

A lynch mob takes little time to form.

  Homer: How dare you talk about Ned Flanders like that.  He's a
         wonderful, kind, caring man -- maybe even more so than me.
         There have been times when I lost patience with him -- even
         lashed out at him!  -- but this man has turned every cheek on
         his body.
         If everyone here were like Ned Flanders, there'd be no need for
         heaven: we'd already be there.
          [everyone seems sympathetic]
Lovejoy: Um...well, I think we all owe Ned a heartfelt apology.  We were
         wrong to doubt him.
  Lenny: Hey, that guy's right!
-- Give 'em hell, Timothy, 

Marge commends Homer on what a nice thing he did.  Ned, too, is
effusively grateful.

  Ned: Thank you so much, Homer.  You're a true friend.
Homer: Right back at you, buddy.  Now how about that game at the
       Pitch'N'Putt?
  Ned: Just try and stop me.
 Bart: I don't get it, Lis.  You said everything would be back to
       normal, but Homer and Flanders are still friends.
 Lisa: Yeah.  Maybe this means the end of our wacky adventures.
        ["Next Thursday at 8:00pm"]
Homer: Guess what, everybody?  My great uncle Boris died and left us his
       old country house!  There's only one catch: they say it's
       haunted.  But I'm sure we can prove 'em wrong by spending the
       weekend there.
  Ned: Hi-diddely-ho, neighbor!
Homer: Get lost, Flanders.
  Ned: Okily dokily.
        [Bart and Lisa sigh]
-- Back to normal at last, 

Homer scoffs, "See?  I told you there's nothing to worry about.  This
place isn't --" but he's cut off by the family screaming.

 EPISODE TITLE: Bart Gets an Elephant


EPISODE SUMMARY: 
[Syndication cuts are marked in curly braces "{}" and are courtesy of
Ricardo Lafaurie and Frederic Briere.]

It's another delicate morning in Springfield, USA.  Marge trudges out of
bed and walks down the stairs, amidst a minefield of junk the other
members of the family have left lying around.  "Mmm," she grumbles,
"Sandwich," stepping on one.  Further down the stairs, she notices some
underpants draped over the railing.

The kitchen, too, is a disaster area.  Eggs are smashed on the wall;
pizza drips gooily from the ceiling.  Checking in the fridge, Marge
finds Homer's bowling ball -- and some more underpants.  Still, she
prepares breakfast for the family without complaining.

Homer, Lisa, and Bart walk in with a cheery, "Hi Mom!", and tuck into
the breakfast Marge has kindly prepared.

 Bart: After breakfast, me and Milhouse are going down to the ravine.
       We got a tip from a six-year-old that there's a dead Martian down
       there.
 Lisa: And I'm going to the park to jam with "The Little White Girls
       Blues Quartet."  Wanna come with me, Daddy-O?
Homer: I'd love to, honey, but Daddy has to go to a beer-drinking
       contest today.
 Bart: Think you'll win?
Homer: Son, when you participate in sporting events, it's not whether
       you win or lose: it's how drunk you get.
 Bart: Gotcha.
-- The wisdom of age, 

"Well, gotta go!" says Bart, getting up to leave.  Homer and Lisa do the
same.  Marge, however, blocks the doorway.

 Bart: Uh, it's hard for us to leave when you're standing there, Mom.
Homer: [cheery] Push her down, son.
-- 

"No one's going anywhere!"  Marge begins angrily.  "We're going to clean
the whole house from top to bottom," she says, handing out buckets and
mops all around.  "Oh dear God, no!" cries Homer, and in a panic, Bart
runs to the front door and grasps it frantically, trying to get out.
Marge warns him that escape is impossible.

    Marge: Now each one of you take a floor and get started.
    Homer: I call the basement!
Bart+Lisa: Fine.
    Homer: [questioningly] D'oh?
            [Turns on the light in the basement, sees the huge mess]
           D'oh!
-- The cleaning spree begins, 

Bart wipes lamely away at the coffee table in the living room.

 Bart: [whining] I'm tired.  I'm hungry.  Can't we just buy a new house?
Marge: Oh, Bart, cleaning doesn't have to be a chore!  Here, work to the
       music.  [turns on the radio]
Ernie: You load sixteen tons, what do you get?
       Another day older and deeper in debt...
 Bart: Amen, Ernie.
-- Apt cleaning-music, 

In the basement, Homer wears a back-pack with an air compressor in it.
He pulls the chain to start it, and blows all the papers on the floor
into a swirling vortex.  Paper is strewn everywhere when he shuts it
down and dusts his hands.

 Homer: All done.
 Marge: You're not done.  I want you to throw away these old calendars
        and TV Guides.
 Homer: Are you mad, woman?  You never know when an old calendar might
        come in handy.  Sure, it's not 1985 now, but who knows what
        tomorrow will bring?  And these TV Guides: [fondly] so many
        memories.
         [opens one] "Gomer upsets Sergeant Carter"...oh, I'll never
        forget that episode.
         [imagines]
Carter: [annoyed] Pyle!
 Gomer: Shazam!
Carter: Pyle!
 Gomer: Shazam!
Carter: Pyle!
 Gomer: Shazam!
 Homer: Heh heh heh...Shazam.
-- Homer "cleans" the basement, 

Marge chides Homer for wasting time.

Marge: Stop remembering TV and get back to work!
Homer: What's the point of all this cleaning?  Are we so vain?!
-- Apparently, yes, 

In her room, Lisa vacuums under the bed.  She hears music from outside.
Looks as though the Little White Girls have decided to do a tour while
they play.  Even better, President Clinton follows them, jamming on his
saxophone.  Moe drives by, scolding, "Hey, Clinton!  Get back to work!",
to which Bill retorts, "Make me!"  Lisa rues the great time they're
having while she's stuck inside; the vacuum cleaner she holds sucks into
her saxophone, making a sound like derisive laughter.

{In the basement, Homer prepares to clean the floor.}

       Homer: {[reads label on the Mr. Cleanser bottle]
              Hmm..."Use only in a well-ventilated area."  Shove it,
              buddy!
               [pours some out, starts scrubbing] Ooh...
               [the fumes get to him, and the logos on the cleansers
              come alive and look at him evilly]
              Huh?
               [the creatures all jump him]}
Mr. Cleanser: {[in a Russian accent] I must destroy you!}
       Homer: {Aah!  Aah!  Aah!}
       Marge: {Homer!  What's going on down there?}
       Homer: {Nothing.}
       Marge: {Then stop screaming so loud!}
       Homer: {OK...oh.  Oh.  Oh.}
-- Pointless warning labels, 

In the front room, Bart scrubs dust off Grant Wood's "American Gothic"
with KBBL blaring its inane chatter in the background.

       
        [song finishes]
 Bart: [groans]
Marty: And that was "Take This Job and Shove It."  Now let's make
       another one of our lucky phone calls --
 Bill: OK, just answer the phone with the special phrase that pays and
       you'll have your choice of $10,000 in cash --
        [cash register bell sounds]
       -- or a really stuuupid prize.
        [cuckoo clock chimes]
        [goofy laughter]
Marty: Well, let's make that call.
        [phone next to Bart rings]
 Bart: KBBL's going to give me something stupid!
  Abe: Bart, I'm having palpitations!
 Bart: Can't tie up the line, Grampa.  [hangs up]
-- And you didn't call 911 because...?, 

Finally, the arduous task is complete.  Bart, Lisa, and Homer all look
tattered and tired.  "There," consoles Marge, "isn't that a lot better?
Now you can do whatever you want, but don't mess up the house."  The
three respond, "We won't," and they wander into the kitchen.  As the
door swings closed and then open again, the kitchen changes from
spotless to a total mess.

 Marty: Now let's try another lucky phone call.
         [phone rings]
Wiggum: Help!  Help us!  They stole our uniforms, guns, and tasers!
 Snake: [wearing a police uniform] Fry, piggy.  [charges taser]
Wiggum: No, no -- no don't -- aargh!
        Aargh!
        A little to the left...
        Ah, that's the stuff.
  Bill: Oh, I'm sorry.  The phrase is, "KBBL is going to give me
        something stupid."  Pretty weird, hyuck, hyuck.  ["sproing"
        noise]
-- It's probably just a joke, 

Marty: Let's try one more number.
Homer: Y'ello?
 Bart: [grabs phone] KBBL is going to give me something stupid!
Marty: Well, hot dog!  We have a weiner!  [car alarm noise]
Homer: [grasping air] Y'ello?
 Bart: I won, I won!
Marty: You win your choice of $10,000 or -- what's our gag prize this
       week, Bill?
 Bill: [raucous] A full-grown African Elephant!
 Bart: Well, all that money sounds mighty tempting, Marty, but I think
       I'm going to have to go with the elephant.
Homer: [to Marge, happily] He's taking the elephant instead of the
       money.
Marty: [whispering] The kid wants the elephant!
 Bill: We don't have an damn elephant.
Marty: Don't whisper into the mike!
 Bill: Ahem, kid, the elephant's a gag prize.  Nobody takes the gag
       prize.  [nervous laughter] You want the cash.
 Bart: [indignant] I want the elephant!
Homer: Heh, heh, stick it to the man!
-- Homer, forever anti-authority, 

Reason rears its ugly head, however, and Homer tries to convince Bart to
take the money instead.

Homer: Bart!  With $10,000, we'd be millionaires!  We could buy all
       kinds of useful things like...love!
Marge: Or double-ply windows.  They look just like regular windows but
       they'll save us 4% on our heating bill.
        [long pause]
       Well they will.
 Lisa: You all seem to be forgetting the most important thing...which is
       that it's wrong to imprison an animal!
        [long pause]
Homer: Lisa, go to you room.
-- Homer deals with opposition, 

Bart &amp; Homer arrive at KBBL, where Bart demands his elephant.

Marty: [sheepish laughter] We appreciate you coming down, but, heh, look
       kid, the thing us, uh heh heh...we don't _have_ an elephant, heh
       heh.
 Bill: Come on, kid: just take the money, huh?  Otherwise we might get
       fired.  You don't want us to get fired, do you?
 Bart: Ehh, either way.
        [the DJs gasp]
-- The cruelty of ten-year-olds, 

  Marty: We think we know how your mind works, Bart.  So how about this:
         we pay your principal $10,000 to pull down his pants and keep
         them down for the rest of the school year, ha ha!
Skinner: I'll do it, Bart.
   Bart: Ermmm...no.
   Bill: OK, OK...what if we use the $10,000 to, er, surgically
         transform Skinner here into, er...some kind of a lobster-like
         creature?
Skinner: Now wait just a minute: that wasn't discussed with me.
-- Going over his head, 

Bart is inexorable: "Uh, Gentlemen, I am not leaving without my
elephant."  But he and Homer are both tossed out anyway.  "Where's my
elephant?"  Bart demands at the window repeatedly.  The DJs close the
window, but over the song they play next, Bart's queries can still be
heard faintly.  At the Springfield Retirement Castle, Abe notes, "Hey,
they're playing the elephant song!"  Jasper loves that; it reminds him
of elephants.  Kent Brockman even editorializes, "So isn't that what
we're all asking in our own lives -- 'where's my elephant?'  I know
that's what I've been asking."

At the KBBL studios, Bill and Marty's boss gives them a dressing-down.

   Boss: Look, our ratings are down, and the station is being swamped
         with angry calls and letter-bombs.
          [A few letter-bombs explode in a pile]
         And it's all your fault!
   Bill: Yes it is, ma'am.
   Boss: This is the DJ 3000.  It plays CDs automatically, and it has
         three distinct varieties of inane chatter.
          [presses a button]
DJ 3000: [stilted] Hey, hey.  How about that weather out there?
         Woah!  _That_ was the caller from hell.
         Well, hot dog!  We have a weiner.
   Bill: Man, that thing's great!
  Marty: _Don't_ praise the machine!
   Boss: If you don't get that kid an elephant by tomorrow, the DJ 3000
         gets your job.
          [Marty punches it]
DJ 3000: Those clowns in congress did it again.  What a bunch of clowns.
   Bill: [laughs] How does it keep up with the news like that?
-- Misplaced admiration, 

Next morning, Marge hears the doorbell.  She rushes downstairs and pulls
the dinning room curtains open.  She's greeted by a large, staring eye.
Bill and Marty drive off as the family check out the elephant left them.
"Woah!"  Bart cries happily, and the elephant trumpets savagely.
Santa's Little Helper and Snowball II scamper off in fright.  They pause
on the horizon, peeking over, and whisk out of sight when the elephant
trumpets again.

[End of Act One.  Time: 8:13]

The elephant makes grunting noises and a ferocious face.

Marge: Homer...it looks like it could gore.
Homer: Heh heh...it _does_ look like Al Gore.
 Bart: [admiring] Ew, he smells worse than anything.  Hey you, elephant!
       Lift me up on your back, man.
        [elephant stuffs him in its mouth]
Marge: Bart!
        [Bart gets out with a plop]
 Bart: [nervous laughter] He tried to kill me.
-- Examining the elephant, 

Marge: I really think this is a bad idea.
Homer: Marge, I agree with you -- in theory.  In theory, communism
       works.  In theory.
-- Pros and cons of keeping the elephant, 

Just then, the elephant walks towards the side of the house and rubs up
against it to scratch himself, tearing the outside layer of the house
off.  "Look," laughs Bart, "he thinks he's people."

Homer decides to chain the elephant to a tree in the backyard.  Not
liking the idea, the elephant angrily breaks his chain and stomps on a
few Simpson items.  Bart decides to call the elephant "Stampy".

       [Stampy trumpets]
Homer: What's he yelling about?
 Lisa: He's hungry.  Here you go Stampy: [holds a platter] eat it slow.
       It has to last for --
        [Stampy grabs it all at once]
       You ate it too fast.
Homer: Maybe if we tied it down so it couldn't move it wouldn't get so
       hungry.
 Lisa: You can't do that, Dad, it's cruel!
Homer: Oh, everything's cruel according to you.  Keeping him chained up
       in the back yard is cruel.  Pulling on his tail is cruel.
       Yelling in his ears is cruel.  Everything is cruel.  Well, excuse
       me if I'm cruel!
        [Stampy stuffs Homer in his mouth; Homer struggles out]
       Now I've had my head in an elephant, a hippo, and a giant sloth.
-- Three for impressive three, 

To solve the food problem, Homer takes Stampy to Moe's for the "Free
Peanuts."  But Moe warns, "I think you're taking unfair advantage of my
generous offer."  Homer tells him to shut up.

       [Stampy lies weakly on the ground]
 Lisa: He can't just eat peanuts, Dad, he needs plants to live.
Homer: [crafty] Plants, eh?
        [At the Springfield Arboretum "(Tree place)"]
 Bart: Strip the bark now, Stampy.
Homer: Hey: any more arboretums around here?
  Man: No!
-- Too much of a good thing, 

{Just then, a bird lands on Stampy's back and starts to peck.}

Homer: {That bird!  He's killing the elephant.  Stop him!}
 Lisa: {No, Dad, he's grooming him.}
Homer: {[crafty] Grooming him, eh?
        [later, at home]}
Marge: {Ooh, Homer, there's a bird on your head!}
Homer: {I know.  He's grooming me.  Mmm...elephant fresh.}
-- Fresh as you can get, 

Stampy has no problem quieting the neighborhood dogs at night: one might
trumpet, and the dogs shut up.  Just as well, because it makes it easier
for Bart to sleep out in the tree fort.  "Good night, Stampy," he calls,
and the elephant pulls Bart's covers over him.  He then caresses Bart's
head with his trunk and wraps it around Bart as if to hug him.  Just as
Bart gets comfortable, Stampy yanks him out and stuffs him in his mouth.
Bart taps on his cheek, and Stampy puts him back in his sleeping bag,
covered with drool.  "Thanks, bud.  'Preciate it."

 Lisa: Taught Stampy any tricks yet, Bart?
 Bart: Nah.  He doesn't want to learn, and I don't want to teach him.
       We get along fine.
        [SLH and S II walk by, balancing on balls]
Homer: Hey, what's with them?
 Lisa: I think they're trying to get some attention.
Homer: Oh.  Good luck!
-- 

Homer: Look at these bills: chains for elephant.  Shots for elephant.
       -- "Oversized decorative poncho"?!
 Bart: Technically it's for a giraffe, but I think I can let it out a
       little.
Homer: Well these bills will have to paid out of your allowance.
 Bart: You'll have to raise my allowance to about $1000 a week.
Homer: Then that's what I'll do, smart guy.
        [doorbell rings]
 Girl: Can we see the elephant?
  Boy: We'll pay you money...
Homer: For the ninth time, no!
        [slams door; doorbell rings again]
       Wait a minute...this gives me an idea.
        [hammers a "Go away" sign into the ground outside]
 Bart: Uh, here's a better sign, Dad.
        ["See the elephant, $1.  Ride the elephant, $2"]
Homer: I don't have time to read it.  Just give me the gist of it, son.
-- Well, OK, 

What a success Bart's idea becomes.  The yard is full of people who want
to see and ride the elephant.  One child is tossed angrily away by
Stampy, and Homer wants to charge his mother for the five-foot ride.

Mrs. Lovejoy: That animal of yours is certainly bad-tempered.
        Lisa: Yeah, well you'd be grumpy too if you were taken out of
              your natural habitat and gawked at by a bunch of slack-
              jawed yokels.
         Man: Hey, Moe: look at that pointy-hairded little girl.  Hyuck.
-- Slack-jawed, indeed, 

Bart feels that he and Stampy are misunderstood.  Mr. Burns reminisces
to Smithers how riding Stampy reminds him of the fat man he used to ride
to work.

Homer: Look at this, Marge: $58 and all of it profit!  I'm the smartest
       businessman in the world.
Marge: Stampy's food bill today was $300.
Homer: Marge, please, don't humiliate me in front of the money.
-- A fate worse than death, 

Homer decides to up the prices -- to $100 for a view and $500 for a
ride.  Everyone can't leave quickly enough.

          Homer: Uh, Milhouse saw the elephant twice and rode him once,
                 right?
Mrs. Van Houten: Yes, but we paid you $4.
          Homer: Well, that was under our old price structure.  Under
                 our new price structure, your bill comes to a total of
                 $700.  Now, you've already paid me $4, so that's just
                 $696 more that you owe me.
 Mr. Van Houten: Get off our property.
-- So much for that idea, 

Homer finally realizes that they can't afford to keep the elephant.
When he suggests selling him, Bart is against it.  SLH and S II play
"Mary Had a Little Lamb" on the toy piano in the background.

  Man: Well, sir, I'll be honest with you: I need a large African
       elephant and I need it today.  But I'm afraid this just isn't
       what I'm looking for.
Homer: What do you mea?  It's an elephant, isn't it?
  Man: Well, it is, and it isn't.  If you understand what I mean.
Homer: [pause]
        [happily] He likes peanuts.
-- A good selling-point, 

Warden: Our wildlife refuge is the ideal environment for your elephant:
        thousands of acres of simulated African savannah.
  Lisa: It's perfect, Dad.
 Homer: I only have two questions: "How much", and "Give it to me".
Warden: Well, we really can't offer you any money, we're a non-profit
        organization.
 Homer: So your bid is zero.
Warden: Well, we like to think of it as --
 Homer: Thank you.
Warden: You know I really think --
 Homer: Thank you.
-- Zero don't pay the bills, 

Blackheart: Mr. Simpson, I think you'll find this amount more than fair.
      Lisa: Dad, I think he's an ivory dealer!  His boots are ivory, his
            hat is ivory, and I'm pretty sure that check is ivory.
     Homer: Lisa, a guy who's got lots of ivory is _less_ likely to hurt
            Stampy than a guy whose ivory supplies are low.
       SLH: [growling] We...love...you.
      Lisa: Mr. Blackheart?
Blackheart: Yes, my pretty?
      Lisa: Are you an ivory dealer?
Blackheart: [laughs] Well, little girl, I've had lots of jobs in my day:
            whale-hunter, seal-clubber, president of the Fox network,
            and, like most people, yeah, I've dealt a little ivory.
      Bart: Dad, you can't do this.  Stampy is my friend.
     Homer: Don't worry, son.  I'll get you a new elephant.
Blackheart: I'll take that one too.
     Homer: Done.
-- Let's make a deal, 

Blackheart: All right, I'll be back in the morning to pick up Stampy.
     Homer: Here's the keys.
Blackheart: Elephants don't have keys.
     Homer: Well, I'll just keep these then.
-- Little-known facts, 

 Bart: Don't worry, Stampy.  I won't let Homer sell you to that ivory
       dealer.  You and I are going to run away together.  We'll keep to
       the back roads and make our way south.  Then, if I know my
       geography, it's just twelve miles to Africa.  OK, bud, very
       quietly: let's just sneak through --
        [Stampy brushes him off and tromps off]
       Stampy!
        [walks through the Flanders' yard]
  Ned: [gasps] It's the four elephants of the apocalypse!
Maude: That's horsemen, Ned.
  Ned: Well, getting closer.
-- Elephants, horsemen...what's the difference?, 

[End of Act Two.  Time: 15:54]

Lisa runs into her parents' bedroom, clearly distraught.

 Lisa: Mom!  Dad!  Bart and Stampy are gone!
Marge: Oh my Lord!
 Lisa: I bet it's 'cause of that horrible ivory dealer, [accusing]
       _Dad_.
Homer: That wasn't part of our deal, Blackheart.  That wasn't part!
        [drives off looking]
       Piece of cake!  All we have to do is follow the path of
       destruction.
        [looks up]
       Oh, stupid tornado!  [laughs] Look!  It got Patty and Selma.
        [the two sit in rocking chairs up in the air]
Patty: Hmm.  I feel it all the way up my skirt.
Selma: Ditto.
-- That's one powerful gale, 

{Two workmen carry a pane of glass across the road.  Stampy crashes
towards them, and they hastily move out of the way into the other lane,
where they have to move quickly _again_ to avoid Bart on his skateboard.
Having saved the glass from destruction, they toss it carlessly into a
recycling bin.}

Chief Wiggum takes calls down at the station.

Yeah, right, lady: an elephant ran through your front yard.  OK.
 [goes to another line]
Wiggum...yeah, right, mister, mm hm.  An elephant just knocked over your
mailbox.  OK.
 [goes to another line]
Wiggum...Yeah, right, buddy, liquor store robbery, officer down.  Sure.
And I'm Edward G. Robinson.
-- You were last week to Flanders, 

{Stampy walks through a Republican and a Democratic convention even.
The Rublicans cheer him, and the Democrats hoo him.}  He then walks
menacingly towards a peanut factory.  The plant supervisor bolts the
door, then starts to preach about how fortunate everyone is that he
prepared them for this day -- but he's interrupted by Stampy smashing
down the door.

Bart can't find Stampy anywhere.  He calls out for him, and is delighted
to hear a trumpet in return.  He looks over and sees the shadow of an
elephant behind some bushes, but when he runs through them, he finds
it's just the preserved skeleton of a wooly mammoth that wandered into
the Springfield tar pits.  The trumpeting was a recording.

Bart is sure Stampy's gone forever, but just then he hears Stampy's
distinctive call, and he looks over.  It's Stampy, all right.  But his
trunk reaches fondly towards the mammoth skeleton, and the plucky ten-
year-old realizes Stampy pines for company from other elephants.

Just then, Homer, Marge, and Lisa arrive in the car.

       [Homer drives into a preserved deer statue]
Homer: D'oh!
 Lisa: A deer!
Marge: A _female_ deer...
-- The best Simpsons gag ever, 

Homer: Son!  You're OK.  [hypnotic] And you led us to the precious
       ivory...[affable] and, of course, your lovable pet, who it's
       connected to.
 Bart: Dad, I can't let you sell him.  Stampy and I are friends.
        [Stampy beats him with his trunk] Ow!  Anyway, I want him to go
       to that animal refuge.
Homer: Forget it!  That elephant cost me thousands of dollars.
 Lisa: Dad, how would _you_ like to be sold to an ivory dealer?
Homer: I'd like it fine.
 Bart: Even if he killed you and made your teeth into piano keys?
Homer: Yes, of course I would!  Who wouldn't like that -- to be part of
       the music scene?
-- The difference between involvement and commitment, "Bart Gets an
    Elephant"

 Lisa: Dad!  You're sinking.
Homer: Huh?
Marge: Get a rope, Bart?
Homer: Naw, that's OK.  I'm pretty sure I can struggle my way out.
       First I'll just reach in and pull my legs out, now I'll pull my
       arms out with my face.
-- Homer at the Springfield tar pits, 

Homer begins sinking, and Bart implores Stampy to pull him out with his
trunk.  Stampy reaches in and finds Barney, who walks away with a,
"Thanks, Stampy!"  He lights a cigar and catches on fire.

       [Stampy pulls Homer from the tar pit]
Homer: I'm alive.  I'm alive!  And I owe it all to this feisty feline.
 Lisa: Dad, "feline" means "cat".
Homer: Elephant, honey.  It's an elephant!
-- Well, duh, 

"And I'm sure he'll make a grand piano," Homer continues, but Bart and
Lisa castigate him: "Dad!"

Homer: I guess it wouldn't be right to sell Stampy after he saved my
       life.  And the boy seems to have some sort of relationship with
       him.
 Bart: Thanks, Dad.
Homer: On the other hand, who's to say what's right these days, what
       with all our modern ideas...and products?
        [Bart and Lisa look angrily at him]
       All right, we'll give the stupid elephant to the stupid animal
       refuge.
 Kids: Yay!  [hug Homer]
 Bart: Uh, Mom?  We're stuck to Dad.
Marge: Mmm, this is just what happened at the caramel factory.
        [pulls them off]
 Lisa: Ow, my hair!
Homer: Mmm, caramel.
-- We don't want to know, 

Bart bids a tearful goodbye to Stampy outside the animal refuge.  Stampy
reaches for him and Bart cringes, expecting to be put in his mouth once
again, but instead Stampy lifts him on his back.  The elephant runs into
the pasture, spilling Bart off, and starts butting another elephant.
"Attaboy, Stampy!  Butt him once for me!"

        [Stampy butts another elephant]
 Marge: Gosh, I thought he'd be happier in his true habitat.
Warden: Oh, I think he is.
 Marge: Then why is he attacking all those other elephants?
Warden: Well, animals are not like people, Mrs. Simpson.  Some of them
        act badly because they've had a hard life, or have been
        mistreated...but, like people, some of them are just jerks.
        Stop that, Mr. Simpson.
         [Homer butts the warden repeatedly]
-- "Jerk" about sums it up,

 EPISODE TITLE: Burns' Heir


EPISODE SUMMARY: 
[Syndication cuts are marked in curly braces "{}" and are courtesy of
Ricardo Lafaurie and Frederic Briere.]

It's another day at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant.  Homer sits
idly at his work station, rolling a donut morosely back and forth.

Homer: [sighs] Lousy job.  Nothing exciting ever happens.
        [A fanfare plays; an emcee and a scantily clad woman appear]
Emcee: Congratulations, Homer Simpson!  You've just won the employee
       raffle.
Homer: Woo hoo!  What do I get?
Emcee: The job of industrial chimney sweep.
        [Silence; a "BIG WINNER!" sign flashes in the background]
Homer: Woo hoo!
-- Delayed reaction, 

The job consists of being strung from a crane with batting wrapped
around oneself and dipped into tall smokestacks.  Homer is pulled from
the chimney coughing from the soot -- "Hey!  This isn't such a great
prize" -- but he consoles himself with the fact that the big guys at the
top work even harder.

Cut to Mr. Burns sitting in his bathtub watching Homer on TV.  Burns
sports a top hat and cigar; an open bag of extra fancy potato chips
rests on a stool next to him.  Munching on a chip, he sighs, "Will five
o'clock _never_ come?"

   Burns: Careful, Smithers!  That sponge has corners, you know.
Smithers: I'll go find a spherical one, sir.
-- Mr. Burns takes a bath, 

Smithers leaves, putting the sponge on Mr. Burns' hat.  The weight of it
is too much for the feeble Burns, and he sinks slowly into the bath
water.  Fearing his death, his life flashes before his eyes.  A baby
Monty drinks from a bottle in a nanny's arms, but the milk is not to his
liking, and in a fit of pique, he fires her.  As a young man, Burns
shoots a gun at another man's feet, telling him, "Dance!"  The man does
so briefly, then stops while Burns reloads.

Man 1: All right!  We're finally going to stop those corporate pigs from
       dumping that nuclear waste!
Man 2: Oh, no!  Our boat is sinking!
Burns: It was I, you fools!  The man you trusted wasn't Wavy Gravy at
       all!  [tosses a guitar away] And all this time, I've been smoking
       harmless tobacco.
-- Burns foils Greenpeace, 

Wavy Burns jumps off the boat, pulls the cord to inflate his life
jacket, and swims off cackling.

Smithers returns to the bathroom.

Smithers: I got a mink chamois, sir, I hope it -- Oh my God!  Mr. Burns
          is dead!  [sobs] Why do the good always die so young?
   Burns: [rising from the water] You almost killed me!  [strangles him]
Smithers: Please...sir...[wraps a towel around him] You'll catch...
          cold...
-- Devotion to duty, 

Later, Mr. Burns sits in front of the fire tended by Smithers.

   Burns: Smithers, do you realize if I had died, there would be no one
          to carry on my legacy.  Due to my hectic schedule and
          lethargic sperm, I never fathered an heir.  Now I have no one
          to leave my enormous fortune to.  No one.
Smithers: Ahem --
   Burns: You, Smithers?  Oh no, my dear friend.  I've planned a far
          greater reward for you.  When I pass on, you shall be buried
          alive with me.  [Opens a miniature coffin containing dead
          Burns and aghast Smithers]
Smithers: Oh...goody.
-- Contagious enthusiasm, 

The next scene is at a movie theater where "Siskel and Ebert: The Movie"
is playing.  The movie begins with a promo for THX sound which is
powerful enough to shatter Hans Moleman's glasses, break a man's teeth,
make an exit sign explode, pull plaster from the ceiling, and cause a
man's head to explode.  Everyone cheers anyway, except for Abe, who
calls, "Turn it up!  Turn it up!"

Instead of previews, Mr. Burns is shown in a large green field.

Burns: Hello, I'm Montgomery Burns.
Homer: Aah!
Burns: Now then, I'm looking for a suitable young male heir to leave my
       fortune to when I pass away -- my vast, vast, _vast_ fortune.
       Vast.
        [audience chatters]
Burns: Auditions will be tomorrow at my estate.  And now, our feature
       presentation!  [whispering from off camera]
       Oh, for -- oh, very well.  ["For He's a Jolly Good Fellow"
       starts]
        [sings] Let's all go to the lobby,
       Let's all go to the lobby,
       Let's all go to the lobby,
       Get ourselves some snacks.
-- Shameless plugs for popcorn, 

The next night, at Burns' estate, every young boy in Springfield is
there with his parents, including Martin, Milhouse, Ralph, and Bart.  In
his private auditorium, Mr. Burns sits in a row by himself, the
illustrious Smithers holding a clipboard behind him.  First up on the
tryout list is Milhouse.

Milhouse: I have nothing to offer you but my love.
   Burns: I specifically said, no geeks!
Milhouse: But my mom says I'm cool...
   Burns: Next!
  Nelson: Gimme your fortune or I'll pound your withered old face in!
   Burns: Oh, I like his energy.  Put him on the callback list.
  Martin: [walks out as music begins]
          Clang, clang, clang went the trolley!
          Ring, ring, ring went the bell!
          Zing, zing, zing went my heartstrings -- oof!  [Nelson belts
          him]
   Burns: Thank you!  Give the bully an extra point.
-- The tryouts begin, 

    Lisa: [clears throat] I propose to you that your heir not need be a
          boy.  In this phallocentric society of ours --
   Burns: Er, I don't know what phallocentric means, but no girls!
Milhouse: [offstage, in drag] So much for Plan B.
-- Lousy four-syllable words, 

Next up is Bart.

Homer: That's it, boy: you're our last hope.
 Bart: Aw, I just don't want to be here, Dad.  Besides, I started a fire
       this morning that I really should keep an eye on.
-- Bart gets cold feet, 

Marge tries to steel his courage by reminding him that he'll have his
whole future provided for.  In her imagination, Bart walks across the
stage at Harvard to receive his diploma.  Marge watches proudly from the
audience until Lee Majors approaches her and asks her to come away with
him.  She readily agrees, and he carries her in his arms and leaps
bionically into the air.  Back in reality, Marge thinks she should stop
fantasizing about the bionic man, but says, "Ehh, one more."

Homer: OK, boy, I wrote down exactly what to say.  Just read it and
       you're a shoo-in!
 Bart: [walks onstage, squints at cue cards] Hello, Mr. ...Kurns.  I bad
       want...money now.  Me sick.
Homer: Ooh, he card-reads good.
 Bart: So pick please me, Mr. Burns.
Homer: {[calling from offstage] It's "Kurns", stupid!}
Marge: {No it's not!}
Homer: {Disregard.}
-- 

Burns is so frustrated at Bart's incompetence that he orders everyone
out except for Bart, who he orders one step to the left.  Bart complies,
only to have Burns turn some giant wheels to manipulate a boot to kick
him.  Homer can't contain his mirth -- "The boot kicked Bart!  It kicked
him right in the butt!" he laughs.

As the family walk down the driveway afterwards, Marge observes her
children's melancholy.

Marge: I think Bart and Lisa are feeling a little upset right now.
       Isn't there something you'd like to say?
Homer: There sure is.  Kids, you tried your best, and you failed
       miserably.  The lesson is, never try.  Heh heh heh -- right in
       the butt.  That was great.
-- A one-track mind, 

Burns, too, is dejected.  He sits in his office to mull things over.

   Burns: It's no use.  I guess I'll have to leave all my money to the
          Egg Advisory Council.  Eggs have gotten quite a bad rap
          lately, you know, Smithers.
           [A rock crashes through the window]
          Ooh, look!  A bird has become petrified and lost its sense of
          direction.
Smithers: I think it's a rock, sir.
   Burns: We'll see what the lab has to say about _that_.
-- Rock, petrified bird...what's the difference?, 

Another petrified bird joins the first.  The two men go over to the
window to look for the flock, but instead they see Bart smashing windows
with reckless abandon.  "Why, that rapscallion is breaking all my
windows!" observes Burns.  And that's not all -- Bart wraps a loop of
hose around some statues' heads, puts the nozzle in a car, and turns the
water on, thereby popping the heads right off _and_ flooding the car.
To add insult to injury, Bart removes the "No Solicitors" sign from
Burns' gate; the results are immediate.

Burns: Heh heh, look, Smithers -- a creature of pure malevolence.  He's
       the perfect one to suckle at my proverbial teat.  [opens window]
       You there, boy!  What day is this?
  Boy: [cockney accent] Today?  Sir, why, it's Christmas Day!
Burns: I was talking to _him_.  You!  What day is this?
 Bart: Huh?
Burns: I'll tell you what day this is: today is the day you become my
       heir!
        [Bart throws a rock which hits Smithers in the head]
       Ooh, I like him a _lot_.
-- 

[End of Act One.  Time: 7:56]

Homer signs the legal documents to make Bart Mr.  in the
Simpson dining room as reporters look on.

Burns: Just sign here, and your son will stand to inherit my entire
       estate.
Homer: Woo hoo!  We're rich!  Bart, get over to the mansion and open up
       all the windows.  We want to get the old people smell out before
       we move in.
 Lisa: Dad, Mr. Burns hasn't passed away yet.
Homer: Huh?  Oh, right.  So, I guess you're in OK shape, huh?  No heart
       problems or anything?
Burns: Well I --
Homer: Boo!
        [Abe collapses, struggling and groaning]
  Abe: [from the floor] I'm OK!
-- One way to find out, 

Burns leaves; the family see him off.

 Bart: Now that you've agreed to reap the windfall of my death, I must
       return to my large, empty mansion to rattle around and await the
       inevitable -- alone.
Marge: Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
Homer: Yeah.  Let's push him down the steps.
-- That's not it, 

Marge: Bart, since he is giving you all of his money, maybe it would be
       nice if you'd spend some time with him.
 Bart: Well...
Marge: Come on, honey.
 Bart: All right.
Homer: Aw, how come Bart gets to do that and I can't spend one night
       lurking in the bushes outside Chef Boy-Ar-Dee's house?
-- Just because, OK?, 

Bart goes over for dinner.  He sits at one end of a long table while
Monty sits at the other.

Burns: Bart, I know you children see me as some sort of "booger man",
       but I'm really not such a bad dude.  Oh, your milk's gone cold --
       I'll ring for the maid.
        [pushes a button; metal bars spring out around Bart's jaw and
       wrists]
       Oh, sorry -- wrong button.
 Bart: Uh...I think I'd like to go home.
Burns: Oh, this day, you can have anything you want to eat.  Even...some
       sort of gelatin dish.  It's made from hooves, you know.
-- Now _there's_ an appetizing thought, 

Bart asks for pizza delivered by Krusty the Klown.  Burns makes it so --
Krusty walks in with a pizza, then demands his $400.  Bart wonders how
Krusty can be on TV live and be delivering a pizza at the same time, and
Krusty tells him they just play a rerun, assuring him no one will no the
difference.  Too bad the rerun was the one from when the Falkland
Islands were invaded.

{Bart decides to stick around after dinner, and Burns takes him into a
room with lots of TVs.  Burns explains he has hidden cameras in every
home in Springfield.  "I got the idea from that movie 'Sliver' -- what a
delightful romp!"  He flips a switch, and the TVs light up.}

{One shows Moe talking to himself in a mirror, wearing fatigues.  "Are
you talking to me?  There's no one else here -- you _must_ be talking to
me!"  A gun in a spring-clip whizzes up his sleeve and smashes the
mirror.  Moe laments the destruction of his antique.}

{Another screen shows Homer sneaking into the bathroom, locking the
door, and eating the heads off flowers.  "So _that_ explains his
mysterious trip to Holland," Bart concludes.}

At home that night, Bart describes his evening to his family.

Bart: And I had the greatest time!  Mr. Burns' house has everything -- a
      hedge-maze, a moat, bleached hardwood floors, and a bottomless
      pit.
Lisa: It couldn't possibly be bottomless.
Bart: Well, for all intents and purposes.
-- Intents and purposes such as?, 

The next day, at dinner, Bart is up to his usual antics.

       [Bart flicks a pea at Lisa]
 Lisa: Hey!  Mom!  Bart's throwing peas.
Marge: Bart, don't throw peas at your sister.
 Bart: Mr. Burns throws peas at Smithers.  [flicks another]
 Lisa: Ow!  That was a big one!
Marge: Homer, say something.
Homer: OK.  Lisa, quit getting in the way of your wealthy brother's
       peas.
 Bart: Oh, yuck: meatloaf.  My most hated of all loafs.  [feeds his
       piece to SLH]
Homer: [gasps] That was the end piece!  That's it -- being abusive to
       your family is one thing, but I will not stand idly by and watch
       you feed a hungry dog.  Go to your room!
 Bart: No!  This family stinks!  Mr. Burns nurtures my destructive side
       -- I'm suffocating here!
Homer: {Bart, you listen --}
 Bart: {Oh, go eat some flowers!  [tosses some at Homer]}
Homer: {Aah!  My secret shame.}
-- 

{Bart walks out of the living room and} rides his bike off to Burns' in
a huff.  Burns watches his approach with delight.

Burns: Smithers, my plan worked perfectly.  Bart Simpson will live here
       as my son, and I will mold him in my own graven image.  Who knows
       -- I may even grow to...love him.
        [Bart runs up]
       Bartholomew!  [Bart hugs his legs]
       Smithers, get it off me!
-- Love, maybe, but no touching, 

Homer drives up in his car, right over Bart's bike, and orders Bart
home.

Homer: Bart, you're coming home.
 Bart: I want to stay here with Mr. Burns.
Burns: I suggest you leave immediately.
Homer: Or what?  You'll release the dogs, or the bees, or the dogs with
       bees in their mouths and when they bark they shoot bees at you?
       Well, go ahead -- do your worst!
        [Burns slams the door and locks it]
        [disbelieving] He locked the door!  I'll show him -- [rings the
       doorbell and runs away]
-- Swish, 

Marge and Homer turn to the Springfield police for help.

 Marge: I'm very concerned.  Mr. Burns has stolen our son and he won't
        give him back!
Wiggum: Oh, for gosh g -- can't you people solve these problems
        yourselves?  I mean, we can't be, er, "policing" the whole city.
-- 

That avenue blocked, legal action seems the only recourse.  The Simpson
parents go to Lionel Hutz, who doubles as a law-talking guy and a shoe-
repair guy.

   Hutz: Well, you good folks can rest easy now because you've come to
         the very best in legal representation.
Skinner: Uh, excuse me, is there an Orange Julius stand on this floor?
   Hutz: I'll sell you this one, it's almost full.
Skinner: Well, why don't I drink out of a toilet bowl.
   Hutz: He'll be back.  And as for your case, don't you worry.  I've
         argued in front of every judge in this state -- often as a
         lawyer.  [drinks his Orange Julius]
-- Small comfort, 

But the court case does not go well.  The judge rules in favor of
Montgomery Burns, who is clearly the boy's biological father.  Hutz
repairs the judge's shoes despite losing the case.  Marge questions the
wisdom of hiring Lionel Hutz repeatedly.

[End of Act Two.  Time: 13:42]

The scene opens with Milhouse and Bart in a room full of toys.  Milhouse
shoots a basketball into a small hoop as a train chugs by, tooting its
whistle.

Milhouse: Cool train!  Where does it go?
    Bart: Beats me.  But it won't be back for three hours and forty
          minutes.  Once it had snow on it.
-- The boys play with toys in Burns' mansion, 

Milhouse observes how Bart has everything he could ever want, while his
own parent use love as an excuse to deprive him of toys.  Milhouse
starts to leave Bart so he can be alone with his toys, but Bart tries to
bribe him with the Bob Mackie jacket he's wearing.  Milhouse declines.

Mr. Burns walks in and says, "Barthlomew, you don't need him.  I can be
your schoolyard chum."  To prove his point, he dons his old football
uniform and takes Bart out in the yard.  Bart stands back, ready to
catch the ball being held in place by Smithers, but as Burns runs at it,
he loses his energy and kicks Smithers instead.  They collapse in a
heap.

Mr. Burns ups the ante.

       [they walk towards a red sports car tied with a bow]
 Bart: For me?  But I don't know how to drive.
Burns: Pish, posh.  There's a Jaws of Life in the trunk.
-- 

Although Bart can't see over the dash, he floors it anyway, smashing
into a fire hydrant, a letter box, bales of hay, a "Santa's Christmas
Village" sign, some candy canes, reindeer, an elf, and a menorah.
Screeching to a halt, he sighs, "That was some ride," and the elf pops
up from the back seat: "You're telling me."

Marge and Homer resort to "Conformco Brain Deprogrammers."

Deprogrammer: Mr. and Mrs. Simpson, your son has clearly been
              brainwashed by the evil and charismatic Mr. Burns.
       Marge: Are you sure you can get him back for us?
Deprogrammer: Absolutely.  I'm the one who successfully deprogrammed
              Jane Fonda, you know.
       Marge: What about Peter Fonda?
Deprogrammer: Oh, that was a heartbreaker.  But I _did_ get Paul
              McCartney out of Wings.
       Homer: You idiot!  He was the most talented one.
-- Resting on his laurels, 

The deprogrammer speeds off to "The Happy Earwig Motel" and carries a
struggling blanket-covered figure inside.  "You do not love Mr. Burns!
You love Homer and Marge!  You are _their_ son!  What you are doing is
wrong.  Wrong.  Wrong!"  Mayor Quimby, in the next room in bed with a
woman, pounds on the wall.  "Do you mind?  You're killing the romance in
here!"

Homer and Marge pace anxiously outside the door of room 101 where the
deprogramming is taking place.

              [Deprogrammer walks out of the room]
Deprogrammer: Well, it was a gruelling two weeks -- but you have your
              son back.
               [Hans Moleman walks out]
        Hans: Mom, Dad, I missed you.
       Homer: Oh -- [kisses him a few times]
       Marge: Homer, that's Hans Moleman.
       Homer: Can I keep in anyway?  Huh?  Huh?
-- A welcome addition to any family, 

In Mr. Burns' mansion, he and the boy are seated in front of a giant TV
which shows Itchy &amp; Scratchy in "The Buck Chops Here."

The cat and mouse are outside the US Mint in front of a "Tour" sign.
The two shake hands and walk in.  The first room has large money bags
piled on shelves, and Itchy wastes no time in grabbing one and pounding
Scratchy flat with it.  The nasty mouse throws the stunned cat on a
conveyor belt where he is rolled flatter, stamped with the pattern for a
bill, sliced up into individual notes, and stacked in a tray.  Itchy
grabs the piles of legal-tender Scratchy, throws them in an armored car,
and drives into a tycoon convention, wherein dogs in suits stand around
smoking cigars.  Itchy hands one of them a bill with which to light his
cigar, and the dog lights it.  As the flame burns closer to the pyramid
on the bill, the eye above the pyramid panics and screams.

Burns and Bart laugh uproariously.  Burns, however, continues to laugh
long after Bart has tapered off.  Bart grimaces as Burns asks, "Is all
TV this wonderful?"  Bart asks to go home, and Burns stops laughing
quickly.

       Bart: Mr. Burns, I don't want to seem ungrateful, but I want to
             go home to my family.
      Burns: [sighs] I was hoping I wouldn't have to tell you this,
             but...I'm afraid your family doesn't want you back.
             [flicks a switch]
              [one of the TV monitors shows the Simpsons in the TV room]
      Homer: [not Homer's voice] I do not miss Bart at all.
      Marge: [not Marge's voice] I am glad he's gone.
       Lisa: [almost Lisa's voice] As am I.
      Homer: [drops a sandwich] B'oh!
       Bart: It's probably my imagination, but something about them
             didn't seem quite right.
      Burns: Really?  Excuse me for just a moment.
              [walks into a nearby room and shuts the door.  A TV set of
             the Simpsons living room has been set up.]
             People, that was all wrong.  Homer Simpson doesn't say
             "B'oh", he says [checks script] "D'oh"!
Actor Homer: [pulls mask off; looks like Michael Caine] Sorry, M.B., but
             I'm having trouble with this character.  Is he supposed to
             have some kind of neurological impairment, like "Rain Man",
             or "Awakenings"?  I mean, what the _hell_ am I doing here?!
Actor Marge: And this dialog has _none_ of the wit and sparkle of
             "Murphy Brown".
 Actor Lisa: [the midget Bart ran into] Hey, you know we are getting
             into golden time.
      Burns: Yes, well just get it right or you'll all be doing "Come
             Blow Your Horn" at the Westport Dinner Theater.
              [walks back out into the control room]
             All right, let's see what the old Simpson family is up to
             now.
Actor Homer: [drops sandwich] Duh-oh!
-- A tricky part to act, 

Bart is convinced this time.  "I can't believe it," he muses.  "You're
the only one I can trust...Dad," he says, reaching slowly towards Mr.
Burns.  As they hug, a loud snap is heard.  "Mmph, that rib _always_
breaks," laments Monty.

At the real Simpson homer, Marge looks at a baby picture of Bart and
groans.

       [Lisa tears off a strip of wallpaper]
Marge: Lisa, what are you doing?
 Lisa: Just trying to fill the void of random, meaningless destruction
       Bart's absence has left in our hearts.
        [Homer walks in; Lisa trips him]
Marge: Oh, that's sweet, honey.
-- 

Bart and Burns make a trip to the taylor's, where Bart is fitted out
with a suit just like his "father's".

       [Bart wears a suit and stands in front of a mirror]
 Bart: [strangled] It's a little tight...
Burns: Yes, that's to correct your posture.  Soon you'll have a mighty
       hump!  Now...you really are my son.  This calls for a
       celebration: let's fire some employees.
 Bart: _Ex_cellent.
-- Like father, like..., 

At the nuclear power plant, Bart and Burns stand in the latter's office.
Burns pushes a button, opening a sliding door through which Lenny walks.

Burns: OK, let's make this sporting, Leonard.  If you can tell me why I
       shouldn't fire you without using the letter "E", you can keep
       your job.
Lenny: Uh, OK.  Um, I'm a good...work...guy --
Burns: You're fired.
Lenny: But I didn't say --
Burns: [convinced certainty] You will.  [pushes a button]
Lenny: [falling through a trap door] EEEEeeeee!
-- Nostradamus would have been proud, 

Bart giggles and says, "Let me try one!"

          [Bart pushes a button; Homer walks in with an armful of
          donuts]
   Homer: Hey, the trail of donuts ended -- [gasps] Bart!
    Bart: [gasps] Homer!
   Burns: [gasps] What a coincidence!  And a perfect opportunity to
          prove your loyalty.  Go ahead, Bartholomew: you may fire when
          ready.
    Bart: [groans]
   Burns: Hurry...fire him now or I'll disown you.  You'll lose
          everything: the fabulous toys, the lifetime of wealth and
          luxury, the gift certificate from Blockbuster Video -- the
          freedom to do whatever you want!
   Homer: I'll miss you, son.
    Bart: I'm sorry, Dad...you're fired!
   Burns: What?  Fire _me_?  That does it: you can _never_ be my son!
    Bart: A little to the left.
   Burns: Huh?  Oh, very well.  [moves] You can never be my --
           [Bart pulls a lever; Burns falls through a trap door] EEEeee!
Smithers: [jumping in afterwards] Sir, try to land on Leonard's carcass!
-- Cushioning the blow, 

At home, shortly afterwards...

Homer: Son, I know you're upset because you thought you saw us on TV
       saying we didn't want you in our family.  But those were just
       actors playing us!
 Bart: How do you know?
Homer: Because one of them hung out with me for a week trying to get my
       character down.
 Lisa: Yeah, me too.  That midget taught me a lot about his native
       Estonia.
Marge: The point is, the real Simpson family missed you a lot and we're
       really glad you're home.  [kisses him]
 Bart: I love you guys.
Homer: Right back at you, son.
        [they all hug]
       And now I want you to meet your new brother: Hans Moleman.
        [Hans walks in dressed like Bart, holding a skateboard]
 Hans: Cowabunga, dudes.
        [Homer kisses him repeatedly]
Homer: Try it.  It's like kissing a peanut!  Heh heh heh.
-- An enigmatic simile, 

[End of Act Three.  Time: 21:18]

After the scene fades to black, Homer continues to kiss Hans, but Marge
says, "Homer, I want that thing out of my house."
 EPISODE TITLE: Sweet Seymour Skinner's Baadasssss Song


EPISODE SUMMARY: 
[Syndication cuts are marked in curly braces "{}" and are courtesy of
Ricardo Lafaurie and Frederic Briere.]

The scene opens a la "Wonder Years" with "With a Little Help from My
Friends" being covered in the background.  A young Homer washes his
muscle car with his fairly new girlfriend Marge.  He grins at the camera
as Marge turns the hose on him, dousing him.  Homer has neglected to put
the parking brake on in his car, it would seem: it rolls off the
driveway and onto the street.

In the next shot, it is Homer's birthday.  As Abe and Marge watch,
bearded Homer opens Marge's present -- a book about beards.  Delighted,
he shows it to the camera, then leans forward to blow out the candles on
his cake.  But his beard catches fire, and he runs back and forth in a
panic while Marge worries and Abe laughs.

            [Bart watches a home movie of Homer's birthday]
      Bart: [laughs] They're going to eat this up at Show and Tell.
     Marge: I'm not sure if I'm comfortable with the idea of your
            classmates laughing at our family's private moments.  How
            would you like it if, twenty years from now, people were
            laughing at things _you_ did?
      Bart: Not likely.  Come on, have a sense of humor about yourself!
             [the movie turns to baby Bart, naked, sitting on the
            toilet]
Young Bart: I'm a big boy today.
-- Maybe Mom _was_ right, 

Lisa laughs, and Bart sees reason.  He looks around for something else
to take to school, and Marge suggests a largish potato.  "Mom, you're
always trying to give me potatoes.  What is it with you?"  Marge
explains, "I just think they're neat."  Bart runs up to Lisa's room.

Bart: I need something for Show and Tell.
Lisa: Just take one of my geodes.
       [Bart stares blankly]
      The rocks on my desk.
       [Bart goes over, picks up something]
      No, that's a trilobyte.
       [Bart picks up something else]
      That's petrified wood.
       [Bart picks up something else]
      Bart, that's a bran muffin!
-- No petrified birds, however, "Sweet Seymour Skinner's Baadasssss
    Song"

Otto honks the bus horn outside, and Bart and Lisa walk out to it.  As
Bart steps on the bus with his geode in hand, he notices everyone else
has brought geodes, including Martin, who says, "Greetings, fellow
geodologist!"  Bart groans, steps off the bus, and looks around for
something else to take.  His eye falls on Santa's Little Helper; he
tears the dog away from chewing up the morning paper.

In class, {it is Nelson's turn at Show and Tell.}

  Nelson: {The ingredients were: fresh pureed tomatoes, water, salt, and
          sodium benzoate used to retard spoilage.  Once again, if I'm
          not mistaken, this can contained tomato paste.}
    Edna: {Thank you, Nelson.  I look forward to seeing it again next
          week.}  Bart, you're up.
           [Bart walks up as a cardboard box follows him]
    Bart: Boys and girls, Mrs. Krabappel, I come before you today to
          solve a riddle that has plagued mankind for centuries: What
          has four legs and ticks?
Milhouse: A walking clock?
  Nelson: A walking clock!
  Martin: I'd wager he has some variety of walking clock in that box!
    Edna: Bart, is it a walking clock?
    Bart: [mystified] What?  No, it's my dog.
-- That was my next guess, 

Everyone gasps with delight.

    Edna: [looking at SLH] Oh, he is a gem!  Here boy.  [kisses] Would
          you like these cookies Martin made for me?
  Martin: My raisin roundies!
    Bart: My dog's name is Santa's Little Helper.  One time he crawled
          under the house and when he came out he was covered with ants.
          Then he ran into a church and drank all the holy water.
Everyone: Wow!
-- Amazing but true, 

Mrs. Krabappel thanks Bart: "Great job!"  Everyone cheers as he walks
off.  "I knew the dog before he came to class," brags Milhouse.

Martin walks up, places his geode on the floor, and narrates
histrionically.

  Martin: Kaboom!  That, the sound of the thunderous volcanic explosion
          that gives birth to the magnificent geode, one of nature's
          most --
  Nelson: You're doing it wrong.  You gotta pet him hard so he can feel
          it.
           [he demonstrates; SLH sneezes]
  Sherri: Look, look, look!  The doggie sneezed.
    Edna: Hah!  It thinks it's people.
   Willy: [on the other side of the door] Hey, poochie!  Here, poochie,
          poochie, poochie!
  Martin: Ahem.  My geode must be acknowledged!
    Edna: [angrily] Oh, brother.  All right, back to Show and Tell!
          Bart, why don't you put the doggie away.
Everyone: Aw.
-- Short attention spans, 

Bart leads SLH to a closet and shuts the door on him.

Later, SLH awakes to smell something good coming from the vent.  Lunch
lady Doris' soup that day is particularly redolent, no doubt due to
extra helping of horse testicles she's added to it.  "More testicles
mean more iron!" she exclaims.  SLH can't resist, and he paws the vent
open and crawls inside.  He crawls past the grade two room.

 Ralph: Um, Miss Hoover?  There's a dog in the vent.
Hoover: Ralph, remember the time you said Snagglepuss was outside?
 Ralph: He was going to the bathroom.
-- The boy who cried "dog", 

Principal Skinner is on the phone in his office to the superintendent.

Skinner: [on the phone] I know Weinstein's parents were upset, uh,
         superintendent, but, but -- but I was _sure_ it was a phony
         excuse.  I mean, it sounds so made up: "yom kip pur".  [laughs
         sheepishly]
  Willy: [bursting in] Sir, you've got to come quick!  There's a dog
         running around in the air ducts.
Skinner: I understand.  [over PA] Children, this is Principal Skinner.
         Remain calm.  There is a dog in the vents.
          [In Bart's class, everyone cheers and gallavants]
-- That's not what he asked you to do, "Sweet Seymour Skinner's
    Baadasssss Song"

Willy pushes Skinner's desk over to the corner of the room for Skinner
to stand on.  He removes the vent cover and sticks his head into the
vent.  SLH licks his face happily and wanders off.

Skinner: Willy, go into the vent and get him.
  Willy: What?  Have you gone waxy in your peaster?  I cannot fit in
         tha' wee vent, you croquet-playing mint muncher.
Skinner: Grease yourself up and go in, you...you guff-speaking work-
         slacker.
  Willy: Ooh, good comeback.
-- Indeed, 

Willy approaches lunch lady Doris and asks her if they have any grease.
When she replies in the affirmative, he strips his shirt off and asks to
be greased up.

It really is a tight squeeze for him in the ventilation system.  He sees
a flash of brown cross the T junction at the end of the shaft in front
of him; behind him, at the other end, he sees another flash of brown
shortly after.  Skinner monitors Willy's and SLH's flashing dot on a
radar screen.  "Good Lord, it's coming up right behind him!"

Although SLH has no malevolent intentions.  He simply licks Willy's foot
repeatedly, but Willy is ticklish and begin laughing hysterically.
Several children are standing just under where he laughs, and they toss
books and other things at the vent, denting the metal.  Willy implores
them to stop.

Skinner rushes out and orders everyone back to their room.  "Uh oh.
Whenever I get this upset, I get hiccups!  (hic) Oh, right on cue..." he
moans, and everyone points and laughs.

Willy, meanwhile, has managed to orient himself so that he faces SLH,
who runs away from him.  But the wily Scotsman manages to catch up and
snag the stray mutt.

Willy: There's nary an animal alive that can outrun a greased Scotsman.
       Now, out we go --
        [pushes vent cover out; the cover hits the gymnasium floor far
       below.  The vent begins to pull from the roof]
       Urg...'tis more dizzying than the belfry at St. Caliga
       Glenwalgens.
-- Willy catches Santa's Little Helper, "Sweet Seymour Skinner's
    Baadasssss Song"

The fire department is called in to try to rescue the trapped pair.
Chief Wiggum arrives, greeting the basketball-playing Eddie and Lou
with, "That's nice work, boys."  Mrs. Krabappel sees superintendent
Chalmers arriving and takes great glee in pointing this out to the still
hiccuping Skinner.

 Chalmers: [voice rising] Skinner...!
  Skinner: Superintendent Chalmers!  You didn't have to come all the way
           down here.  Everything's under control.
            [fireman falls off ladder, which smashes the gym window]
Chalemers: Oh, I have had it, I have _had_ it with this school, Skinner!
           The low test scores, class after class of ugly, ugly children
           --
  Skinner: Oh, now I really think the children's appearance --
 Chalmers: Seymour, you are in very, _very_ big trouble.
            [SLH falls into his arms]
           Why, looking into this lovable mutt's eyes just melts my
           heart.  Seymour, all is forgiven.
    Willy: [yells] Make way for Willy!  [lands on Chalmers] I said "Make
           way for Willy," you bloated gasbag.
 Chalmers: Seymour...
  Skinner: Hmm?
 Chalmers: You're fired!
            [Bart gasps]
  Skinner: I'm sorry, did...did you just call me a liar?
 Chalmers: No, I said you were fired.
  Skinner: Oh.  That's much worse.
-- In some ways, yes, 

[End of Act One.  Time: 7:40]

Next morning at breakfast, everyone but Bart eats their food noisily.

Bart: I thought I'd be jumping for joy the day Skinner got fired.  Now
      all I have is this weird hot feeling in the back of my head.
Lisa: That's guilt.  You feel guilty because your stunt wound up costing
      a man his job.
Bart: I guess it is guilt.
       [scratches his head; a small spider bites him repeatedly there]
-- The poisonous fangs of guilt, "Sweet Seymour Skinner's Baadasssss
    Song"

Homer: {Whoa, whoa, whoa -- let me get this straight.  They let
       everybody out of school early just because _you_ brought a dog?}
 Bart: {Well, yeah, but --}
Homer: {Well, I'm off to work.  [picks up SLH]}
Marge: {The dog has had enough excitement.}
Homer: {But Marge, dogs can _never_ have enough excitement.  Look:
       [swings SLH around] whee!  Whee!  Heh heh.  Whee!
        [giving in] All right, all right.  I won't take the dog.
        [grabs Maggie] Come here!
        [Marge grabs her back]
        [Homer moans]}
-- 

At Springfield Elementary, Chalmers has called an assembly.

Chalmers: Boys and girls, because of Mr. Skinner's sudden departure,
          I've had to appoint a new principal.  Leopold?
           [hulking Leopold stands, and everyone gasps in fear]
 Leopold: All right, you little punks: pick up your freakin' ears,
          because I'm only going to be saying this once.  From now on,
          things are going to be _very_, _very_ different around here --
           [everyone gasps]
          -- with your new principal Ned Flanders!
           [everyone claps]
     Ned: Well, tippety-top of the A.M. to every-good-body here.  As
          chairman of the PTA, I am de-diddley-lighted to take over here
          and I think I can put the "pal" back in "principal".
           [everyone laughs]
Chalmers: Heh heh, yeah.  And I'll put the "super" back in
          "superintendent".
           [one person coughs]
          It's the same exact joke.  What gives, Leo?
-- It's because you're bald, 

     Ned: Now, I know everybody's eager to get back to class --
    Edna: Hah!
     Ned: -- but I thought it might break the ice if we had a little Q &amp;
          A!
 Kearney: [to Jimbo] Dude, ask a question or we'll have to go back to
          class!
   Jimbo: [stands up] Um...
     Ned: Yeah. you!
   Jimbo: Uh, yeah, uh, I was wondering, do you, er, what's your policy
          on, uh, lunch?
     Ned: Well, let me just say I want to put the "stew" back in
          "students".
           [everyone laughs]
Chalmers: {It's just a damn popularity contest with you kids!  [walks
          off]}
 Leopold: {Now look what you've done, you little freaks!}
-- The sensitive side of the superintendent, "Sweet Seymour Skinner's
    Baadasssss Song"

At the Kwik-E-Mart, Apu chides Bart for abusing the self-serve ice cream
dispenser and making a foot-high cone.  Milhouse spies a familiar face
in one of the aisles.

Milhouse: Bart, look!  It's Principal Skinner.  And I think he's gone
          crazy -- he's not wearing a suit or tie or anything!
    Bart: [approaches him] Principal Skinner?  Um, I'm real sorry about
          my dog getting you fired, and biting you, and then getting it
          on with your leg.
 Skinner: Well...maybe it was for the best.  Now I...I finally have time
          to do what I've always wanted: write the great American novel.
          Mine is about a futuristic amusement park where dinosaurs are
          brought to life through advanced cloning techniques.  I call
          it "Billy and the Cloneasaurus."
     Apu: Oh, you have _got_ to be kidding sir.  First you think of an
          idea that has already been done.  Then you give it a title
          that nobody could possibly like.  Didn't you think this
          through...
           [later]...was on the bestseller list for eighteen months!
          Every magazine cover had...
           [later]...most popular movies of all time, sir!  What were
          you thinking?!  [realizing] I mean, thank you, come again.
-- Remembering his role, 

At Springfield Elementary, Principal Flanders berates Bart.

 Ned: Bart, I've barely been here a good solid week, and you've been
      sent to my office eleven times.  And now that I have peanut butter
      cups, you seem to be getting in trouble every hour.
Bart: [through a full mouth] Must have been a coincidence.
 Ned: Uh, anyhoo, Bart, you're going to have to be punished.  This isn't
      some sort of clubhouse.
       [Bart holds up an empty glass and rattles it]
      Oh, sorry: were you drinking Slice or Yoo Hoo?
-- Lousy irony!, 

Principal Skinner is in the laundromat, trying to pick a detergent from
the vending machine.

Skinner: Let's see: Tide...Cheer...Bold...Biz...Fab...All...Gain...Wisk.
         I believe today I will try...Bold.
          [Bart skateboards by] Bart!  How are you?  How's school?
   Bart: Um...it's a lot of fun.  [pause] Well, it was good to see you
         --
Skinner: It was?  Well then we should get together again.  Say, er,
         Saturday at my house.  You know where I live?
   Bart: Er, no...
          [flashback to Bart knocking on a door and running]
Skinner: [answers door, looks down] Hmm.  A flaming bag, eh?  Well,
         these new Italian loafers will make short work of it.  [stomps
         on it]
          [back to the present]
   Bart: Er, I'm kind of busy on Saturday.
          [Dolph, Jimbo, and Kearney run by.  Jimbo darts in]
Skinner: Hey!
  Jimbo: [taunts] We got Skinner's underpants!  And there's nothing you
         can do about it, Mr. Ex-Principal.
Skinner: That's not true.  I can buy a new pair!  [checks his wallet] No
         I can't.  I needed those, I really did.
-- Unemployed, unemployable, 

Bart relents and decides to visit Skinner after all.  He knocks on
Skinner's door, and is greeted by Skinner's mother.  "Oh, you must be
Seymour's friend.  He's up in his room.  Don't touch the wallpaper," she
cautions.

Bart opens Skinner's bedroom door to find him conducting a recording of
Beethoven's fifth.

Skinner: Bart!  Heh heh, welcome.  Can I offer you a Diet Caffeine-Free
         Dr. Pepper or an individual fruit cocktail cup?
   Bart: Uh, I'll pass.  Hey, what's this?  [points to photo]
Skinner: Oh, that's my old unit from Vietnam.  I was their sergeant,
         they were my loyal troops.
          [photo shows Skinner saluting and his men scowling at him]
         That photo was taken shortly before I was shot in the back --
         which was very strange because it was during a Bob Hope show.
         I was trying to get Joey Heatherton to put on some pants, for
         God's sake.
 Mother: [from downstairs] Seymour, your friend Bart is here.
Skinner: I know, Mother!
 Mother: Seymour, do you want me to tell you when it's 7:30?
Skinner: No, Mother!
-- It's 7:30...now!, 

Seymour and Bart go out to the backyard where Skinner, donning a
"Principals do it 9 months a year" apron, barbeques some hot dogs.

Skinner: [laughing hard] Ned Flanders actually eliminated detention and
         put the whole school on the honor system?
   Bart: [laughs] Yeah.  And the teachers are afraid to leave the
         faculty lounge!  [laughs]
Skinner: [chuckles] Oh, ho ho, that place must be falling apart.  Oh,
         mercy.  [quietly] Nobody's mentioned me, have they?
   Bart: Er, I thought I heard someone say your name in the cafeteria,
         but they might have been saying "skim milk".
-- Lousy homonyms!, 

Skinner and Bart go to the seashoe at sunset.  Skinner spies a shell and
listens for the ocean in it, only to be rewarded by having a crab latch
onto his ear.  Bart obligingly bats it away with a stick.

On another occasion, Skinner takes Bart to a restaurant.

Skinner: I thought you might like this restaurant, Bart.  They'll make a
         pizza pie with the topping of your choice!
   Chef: Hey, Seymour-ah.  You wanna your usual-ah table?
Skinner: No, no, Luigi.  I'd like one with two seats.  I'll be dining
         with a friend tonight.
   Chef: Hey, good for you, huh?  [goes into the kitchen]
Skinner: Hmm, it's real nice here.
   Chef: Hey, Salvatore, guess who's here-ah?  Mister Kookalamanza, and-
         ah some real ugly kid-ah.
-- If that's real nice..., 

Skinner's prediction was right: Bart's school has degenerated
considerably since Skinner was there.  The grade fours run about with
nary an Edna in sight.  Nelson tears up a book, Wendell climbs on a
podium, and Martin is suspended above the class in a cage.  Paper
airplanes and garbage fly through the air.

Milhouse: [squirting ketchup on his stomach] This is great!  Not only am
          I not learning, I'm forgetting stuff I used to know, heh.  And
          it's all thanks to you, Bart.
    Bart: Yeah, great.
Milhouse: What's the matter?
    Bart: Don't you see, Milhouse?  We've gone too far.  We need Skinner
          back.
  Martin: My water dish is empty...
-- Your points being?, 

One night, the ex-principal walks past the school and thinks back.  A
little girl tells him, "I learned to read because of you, Principal
Skinner".  Martin says, "Sir, I baked you these raisin roundies."  Ralph
says, "Sir, I got carsick in your office."  Sobbing, Skinner walks away.

Bart pays another visit to Seymour's house.  His mother greets him and
hands Bart a note in which Skinner writes, "Bart, your friendship during
this difficult time will not be forgotten.  However, I've decided to
return to the only thing besides school that has ever given my life
meaning.  I have re-enlisted in the United States Army.  Sincerely,
Sergeant Seymour Skinner."  {Depressed, Bart goes to Luigi's
restaurant.}

Bart: {Table for one.}
Chef: {Oh, you miss you friend, huh?  Don't-ah you worry, my cook can
      surely cheer you up-ah.
       [enters kitchen] Hey Salvatore, give-ah the ugly kid a plate of
      the red-ah crap-ah!}

[End of Act Two.  Time: 16:04]

At Fort Springfield, Sgt. Skinner, resplendent in his uniform, walks
along with a colonel.

  Colonel: It's good to have another combat veteran around here.  I
           myself received a number of medals for, um, securing that
           Montgomery Ward in Kuwait City?
  Skinner: Hmm, yes, colonel.  Now I understand it will be my duty to
           mold the new recruits into a well-disciplined, highly-trained
           infantry unit.
  Colonel: Sure, I, I guess.  Here they come!  [a bus arrives]
Recruit 1: Hey, where do I get my grenades at?
Recruit 2: They don't have them group toilets here no more, do they?
-- Highly potty-trained, anyway, "Sweet Seymour Skinner's Baadasssss
    Song"

Marge and Homer sir Principal Flanders' office.

    Marge: Ned, Homer and I are a little concerned with the way the
           school's being run.
    Homer: [mouth full of peanut butter cups] Yes.  Deeply concerned.
      Ned: I may go a little easy on the old hickory-dickory stick, but
           that's just because my dad was hard on me when I was a boy.
            [flashback to New York City; a young Ned spills some ink]
Young Ned: Whoopsie doodle.
Ned's Dad: Oh, man!  Ned spelled ink all over my poems.  He's a real
           flat tire, I mean a cube, man.  He's putting us on the train
           to Squaresville, Mona!
-- Ned, the product of beatniks?, "Sweet Seymour Skinner's Baadasssss
    Song"

At Fort Springfield, Seymour runs alongside his company while they chant
army songs.

    Men: [jogging]
         "I knew a woman in Paris, France,
         Had a big hole in her underpants" --
Skinner: Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Where did you pick up that filth?
Recruit: We heard Sergeant Clarke's company singing it, Sir!
Skinner: Yes, well there will be no smut in my company.  You're in this
         man's army to learn!
    Men: [jogging]
         "I don't know, but I've been told
         The parthenon is mighty old."
Skinner: How old?
    Men: We don't know.
Skinner: That's real good, but needs improvement.
-- Important knowledge for _anyone_, "Sweet Seymour Skinner's Baadasssss
    Song"

Bart sits on the couch and sighs at a photo Seymour sent him from the
Fort.

      [Bart sighs at photo of Skinner]
Lisa: Wow, I never thought Principal Skinner could become any more of a
      square, but there's the proof.
Bart: It's weird, Lis: I miss him as a friend, but I miss him even more
      as an enemy.
Lisa: I think you need Skinner, Bart.  Everybody needs a nemesis.
      Sherlock Holmes had his Dr. Moriarty, Mountain Dew has its Mellow
      Yellow, even Maggie has that baby with the one eyebrow.
       [Maggie scowls out the window as said baby goes by in a baby
      buggy]
-- 

Skinner stands next to his recruits who practice with mortars, watching
through binoculars the spots where their bombs land.  Bart rides over a
hill in Skinner's field of vision.

Skinner: Man on the range!  Change your trajectories!
          [the recruits strain to comply]
          [scene change to Apu and Sanjay at the Kwik-E-Mart]
    Apu: Sixteen brand new gas pumps.  At last we can compete with the
         Gas-N-Gulp.
          [they look up as whistling is heard overhead]
-- _Could_ have competed, 

At Fort Springfield, a giant red "K" lands upright in the ground behind
Bart and Seymour.

   Bart: If there was some way to get rid of Flanders, would you want to
         come back?
Skinner: Ehh, I must admit, I do miss the school.  And frankly, the army
         isn't _quite_ as I remembered it --
          [some recruits drive by in a tank.  One moons Skinner, another
         swears at him, another tosses a beer can at him]
         Actually, it's _exactly_ as I remembered it.
-- The more things change..., 

Skinner: I do want to come back, but it doesn't sound like Flanders is
         going to get fired.
   Bart: Oh, I think I could get him fired.  I got you fired, didn't I?
         [laughs]
Skinner: [unimpressed] Yes.
-- A painful memory, 

Skinner points out that their friendship will have to end if Skinner
comes back as principal -- unless Bart becomes a good student.  Bart
doesn't think that's likely, and Skinner agrees, but says, "We'll always
have the laundromat."

Bart has invited Skinner over to discuss the plans for Ned's
dishonorable discharge.

          [Skinner walks in, sees Homer]
 Skinner: What's _he_ doing here?
    Bart: Well once he found out we were going to get Ned Flanders
          fired, he _insisted_ on helping.
   Homer: That is true.
    Bart: Here's the plan: once Chalmers comes for his next inspection
          and sees how crappy the school has gotten, he'll fire Ned on
          the spot.
 Skinner: Er, one question remains: how do I get out of the army?
    Bart: No problemo.  Just make a pass at your commanding officer!
 Skinner: Done and done.  And I mean done.
   Marge: [outside] What's going on in there?
Everyone: Nothing...
-- No, really, 

In Bart's classroom, Martin does someone's ironing in his suspended cage
while singing, "Toreador en garde..." Bart shows Chalmers the deplorable
state the school has fallen into.

    Bart: Come on, Chalmie, you fired Skinner for less than this.
Chalmers: Yeah, I did, but...Skinner really bugged me!  Besides, the way
          America's public schools are sliding, they'll all be this way
          in a few months.  I say, lay back and enjoy it!  It's a hell
          of a toboggan ride.
     Ned: [over PA] Well, cockly-doodly-doo, little buddies.  Let's
          thank the Lord for another beautiful school day.
Chalmers: Thank the Lor -- thank the Lord?  That sounded like a prayer.
          A prayer.  A prayer in a public school!  God has no place
          within these walls, just like facts have no place within
          organized religion.  Simpson, you get your wish: Flanders is
          history!
           [scene change to Willy cleaning graffiti off the lockers]
     Ned: Well, I really enjoyed my time here, Superintendent.  May the
          Lord bless and keep you.
Chalmers: Yeah, take it outside, God-boy.
     Ned: Okily dokily.
 Skinner: Dirksen, tuck in your shirt.  Jaffee, spit out that gum!
 Leopold: You really think it's a good idea to give that _freak_ his job
          back?
Chalmers: Aw, he seems to know the students' names.
-- A compelling reason, 

Bart and Skinner stand alone in the hall.  "So...I guess we're enemies
again," observes Bart.  Skinner agrees, and thanks Bart.  The two of
them hug, and as Skinner walks away, Bart chuckling at the "KICK ME"
sign on his back.  Skinner turns back to laugh at the "TEACH ME" sign on
Bart's back.  "Oh, Mercy," he grins.

[End of Act Three.  Time: 21:05]
 EPISODE TITLE: The Boy Who Knew Too Much


EPISODE SUMMARY: 
[Syndication cuts are marked in curly braces "{}" and are courtesy of
Ricardo Lafaurie and Frederic Briere.]

It's another bright, sunny school day in Springfield.  Bart and Lisa
wait at the door of their house for the bus.

Bart: Oh, how can they imprison kids in school on a beautiful day like
      this?
Lisa: They're not imprisoning us, Bart, they're --
       [a grey bus labeled "Springfield Prison" pulls up]
Bart: [getting on] Prison bus, Otto?
Otto: The regular school bus broke down, so take a seat before I blow
      your heads off!
Lisa: Otto...!
Otto: Oh, sorry.  This bus and I have sort of a "Shining" thing going
      on.
-- Incomprehensible justifications, 

One of the convicted plays the blues on a harmonica while another bangs
a metal cup against the bars on the window.  Bart groans and looks
longingly out the window at a nearby stream, imagining he's lying on a
raft floating down it with a dark-skinned boy.  "Ah," he sighs, "this is
what being a kid is all about."  Looking up, he notices a strange figure
on the raft with them, and asks, "Hey Huck, what's L-I-N-C-O-N doing
here?" to which Huck responds, "I dunno; it's your fantasy."  Bart and
Abe great each other.

The bus skids to a stop at the school, awakening Bart from his reverie.
In the grade four class, everyone groans and moans about the new chairs.

    Edna: Well, children, our new ultra-hard PostCherfect chairs have
          arrived.  They've been designed by eminent posturologists to
          eliminate slouching by the year 3000.
  Martin: Mrs. Krabappel?  [groans] I'm having back spasms...
    Edna: [chuckles] I know they seem a little uncomfortable right now,
          but eventually your bones will change shape.
Milhouse: I've lost all feeling in the left side of my body.  [lifts his
          limp left arm with his right arm]
    Edna: Yeah, yeah.
-- Recognizing the signs of danger, 

"Now unfortunately, our school clocks have been running fast all
semester," she continues, "so today we all have to stay two extra hours
to make up for the time we lost.  Hah!"  Everyone moans, and Bart looks
at the clock tampering kit in his desk and regrets using it.  He turns
to look out the window at the rainbow and sunshine, a squirrel gamboling
on a nearby branch, when he sees a red sports car approach.  Seated next
to a delectable blond, its Quimby-esque driver laughs, "And to think I
got all this after dropping out of the fourth grade!"

   Bart: [to himself] That does it, I'm outta here.
          [scribbles something on paper]
         Mrs. Krabappel, I have to go to the dentist.  I have a carroway
         seed caught under my bridgework.  [hands her the note] My Mom's
         number's on there if you want to check up on me.
   Edna: That's OK, Bart.  I trust you.
          [in Skinner's office, Skinner holds a magnifying glass]
Skinner: [reading] "Please excuse my handwriting, I busted whichever
         hand it is I write with.  Signed, Mrs. Simpson."  You were
         right to be suspicious, Edna.  To the crime lab!
-- High-tech elementary schools, 

The results appear on a punch-card, but they're inconclusive.  Skinner
rues that more students other than Martin didn't agree to have an
electronic tracking device implanted in their skull.

{Skinner decides to interrogate Lisa.}

  Willy: {Spill it!  Where's your brother?}
Skinner: {You'd better answer him, Lisa.  He's a bad man.
          [Lisa giggles]
         What are you laughing about?}
   Lisa: {You started off as the bad cop, but now you're the good one!
         You and Willy got mixed up about ten minutes ago.}
Skinner: {We did not!  Now where's Bart?  You better tell me!}
  Willy: {Oh, you better tell him, lassie.  I cannot control him when he
         gets like this!}
   Lisa: {[laughs] Now _you're_ the good cop!}
  Willy: {What?!}
-- Not getting their act together, 

Bart lies next to the river, a string with a fishing bobble tied to his
toe, and he sighs, "Ah, the joys of mortgaging your future."  In the
mist he sees a raft approaching with two men standing on it.  He assumes
his fantasy has come true, but it's just two homeless men.  "Hey kid!
You wanna see a dead body?" one asks, and Bart runs off screaming.

Principal Skinner has decided to walk around town to see if he can find
our delinquent young friend.

   Skinner: If I were a truant boy out for a good time, I'd be right
            here: the Springfield Natural History Museum.  [chuckles]
            You're mine, Simpson.
             [Bart argues at a triple-R rated movie box office]
      Bart: Look, if I was under seventeen, I'd be in school, right?
Ticket boy: Yeah, I guess you're right.  Enjoy "Boobarama", sir.
             [Skinner has left the museum, meanwhile]
   Skinner: Why, there are no children here at the four-H club, either!
            Am I so out of touch...?  No, it's the children who are
            wrong.
-- Firm in his conviction, 

Bart has decided to bid on some priceless works of art at an auction
house.  The auctioneer announces, "Sold to the small man with the runny
nose for 2.3 million."  When Bart giggles and takes off, the auctioneer
goes back to the man who made the next highest bid of 2.1 million, but
he reacts the same way Bart does.  It transpires that no one made a
serious bid on the lot.

          [Bart and Homer spot each other suddenly.  They gasp]
    Bart: I can't let Dad see me playing hooky!
   Homer: I can't let the boy see me skipping work!
           [Bart brushes his hair forward; Homer uses a comb as a
          mustache]
    Bart: [walking past] Good afternoon.
   Homer: [walking past] How do you do, sir?
Together: [chuckle] Sucker...
-- Masters of disguise, 

Skinner walks along the sidewalk elsewhere and sees a piece of chewed
gum on the ground.

Skinner: A spoor!
          [reaches down, picks up the gum, licks it]
         His brand of gum, Doublemint.  Trying to double your fun, eh,
         Bart?  Well, I'll double your detention.  {Heh.  I wish someone
         was around to hear that.}
         And so we enter...endgame.
-- Skinner, hot on Bart's trail, 

Bart walks out of an ice cream parlor with a giant cone, only to drop it
when he sees Skinner approaching in the distance.  "Ay caramba!" he
cries, and runs off, down the street, down a grassy hill, and to a rope
bridge across a raging river.  He pauses, then runs across it, pulling a
jagged knife from his pocket and cutting its from its moorings.  "Let's
see him track me now," he giggles.

But Skinner is relentless.  He walks straight into the quickly flowing
stream, disappearing briefly underwater, but reemerging from it soon
enough.  Bart watched from behind a tree.

Bart: Oh my God, he is like some sort of...non...giving up...school guy!
-- Bart is chased by Principal Skinner, 

Bart climbs a sheer cliff in an attempt to get away, but Skinner is not
to be outdone.  Bart seem him making his way inexorably up its face, and
he hides behind a rock.  Upon reaching the top, Skinner stands up and
walks towards the rock: "Oh, he's close!  I can taste his fear."  He
pounces on the rock.

But Bart is nowhere to be found.  Luckily, Freddy Quimby sped by in his
sports car at just the right moment for Bart to jump in and hide under a
blanket.

Blonde: Freddy honey?  I think something just dropped into the back
        seat.
Freddy: I'm not paying you to talk.
-- Bart escapes in Freddy Quimby's car, 

The car speeds into the Quimby compound as the gates slam behind it.
There seems to be a party on the lawn; Freddy crashes through the bushes
in his car and speeds towards everyone, swerving and skidding to a halt
just in time.

        [Freddy approaches two people tossing a football]
Freddy: Gimme the ball!
         [runs to the punch bowl, throws it in hard]
        The punch has been spiked!  Ha ha!
Quimby: That's my nephew, displaying the Quimby wit that's won the
        public heart.  Happy birthday, Freddy!  And may all your
        disgraces be private.
-- Witty indeed, 

Bart hops out of the car and looks around.  He walks towards a patio but
is stopped by Diamond Joe.

Quimby: And who are you, little boy?
  Bart: I'm one of your nephews you don't see very often.  Um, Bart-
        Bart.
-- Bart tries to crash Freddy Quimby's party, "The Boy Who Knew Too
    Much"

Bart spies McBain with his wife and goes over to chat.

  Bart: Hey, McBain, I'm a big fan, but your last movie really sucked.
McBain: I know.  There were script problems from day one.
Wiggum: Yeah, I'll say.  Magic ticket, my ass, McBain.
McBain: [to his wife] Maria, my mighty heart is breaking.  I'll be in
        the Humvee.
-- Not-so-adoring fans, 

Inside, at lunch, Freddy is served something in a bowl by a waiter.

Freddy: Hey!  What the hell is this?
Waiter: [French accent] It's a bowl of chowder, sir.  ["shaudere"]
Freddy: Wait a minute, come here.  What did you call it?  Say it loud
        enough so everyone can hear.  Cone on, say it...
Waiter: Ahem.  Chowder.  ["shaudere"]
Freddy: [raucous laughter] Shau-dere?  Shau-dere?  It's "chowder".
        ["chowdah"] Say it right!
Waiter: [pause] Chowder.  ["shaudear"]
Freddy: [laugher] Come back here!  I'm not through demeaning you.
-- Gotta love those Quimbys, 

Bart, who was probably not invited to the table, stands in front of a
giant Rice Krispie[tm] square (more of a cube) admiring its size.  He
takes a bite from it -- "Boy, the rich sure know how to live!"  But
Freddy and the waiter enter and Bart hides under the table, peeking out.
Freddy tries to get the waiter to say "chowder" again, but the waiter
refuses adamantly.  "Never!"  So Freddy responds, "OK, you asked for it.
I'm gonna enjoy this!"  As Bart watches, we hear loud crashing and
snapping. followed by breaking glass.  The waiter falls in front of
Bart, breaking something in the process.  "Oy, that's gotta hurt!" he
winces.

Wiggum and a couple of others burst in.  "Oh my God," says the chief of
police, "someone's taken a bite out of the big Rice Krispie square!"  As
an afterthought: "Oh yeah, and the waiter's been brutally beaten.  Heh
heh."

[End of Act One.  Time: 8:47]

Marge reads the paper at the kitchen table with Lisa while Bart eats
some cereal.

Marge: [reading the paper] Mmm.  It says Freddy Quimby beat a waiter
       half to death!  Those Quimby children are so wild and rich, I
       hope he finally gets what's coming to him.
 Bart: But Freddy Quimby's innocent!
 Lisa: How do you know?  There weren't any witnesses.
 Bart: Heh, oh yeah, right.
 Lisa: You'd think someone would have seen something at a crowded party
       like that.
 Bart: Well they didn't, OK?  They didn't.  It says right here in black
       and white, "No witnesses."  Case closed.  [grabs paper] Now let's
       all read the funnies.  [reads] Oh look: Charlie Brown said "good
       grief".  Hah.  I didn't see _that_ coming.  [forced laughter]
-- 37 years of "Good Grief", 

Bart's conscience gets to him on the school bus.

   Bart: Lisa, I gotta tell somebody.  I was at the Quimby compound
         yesterday when that frog waiter got whacked.  I _know_ that
         Freddy Quimby is innocent.
   Lisa: You're a witness?  Bart, you have to tell the police!
   Bart: [groans] I can't.
   Lisa: Why?
Skinner: Bart Simpson, I know you cut school yesterday, and as soon as I
         can prove it, I'm sending you off to the Christian Military
         Reform School.
   Bart: What he said.
   Lisa: Oh, I see.
-- 

 Lisa: If you testify, Skinner will know you skipped school.  Well, if
       Freddy Quimby didn't do it, I'm sure he'll be found innocent by a
       fair and impartial jury.
        [after school]
Homer: Aw, jury duty?  I'll see that Quimby kid hanged for this!
 Bart: Oh...
 Lisa: {I _knew_ it was a bad idea to watch him open the mail.}
-- Fair and impartial both, 

Channel six covers the trial.

Scott: Let's go over to the County Courthouse, live to Kent Brockman.
 Kent: -- ockman, just outside the County Courtroom where an argument
       about chowder has spilled over into the biggest trial in
       Springfield history.  Behind these doors, a federal judge will
       ladle out steaming bowls of rich, creamy justice in a case the
       media have dubbed "Beat-Up Waiter."  This reporter suggested
       "Waitergate", but was howled down at the press club.
       Now, it's illegal to televise court proceedings in this state, so
       [whispers] we'll have to be quiet.
        [walks towards courtroom doors only to have them slammed in his
       face]
-- A sneaky ruse, 

Bart sits in the front row looking at the members of the jury.

         [Skinner scowls at Bart from the jury box]
Skinner: [thinking] I know you can read my thoughts, Bart.  Just a
         little reminder: if I found out you cut class, your ass is
         mine.  Yes, you head me.  I _think_ words I would never say.
  Homer: [thinking] I know you can read _my_ thoughts, boy.  [singing]
         Meow meow meow meow, meow meow meow meow, meow meow meow meow
         meow meow meow meow...
-- Not the Meow Mix commercial!, 

The trial begins.  Freddy's lawyer makes his opening statement.

Lawyer: I intend to prove that Freddy Quimby is totally innocent!  First
        of all, his accuser is a very shady character.  That waiter, Mr.
        LaCoste, not only wasn't born in Springfield, he wasn't even
        born in this country!
         [jury gasps, reporters run to phones and dial rapidly]
  Hutz: [to LaCoste] From now on, you tell me _everything_!
-- The key to the defense, 

Moe is the first to testify for Freddy.

  Moe: Freddy Quimby was with me the entire...night in question.  We
       were collecting canned goods for the starving people in...er, you
       know, one of them loser countries.
Woman: He's clearly innocent.
        [Chief Wiggum hands him a big bag with "$" on it]
  Moe: Oh good!  My laundry is done.
 Bart: You see, Lisa?  They don't need my testimony.
 Lisa: Only because Mayor Quimby's _buying_ his nephew's freedom.
 Bart: Ah.  The system works.  Just ask Claus von Bulow.
-- No insulin in _this_ trial, however, 

Lionel Hutz makes a statement for the jury.

   Hutz: Ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to prove to you not only that
         Freddy Quimby is guilty, but that he is also innocent of _not_
         being guilty.  I refer you to my expert witness, Dr. Hibbert.
Hibbert: Well, only one in two million people has what we call the "evil
         gene".  [holds up a card showing DNA] Hitler had it, Walt
         Disney had it, and Freddy Quimby has it.  [chuckles]
   Hutz: Thank you, Dr. Hibbert.  I rest my case.
  Judge: You rest your case?
   Hutz: What?  Oh no, I thought that was just a figure of speech.  Case
         closed.  [sits down]
-- Proper legal terms, 

Apu notices something amiss on the jury.

  Apu: Excuse me, Your Honor?  I'd like to bring something to the
       court's attention.
        [removes "open eye" glasses from snoring, drooling Homer]
        [judge bangs her gavel]
Homer: [waking up] Hmm?  Huh?  What?!
Judge: Give those glasses to the bailiff.
Homer: [crafty] All right.
        [does so, dons a "half-open eyes" pair]
Judge: And those.
Homer: [moaning] Oh.
-- He should have waited a bit, 

Lawyer: Your Honor, even though I've proven my client's innocence, I'd
        still like to call Freddy Quimby to the stand.  So that we can
        all bask in his gentle decency.
         [Freddy stands up, grins winningly at audience, takes stand]
        Mr. Quimby, did you assault Mr. LaCoste?
Freddy: Of course not.  I love each and every thing on God's green
        earth.
Lawyer: Therefore, you would _never_ lose your temper over something as
        trivial as the pronunciation of "chowder".
Freddy: That's "chowdah"!  Chowdah!  I'll kill you!  I'll kill all of
        you, especially those of you in the jury!
         [man on jury mutters, "He's clearly guilty"]
Lawyer: Wow, that didn't go well.  The defense rests.
-- Making the best of a bad situation, 

The lawyers have called all their witnesses.

       Judge: Will the jury retire and come to its decision?
Mrs. Lovejoy: Heh, this won't take long.  He's clearly guilty.  We'll
              probably be home by dinner time.
      Jasper: Good.  I hear the dog from "Frasier" is going to ride the
              dolphin on "Sea Quest".
-- Gotta rush home, then, 

Lisa castigates Bart as the jury leaves.

     Lisa: Well, Bart, because of you, a horrible yet innocent person is
           going to jail.
     Bart: Hmm.  Maybe I should come forward.
  Skinner: I can't wait for the sentencing part!  That's where I really
           shine.
            [Bart imagines standing in front of Skinner at the bench]
  Skinner: Bart, for the heinous crime of "hooky", I sentence you to a
           lifetime of hard labor in the cafeteria.
            [in the cafeteria]
     Bart: [smoking] More cream corn, Jimbo Junior?
Jimbo Jr.: This cream corn tastes like cream crap!
     Bart: Watch the potty-mouth, honey.
            [back to the present]
    Judge: Your sister says you have something to tell me?
     Bart: What?  Uh, um, yeah, uh, I just, I just wanted to say how
           great it is to finally see some chicks on the bench.
    Judge: Hmm.
     Bart: Keep up the good work, toots.  [forced laughter] [runs out]
    Judge: Hmm.
     Lisa: [sheepish] Heh heh, "chicks on the bench".  [forced laughter]
-- A blow for women's lib, 

[End of Act Two.  Time: 16:37]

The jury discuss the case in their private room.

  Jasper: Why bother voting?  He's guilty.
Flanders: Well, we might as well make it official.
   Homer: What does "sequestered" mean?
 Skinner: If the jury is deadlocked they're put up in a hotel together
          so they can't communicate with the outside world.
   Homer: What does "deadlocked" mean?
 Skinner: It's when the jury can't agree on a verdict.
   Homer: Uh huh.  And "if"?
 Skinner: A conjunction meaning "in the event that" or "on condition
          that".
   Homer: So _if_ we don't all vote the same way, we'll be _deadlocked_
          and have to be _sequestered_ in the Springfield Palace Hotel
          --
   Patty: That's not going to happen, Homer.
  Jasper: Let's vote.  My liver is failing.
   Homer: -- where we'll get a free room, free food, free swimming pool,
          free HBO -- Ooh!  "Free Willy"!
 Skinner: Justice is not a frivolous thing, Simpson.  It has little if
          anything to do with a disobedient whale.  Now let's vote!
   Homer: Uh, how are the rest of you voting?
Everyone: Guilty.
   Homer: OK, fine.  How many S's in "innocent"?
Everyone: Aw.
   Homer: I'm only doing what I think is right.  I believe Freddy Quimby
          should walk out of here a free hotel.
-- You forgot "free shower curtain", 

So it's off to the hotel they go.  Homer talks to Marge on the phone,
mounds of food and garbage surrounding him.

  Homer: [on phone] Aw, I miss you too, Marge.  But the law needs me!
         I'll be home as soon as I can.
          [hangs up, presses a button]
         Room service?  Send up two more pot roasts and three more
         pillows with mints on them.
Skinner: {You know...we're kind of like the original "Odd Couple".
         You're the messy one and I'm the --}
  Homer: {Shut up!}
Skinner: {Oh, yes, very well.}
-- Handle with Kare, indeed, 

At home, Bart watches the end of an Itchy and Scratchy cartoon when Lisa
walks in.

     Lisa: So, Bart, have your insides been gnawed away by guilt yet?
     Bart: Sell it to Hallmark, Sis.  You're looking at Cucumber boy, as
           in "Cool as a".
Announcer: [on TV] Next, on "McGonigle", McGonigle is framed for a crime
           he didn't commit.  And only one person can clear his name: a
           little sissy boy who's too scared to come forward.
McGonigle: You gotta tell 'em what you saw, Billy.
    Billy: But I'm so _scared_, McGonigle.
McGonigle: You gotta do this one for me, Billy: McGonigle.
    Billy: Well, OK.  For you, McGonigle.
    Chief: Well, McGonigle, Billy is dead.  They slit is throat from ear
           to ear.
McGonigle: Hey!  I'm trying to eat lunch here.
-- Negative reinforcement, 

Homer watches "Free Willy" at the hotel.

Homer: Jump, Free Willy.  Jump!  Jump with all your might!
        [on the TV, Willy jumps over a rock barrier as a little boy
       smiles, but a shadow looms on his face and the smile turns to
       fear]
Woman: Oh, no.  Willy didn't make it.  And he crushed our boy!
  Man: Ew.  What a mess.
Homer: Ohh, I don't like this new director's cut.
-- Bemoaning those who control things, 

{Later, Homer uses sheets tied together to lower a table out the
window.}

  Homer: {[lowering a table out the window] Got it, Barn?}
 Barney: {[below] Got what?  [crash] Ow!}
Skinner: {You're stealing a table?}
  Homer: {I'm not stealing it.  Hotels expect you to take a few things.
         It's a souvenir!}
Skinner: {Ah.  Is that my necktie you're wearing?}
  Homer: {Souvenir.}
-- 

Bart is thinking things over at home, and he asks Marge about it as she
dusts the living room.

 Bart: Mom, what if there's a really bad crummy guy who's going to jail
       but I know he's innocent?
Marge: Well, Bart, your uncle Arthur used to have a saying: "Shoot 'em
       all and let God sort 'em out."  Unfortunately, one day put his
       theory into practice.  It took 75 federal marshalls to bring him
       down.  Now let's never speak of him again.
        [hums as she dusts]
 Bart: Mom.  ...Mom.  ...Mom!
Marge: Huh?
 Bart: What if I can get this guy off the hook?  Should -- should I do
       it?
Marge: Honey, you should listen to your heart, and not the voices in
       your head like a certain uncle did one grey December morn.
        [hums some more]
-- Simpson family skeletons, 

Bart must have said something because the judge decides to reopen the
trial.

 Judge: Even though reopening a trial at this point is illegal and
        grossly unconstitutional, I just can't say no to kids.
Lawyer: So, young man, if Freddy Quimby _didn't_ inflict these injuries
        on Mr. LaCoste, just who did?
  Bart: Well, I was hiding in the kitchen when it all happened.
         [flashback]
Freddy: Say it, Frenchy!  Say "chowder"!
Waiter: Never!
Freddy: OK, you asked for it.  I'm going to enjoy this!
         [grunts, pops the cork off some champagne, chugs it]
Waiter: Hah.  [slips on floor, bangs head on four frying pans, breaks
        glass, hand lands in blender, then in toaster, then head falls
        in oven, boiling water is spilled on his back, then into broom
        closet where rat traps snap closed all over him, then beaks more
        glass and falls over]
         [back to reality]
  Bart: And that's what really happened.
Waiter: This is an outrage!  I am not a clumsy Clouseau-esque waiter.  I
        will --
         [trips on chair, falls out window into truck containing rat
        traps]
Waiter: At least, there were no big ones -- [snap] -- aie.
-- Only one big one, it seems, 

   Hutz: How could you have seen all this, Bart?  Weren't you supposed
         to be in school?
   Bart: [slowly] I sort of skipped school.
Skinner: I knew it!  I knew you'd slip up sooner or later, Simpson!
    Apu: What slip up?  What are you talking about?  He confessed it!
Skinner: Quiet, I need this.
-- Apu, accidental lawyer, 

The judge finds Freddy innocent and dismisses the case.  Quimby shakes
his nephew's hand.

Skinner: Bart, I'm impressed with what you did in there.  You testified
         for the Quimby boy even though it was putting your own head in
         a noose.  On the other hand, you skipped school.
   Bart: I guess the two things cancel each other out, huh?
Skinner: [sighs] I'm a small man in some ways, Bart.  A small, petty
         man.  Three months' detention.
   Bart: [groans, {walks away}]
Skinner: {Wait a minute, Bart.  Make that...four months' detention.}
-- 

In their bedroom that night, Homer and Marge lie surrounded by a horde
of souvenirs from the Springfield Palace Hotel.

Homer: Well, Marge, it was horrible.  Everyone was against me in that
       jury room.  But I stood by the courage of my convictions and I
       prevailed.  And that's why we had chinese food for lunch.
Marge: Good for you, Homey!  You know, a lot of things happened around
       here while you were gone.
Homer: Right, Marge, I wanna hear all about it.  [puts on "open eye"
       glasses] Heh heh --
Marge: Gimme those!
Homer: Aw...[snap]
Marge: And those...
Homer: Aw...[snap]
Marge: And those...
Homer: Aw...
-- A new third pair?, 

[End of Act Three.  Time: 20:56]
 EPISODE TITLE: Lady Bouvier's Lover


EPISODE SUMMARY: 
[Syndication cuts are marked in curly braces "{}" and are courtesy of
Ricardo Lafaurie.]

On the Krusty show, Krusty laughs for the children, who cheer for him.
Sideshow Mel, donning a tux, approaches the klown.

   Mel: Please, Krusty: this is very demeaning!
Krusty: Shut up and conduct!
-- Sideshow Mel is forced to lead a band of monkeys, "Lady Bouvier's
    Lover"

Mel conducts a dozen monkeys on kazoos playing a Strauss waltz, but one
of the monkeys stops.  Mel's baton-poking prompts the monkey to lunge
for his throat.  A prone Mel shrieks as the other monkeys join in.

Bart and Lisa laugh uproariously as they watch, as does Homer, who has
Maggie on his lap.

Homer: [watching TV] Maggie, can you point to the monkey?
        [Maggie points at Homer]
       Pfft.  What do babies know?
 Lisa: Maggie, can you point to the credenza?
        [she does so]
Homer: D'oh!
-- She knows zebus as well, 

Marge calls out from the kitchen.

Marge: Homer!  You didn't do a very good job frosting Maggie's birthday
       cake.
Homer: [walking in] What?  [reads lettering] It's not Magaggie's
       birthday?
       Oh.  [eats the extra "a" and "g", then eats other letters]
Marge: Hey, hey, hey, hey!  Stop it.  I made a special cake for you to
       ruin.  It's over there.
Homer: Ooh!  [goes over, picks letters off it]
-- She knows him well, 

The doorbell rings.  Marge answers it with Maggie in her arms.

 Patty: Hello, everybody except Homer.
Jackie: [touching Maggie's nose] Happy birthday, granddaughter.
 Patty: Marge, I think that's your father-in-law across the street.
         [Abe knocks on door]
   Abe: [to black man who answers] Happy Birthday!
-- That's him, all right, 

{With everyone seated at the table, Marge brings Maggie in.}

   Marge: {Everybody get ready!  Here comes the birthday girl, in her
          very first dress.}
Everyone: {Aw!}
   Patty: {She's a little angel.}
   Selma: {Yeah.  I want to put a hook in her and hang her from our
          Christmas tree.}
     Abe: {[loudly] What smells?}
   Marge: {Uh oh.}
-- A wee accident?, 

Everyone sits around a pile of presents as Marge brings the birthday
girl in.  Bart wants to wait for the other babies before opening the
presents, but Lisa explains they didn't invite the other babies because
Maggie doesn't seem to get along with them.  As if on cue, the one-
eyebrowed baby is pushed by in his pram outside.  Spotting each other,
Maggie and he scowl.

Marge picks her up and seats her at the table.

     Marge: Maggie!  We've got a surprise for you.
             [brings in the cake.  Everyone takes photos of her, and
            Maggie gets frightened by the flashbulbs, candle flame, and
            darkened room.  She whimpers]
       Abe: Ooh!  Put some Lister's Carbolic Unguent on a wad of cotton,
            and stick it in her ear!  That'll stop them shakes.
    Jackie: No, no.  What she needs is a balsam specific.
       Abe: Balsam specific?!  Oof!  While we're burning money, why
            don't we give her a curative galvanic belt too.
      Bart: [raspy] Don't forget to give her Smeckler's Powder.
Abe+Jackie: Don't make fun!
-- 

Maggie is put to bed after all the excitement.  Jackie begins to
reminisce.

   Jackie: I remember Lisa's third birthday.  She and Bart did this
           adorable little song and dance routine.
      Abe: Oh, heh heh!  That was a real horn-honker!  Let's see it.
            [Bart and Lisa look at each other]
      Abe: Now!  Do it!
            [Bart and Lisa groan]
      Abe: [threatening] Do it...!
Bart+Lisa: [walk to window, turn around]
            [bored] Hot dogs,
           Armour hot dogs,
      Abe: Sing it like you mean it!  [plays harmonica]
Bart+Lisa: What kind of kids eat Armour hot dogs?
     Bart: [fat voice] Fat kids!
     Lisa: [squeaky voice] Skinny kids!
     Bart: Kids who climb on rocks!
     Lisa: [tough voice] Tough kids!
     Bart: [sissy voice] Sissy kids!
 Milhouse: [spots on his face] Even kids with chicken pox --
 Everyone: -- love hot dogs,
           Armour hot dogs,
           The dogs...kids...love...to...bite!
            [Home walks by with a sign for Armour hot dogs]
     Lisa: Doesn't this family know any songs that aren't commercials?
 Everyone: [Lisa walks off] I feel like Chicken Tonight, like Chicken
           Tonight, like Chicken Tonight...
-- Lisa demonstrates the rhetorical question, 

Afterwards, Jackie and her spinster daughters sit in their car in front
of the house.

       Jackie: It's been great spending time with my family again.  I
               guess the next time I see you won't be until
               Thanksgiving.
        Homer: [sly] Or if not then, Christmas...
          Abe: I suppose I'll be gettin' home too.  At least I got
               Matlock to keep me company.  Oh!  He's on in five
               minutes.
       Jackie: He is?  Step on it!
                [the old folks' bus pulls up]
Crazy old man: [inside] Hurry up, hurry!  Each "Matlock" could be our
               last.
-- A wish before dying, 

Marge is pensive in bed that night.

Marge: Homey, you know, it's funny.  Both my mother and your father seem
       pretty lonely.
Homer: Hee hee hee!  That is funny.
Marge: Yeah.  Anyway, maybe they could go to a matinee together, or
       shopping.  Or to that room in the library that's always full of
       old people?  Um...periodicals!  That's it.
Homer: Marge, please, old people don't need companionship.  They need to
       be isolated and studied so it can be determined what nutrients
       they have that might be extracted for our personal use.
Marge: Homer, would you please stop reading that Ross Perot pamphlet?
-- Stockdale could still surprise us, 

The next day, Marge and Homer pick up Abe, then stop in front of the Hal
Roach apartments where Jackie lives.

Marge: Say, I've got a neat idea!  Why don't you go in and pick up my
       mother and we'll all go out to dinner?
  Abe: I'll be back in a jiffy!
        [comes back with a woman in a wheelchair]
Marge: That's not my mother.
  Abe: I'll be back in a jiffy!
Woman: Can I come too?
        [Homer rolls up Marge's power window]
Woman: [disappointed] Oh...
-- Too many cooks, 

At P. Piggly Hogswine's Super-Smorg restaurant, Marge tries her hand at
matchmaking.

 Marge: You know, Mom, you and Abe have a lot in common.  Um...hmm.  You
        both got swindled by that telemarketing scam!
   Abe: Oh, it's not a swindle.  What you do is, see, you give 'em all
        your credit card numbers, and if one of them is lucky, they'll
        send you a prize.
Jackie: I was just happy to talk to someone on the phone.
   Abe: Aw, feeling blue, eh?  I got something that'll cheer you up.
         [puts forks in two potatoes and makes them dance]
Jackie: [wheezes laughter]
Lawyer: [approaching] Sir, I represent the estate of Charles Chaplin.  I
        have a court order demanding an immediate halt to this
        unauthorized imitation.  Boys?
         [two large men grab the potatoes and forks and stomp on them]
-- 

Later at Jackie's apartment, Jackie shows Abe an old photo of herself on
a beach with her ankles indecently exposed.

Jackie: And here's a picture of me getting arrested for indecent
        exposure.  It was the most embarrassing day of my life.
   Abe: [whistles] Lift those gams.  You were one nifty number!
Jackie: Boys all paid attention to me and it drove my friends crazy.
   Abe: Who were your friends?
Jackie: Oh, Zelda Fitzgerald, Frances Farmer, and little Sylvia Plath.
   Abe: You know, you remind me of a poem I can't remember, and a song
        that may never have existed, and a place I'm not sure I've ever
        been to.
Jackie: You're so sweet...
   Abe: [thinking] Ooh, I feel all funny.  [gasp] I'm in love!  No,
        wait.  It's a stroke.
         [later, in the ambulance]
        No, wait!  It _is_ love!
         [the ambulance halts and the attendants boot him out]
        I'm in love!  [rolls onto highway as cars honk]

[End of Act One.  Time: 6:49]

Bart lies in bed watching a shopping network on a portable TV.

     Troy: Hello, I'm Troy McClure.  You might remember me from such
           films as "The Boatjacking of Supership 79" and "Hydro, the
           Man With the Hydraulic Arms".  Coming up this hour on the
           Impulse Buying Network, your chance to own a piece of Itchy
           and Scratchy, the toontown twosome beloved by everyone --
           even cynical members of Generation X!
  Gen Xer: [watching at home] Pfft, yeah.  "Groovy".
   Meyers: Troy, I'm proud to offer your viewers these hand-drawn Itchy
           and Scratchy animation cels.  Each one is absolutely,
           positively, 100% guaranteed to increase in value.
Announcer: [quickly] Not a guarantee.
-- Checks will not be honored either, 

Bart can hardly resist.  He goes to the step at the top of the stairs
and peeks around the corner waiting for Homer to approach.

       [Bart and Homer run into each other]
 Bart: Pardon me, sir.  Forgive my clumsiness.
Homer: Not at all.
 Bart: [chuckles, holding Homer's wallet]
Homer: [chuckles, holding Bart's slingshot]
 Bart: [on phone] Uh, yes.  My name is Homer Simpson, and I'd like to
       order an Itchy and Scratchy cel...my credit card?  Uh, do you
       accept a Federal Breast Inspector's card?  License to Ogle?
       Vysa?...Oh, yes, of course.  That's what I meant, _Visa_.  It's
       these new dentures.
-- Dentures paid for on Vysa, no doubt, 

Later at dinner, everyone pigs out as usual.

Marge: Well I think it's wonderful that your father has fallen in love
       with my mother.
Homer: Well I'm opposed to the whole thing.  Damn opposed!
 Bart: He's damn opposed.  Damn, damn, _damn_ opposed!
Marge: Bart!  Homer, what possible reason could you have against Grampa
       being in love?
Homer: If he marries your mother, Marge, we'll be brother and sister.
       And then our kids...they'll be horrible freaks with pink skin, no
       overbites, and five fingers on each hand!
        [Homer imagines the freakish kids]
       Aaah!
-- They'd be almost...human, 

Marge decides to call her mother.

 Marge: Hello, Mom?...Fine.  You know, Abe had a very nice time with you
        last Sunday --
   Abe: Tell her I love her!
 Marge: [covering mouthpiece] Grampa, shh!  I know my mother.  If you
        come on too strong, she's going to get scared away!
   Abe: [runs to other phone] I love ya!
Jackie: What?
 Marge: Er, I love you, Mom!
   Abe: I love you, I love you --
         [Marge joins in saying "I love you"]
 Marge: -- I love you.  I love you, Mom, gotta go!
-- No telemarketing skill at all, 

{The doorbell rings, and Bart answers it expectantly.}

          {[Bart answers the door]}
     Man: {Yeah, hi.  I got a special delivery for Homer Simpson.}
    Bart: {That's me!}
     Man: {[punches Bart in the face] Don't write no more letters to Mr.
          Sinatra.}
          {[doorbell rings; Bart answers it]}
Teenager: {I got a special delivery for Homer Simpson.}
    Bart: {Uh, that's me.}
Teenager: {[punches Bart in the face] Stop stealing golf balls from the
          driving range!}
          {[doorbell rings]}
     Man: {[through door] Homer Simpson!  I've got a, uh, special
          delivery for you.}
    Bart: {Go away!}
     Man: {If you do not open the door, Mr. Simpson, I cannot give you
          your...special delivery.}
          {[Bart looks through mail slot, sees man holding animation cel
          rolled in cardboard]}
    Bart: {[sighs with relief] [opens door]}
     Man: {Here's your special delivery.}
    Bart: {Thanks --}
     Man: {[punches Bart in the face] And that's for keeping me
          waiting.}
-- Three for three, 

Bart can't contain his excitement

Bart: Hey, Lis!  Guess who's got a genuine Itchy and Scratchy animation
      cel?
Lisa: Oh!  That is so cool!  That is so exciting!  That is so --
       [Bart pulls it out]
      -- crappy.  It looks like part of Scratchy's arm.
Bart: Oh, no.  I used Dad's credit card to buy this!
Lisa: Yeesh.  How much was it?
Bart: $350.
Lisa: Ooh...
       [a ghostly Nelson at Bart's shoulder saying "Ha ha!"]
       [at the Kwik-E-Mart, Nelson writhes on the floor]
 Apu: Oh my God.  This boy is having an out-of-body experience.  This is
      very...bad for business.
-- The proper response, 

That night at the Simpson house, Abe and Homer sit together on the
couch.  Abe, sharply dressed, awaits the arrival of his new belle.

  Abe: Hot diggety!  I'm going to smooch her like a mule eating an
       apple!  [demonstrates] I even bought me some special novelty
       dentures.  [turns off light] See?  [smiles.  Dentures glow, "Kiss
       me, sweetie!"]
Homer: Dad, that will never work.  If you want to make your move, you
       got to play it...cool.  [jazz bass and cymbals start playing]
        [to the beat] Now what you gotta do
       If you wanna get a kiss
       Is act real smooth
       And make your move like this:
        [stands up, stretches and yawns, and sits down again, arm still
       outstretched so it lands around Abe's shoulder]
  Abe: Oh, I see!
        [to the beat] So if I take your advice
       And make your patented move,
       Then my chances for love
       Will slightly improve?
        [does the Homer move]
Homer: [giggles] Now what's that rule?
  Abe: Play it cool.  [music stops]
        [doorbell rings.  Abe panics, jumps behind the couch]
-- Real cool, just like that, 

Abe takes Jackie to a seniors' dance.  Meanwhile, Bart, tries to pawn
his cel at the comic store.

  Bart: Is this cel worth anything?  [gives him cel with arm on it]
Dealer: [looks at it, sighs] Let me show you something.  This -- this is
        a Snagglepuss drawn by Hic Heisler.  It is worth something.
        This -- this is an arm, drawn by nobody.  It is worth nothing.
  Bart: Can't you give me anything for it.
Dealer: I can give you this telephone.  It is shaped like Mary Worth.
  Bart: Oh...
Dealer: No groaning in my store.
-- Or was that "no Groening"?, 

At the dance, Red Breem, the band leader, cues Glenn Miller's "Moonlight
Serenade".  Jackie dances closer to Abe.

Jackie: Oh, my favorite song.  This is so nice!
   Abe: I can't remember when I felt this young.  Oh...I really can't!
         [they almost kiss]
 Burns: Say, sport!  Mind if I have the next dance?
   Abe: [stammers] What the --?  Don't sneak up on a -- oh, you --
 Burns: No need for the blown gasket, Charlie.  I'll have her back in
        one piece.
         ["Sing, Sing, Sing" begins.  Burns dances up a storm with
        Jackie]
   Abe: Grr.  That big ape thinks he can muscle in on my girl, does he?
        I'm gonna give him the frowning of a lifetime!  [does so]
         [Monty and Jackie dance on, oblivious]
-- Not much of a revenge, 

Abe sits on a park bench across the street when Monty and Jackie leave
the dance together.

        [Burns and Jackie laugh]
Jackie: I swear, Monty: you are the devil himself!
 Burns: I -- [yelling] who told yo -- oh, ho ho, I, yes, yes, well, I'd
        say you're an angel, but angels don't dance like that.
-- They've never flown so low either, 

Smithers arrives in Burns' limo.  He growls as he opens the door for
Burns' new date.  The car screeches off.  Abe walks off slowly down the
street through the pools of light cast by the street lamps.

   Abe: Good night, Mrs. Bouvier...wherever you are.
Lawyer: [approaching] Mr. Simpson, I represent the estate of Jimmy
        Durante.  I have a court order demanding an immediate halt of
        this unauthorized imitation.  Boys?
         [two large men grab Abe's hat and stomp on it.  The three
        leave]
   Abe: Well, would it be all right with you if I just laid down in the
        street and died?
Lawyer: [off-camera, shuffles papers] Yes, that would be acceptable.
-- 

[End of Act Two.  Time: 13:39]

Burns is jubilant in his office the next day.

   Burns: Smithers, guess what happened to me last night?
Smithers: I don't know, sir.  You had sex with that old woman?
   Burns: She said "no" to me!  Do you know how many women have said
          "no" to me?  One hundred thirty, but only one since I've
          become a billionaire.  And _she's_ the one for me.  I'm in
          love!  [Smithers groans]
Smithers: Whoop-de-do, sir.
   Burns: Yes, whoop-de-do!  Whoop-de-do to the world.  Whoop-de-do, Mr.
          Florist.  Whoop-de-do, Mr. Physical Trainer.  Whoop-de-do, Mr.
          President!
 Clinton: I'm happy you finally found love.
   Burns: Whoop-de-do, Tarantula Town!  [grabs PA mike] Whoop-de-do,
          employees!  Everyone who's found true love may leave early
          today!
Everyone: Yay!  [run off, except one man, who cries]
-- Being singled-out, 

Burns decides to write Jackie a love-letter.

   Burns: [grabbing paper] "Memorandum to Mrs. Bouvier, re: Delineation
          of Romantic Intentions" -- pfft, too sappy.  Smithers, come
          over here and help me write a mash note to my girlfriend.
Smithers: [rolls eyes] Fine.  "Darling one, read my words and hear my
          heart speak of a love soft and undying: a love that will be
          with you always.  Sincerely," yatta, yatta, yatta.
   Burns: That's marvelous!  How did you think of that so fast?
Smithers: I [sobs] sent it to you on your birthday!  [cries] Excuse me,
          I have something in my eye!
-- Just like watching "Bambi", 

At the Simpson home, Marge walks down the stairs to join Homer.

Marge: Mom's almost ready for her date.  She sure seems taken by this
       new beau.  I feel so bad for Grampa.
Homer: Dad says this new guy's a repulsive, obnoxious old billionaire.
       So let's all be extra-nice to him.
        [doorbell rings; Homer answers it]
        [Marge and Homer scream]
Burns: Hello!  Why it's -- it's, er -- oh, it's er -- [goes back,
       whispers to Smithers.  Smithers whispers back and chuckles]
       Why, it's Fred Flintstone and his lovely wife Wilma!  Oh, and
       this must be little Pebbles.  [pats Maggie] Mind if I come in?
       I've brought chocolates.
Homer: [grabbing them] Yabba dabba doo!
-- The modern stone-age family, 

Marge sits at the kitchen table with Homer, angry at Monty.

Marge: He's an awful, awful, _awful_ man!  I guess if he makes Mom
       happy, that's all that really matters.
Homer: That's right, money.  Your money's happiness is all that moneys.
-- Subliminal suggestions, 

Bart spies Mr. Burns, and an idea forms in his devious little mind.

  Bart: You know, Gramma really likes it when her boyfriends are nice to
        me...she 'specially likes it when they give me money.
 Burns: Run along, Pee Wee.  Baby gets nothing!
  Bart: Very well.  You leave me no choice.  This gun is filled with
        ketchup, this one with mustard.  Now gimme three hundred fifty
        bucks or you're going to be a mess for your date.
 Burns: [ominous] You don't have the guts.
         [they stare each other down; Bart squirts him]
 Burns: Eww!  Here, take your money, take it!  [Bart drops a gun] Ooh,
        now the tables have turned, haven't they?
Jackie: [coming down stairs] Monty, I'm ready!  [sees Burns, gasps]
         [Bart runs off]
-- Bad second impressions, 

Abe sits in the nursing home, dejected, looking at Jackie's photo.

   Abe: Oh, why'd she have to leave me?
Jasper: [walking in] Hi, Abe!  We heard you was in need of some cheering
        up.  We got you a special cake.  ["cheer up Abe"]
         [coughing comes from inside the cake]
Jasper: [looking in] Uh oh.  Better call the nurse.
-- Geriatric disasters, 

{Burns takes Jackie to an Italian restaurant.  Luigi, the chef, finishes
playing a serenade on the violin.}

 Burns: {Bravissimo, Luigi!  Bring us your finest bottle of vino!}
 Luigi: {Hey, you trust-ah Luigi, huh?  He knows-ah what for to make-ah
        really nice the amore.}
Jackie: {Oh, Monty, I've never been to a more romantic restaurant.}
 Luigi: {[entering kitchen] Hey, Salvatore!  Break out the cheap hooch
        for Mr. No-Tip and the dried-up-ah zombie he's-ah captured!}
-- Romance, my butt, 

Bart sees Homer walk by his bedroom and decides come clean about the cel
purchase.

    Bart: Dad, I'm really sorry, but I charged $350 on your credit card.
   Homer: What?!
    Bart: Don't worry, here's the cash!
   Homer: Woo-hoo!  $350.  Now I can buy seventy transcripts of
          Nightline!  Hee hee.
    Bart: But Dad -- oh well, he's happy.  I'm going to keep the Mary
          Worth phone right here.  Her stern but sensible face will
          remind me never to do anything so stupid again.
           [it rings; Bart answers it]
Milhouse: Hey Bart, you want to go play with that X-ray machine in the
          abandoned hospital?
    Bart: Sure...
-- Worked for two seconds, 

Monty and Jackie picnic at a remote spot with mountains in the
background.

 Monty: [dropping a ring into a champagne glass] Now, my dear, if you
        look in your champagne, I think you'll find a little surprise --
         [Jackie drinks it, swallows the ring, and chokes a little]
        Heh, uh, not to worry, I believe there's another one around here
        somewhere -- [reaches into boiling fondue, burns himself]
         [kneeling] My darling, since my kneecaps are filling with fluid
        as we speak.  Will you marry me?
         [cut to Marge in the kitchen with Jackie]
 Marge: Oh, Mom, you can't marry Mr. Burns.  He's an evil man.
Jackie: Evil, schmevil, Marge!  Monty can provide for me.  Besides, he's
        a great kisser.
 Homer: Ew, yuck!
 Marge: What about Abe Simpson?  Don't you have any feelings for him?
Jackie: Oh, he's a dear.  But he's too much of an old fusspot.
 Marge: We're all aware of Grampa's problems, but compared to Mr. Burns,
        he's Judge freaking Reinhold!
Jackie: [pause] I don't know who that is.
-- A lost comparison, 

Abe wanders down the street, trying to console himself.

Abe: Aw, who needs her?  Now I'll have more time to read things I find
     on the ground.  [picks something up] "La...tex...con...do"...boy,
     I'd like to live in one of those!
-- I don't think so, 

Just then he spies Jackie trying on her wedding dress in a bridal salon,
and he runs off.

It's wedding day at the First Church of Springfield.  When Barney
arrives, Homer suggests he sit on the groom's side since the bride's
side is packed.  Barney screams "Down in front" at the only other
person.  The man (who wears a Kaiser helmet) shouts back, "Nein!"

The bridal chorus plays.  Lisa the flower girl and Bart the ring-bearer
walk down the aisle together.

Lisa: Where's Grampa?  Wasn't he invited?
Bart: Yeah, but his reply envelope just had a check to the gas company
      in it.
-- The perils of age, 

Marge and Smithers walk down the aisle, scowling, followed by Homer and
Selma.  Rev. Lovejoy reads a passage from the bible.

Lovejoy: And so when Eliphaz came down from Mount Hebron bearing figs,
         he offered them to Mohem, who you will remember is the father
         of Sheckhom, and to Hazar on the occasion of their matrimony,
         much in the same --
  Burns: We've heard enough about Bliz-Blaz and Him-Ham already.  Get to
         the bloody point!
          [Marge elbows Jackie, "Hmm?  Hmm?"]
Lovejoy: Do you, Charles Montgomery Burns, take this woman to be your
         lawfully wedded wife?
  Burns: I do.
          [Bart bumbles with the ring and drops it]
         The ring, you little imbecile, before I really lose my temper!
          [kicks Bart.  Marge elbows Jackie]
 Jackie: I know, I know.  Ow!  Ow!  [Burns forces the ring on]
          [Marge scowls]
Lovejoy: Do you, Jacqueline Bouvier, take this man to be your lawfully
         wedding husband?
          ["Moonlight Serenade" starts on the organ]
 Jackie: Oh, Monty, my favorite song!  How did --
  Burns: I specifically requested _no_ romantic music!  What --
-- A real charmer, 

From the organist's booth, Abe calls out, "Mrs. Bouvier!" as he pounds
on the window.  Glass breaks and Abe falls to the floor face first.

   Abe: Honey!  Are you sure you want to be Mrs. Montgomery Burns?
        Wouldn't you rather be Mrs. Abraham J. Simpson?
Jackie: No!
   Abe: [gulps] [Burns grins]
Jackie: I don't want to be either!
   Abe: Hot ziggety zam!  That's good enough for me!
         [skips down the aisle with her, arm in arm, and onto the bus to
        the retirement home]
         [guitar music plays]
   Abe: Turn off that racket!
  Otto: Yeah, fat chance, Pops.
-- Otto, always the sympathetic one, 

[End of Act Three.  Time: 21:15]

Over the credits, a duo sings over "The Sound of Silence":

Hello Grampa, my old friend,
Your busy day is at an end.
Your exploits have been sad and boring,
They tell a tale that's worth ignoring.
When you're alone, the words of your story
Will echo down the rest-home hall,
[in syndication, the screen divides here {rl}]
{'Cause no one at all can stand
The sound of Grampa.}

Abe begins to tell a story, "{I first took a fancy to Mrs. Bouvier
because her raspy voice} reminded me of my old Victrola.  Oh, it was a
fine machine with a vulcanized rubber listening tube which you crammed
in your ear.  The tube would go in easier with some sort of lubricant
like linseed oil or Dr. --", but he's interrupted by the "Shh!" of the
"Gracie Films" woman.  "Oh, I'm sorry," he apologizes.

 EPISODE TITLE: Secrets of a Successful Marriage


EPISODE SUMMARY: 
[Syndication cuts are marked in curly braces "{}" and are courtesy of
Frederic Briere.]

It's poker night at Lenny's house.

   Moe: All right, I raise a quarter.
  Carl: I'm out.
 Lenny: I'm out.
Barney: I'm out.  Whoa -- [passes out; chair tips over]
   Moe: Homer, you want any cards?  [Homer gags] Homer!
         [hits Homer; he coughs up a blue chip]
 Homer: Whoo!  Don't try to eat these so-called "chips".
-- A special warning just because of him, "Secrets of a Successful
    Marriage"

Lenny: You want another card or not?
Homer: Huh?  Oh, OK.  I'll take three.  [Moe deals them] D'oh!  D'oh!
       D'oh!  I mean...woo hoo.
  Moe: I'm in.  [tosses a chip into the pot] Let's see your cards.
Homer: Oh, I was bluffing.  [shows them]
  Moe: Ha ha.  Come to papa -- wait a minute!  You have a straight
       flush, Homer!  You do this every time, you -- oh, you -- oh!
       Gah!  I'm choking on my own rage here.
 Carl: Hey, don't yell at Homer.  Just 'cause he's a little slow...
Homer: [gasps] [thinks] Something was said...not good.  What was it?
       "Don't yell at Homer!"  No, that's OK.  What was it?  ...Slow!
       They called you slow!
        [stands up, yells] How dare you call me that!  I -- huh?
        [Lenny walks into empty kitchen wearing night cap]
Lenny: [opens fridge] Hey, Homer, you still here?  Boy, you _are_ slow.
Homer: [thinks] Something said...not good.
Lenny: Get the hell out of here!
-- All the power of his brain, 

Lenny boots him out.

Homer tells the family about it at a meal the next day.

Homer: So anywho, last night we're playing poker, right?  As usual, I'm
       winning and not realizing it, and Lenny says that I'm, er --
       [laughs] -- get this -- [laughs] -- a little slow!  [laughs a
       lot] [stops] How come you're not laughing?  Do you think I'm
       slow?
 Bart: Buh.  [looks away]
 Lisa: Sla.  [looks away]
        [Maggie sucks her pacifier]
Marge: {Uh, we don't think you're slow.  On the other hand, it's not
       like you go to museums or read books or anything.}
Homer: {You think I don't want to?  It's those TV networks, Marge: they
       won't let me.  One quality show after another, each one fresher
       and more brilliant than the last.  If they only stumbled once,
       just gave us thirty minutes to ourselves, [puts head on table,
       pounds fist] but they won't!  They won't let me live!  [sobs]}
-- Six hours of TV a day, 

That night, Homer sits on the end of the bed and comes to a realization.

Homer: Oh, who am I kidding?  I _am_ slow.
Marge: Oh, Homey, if you feel so bad about yourself, there's always
       things you can do to feel better.
Homer: Take another bath in malt liquor?
Marge: There's that...or you could take an adult education course.
Homer: Oh, and how is "education" supposed to make me feel smarter?
       Besides, every time I learn something new, it pushes some old
       stuff out of my brain.  Remember when I took that home wine-
       making course and I forgot how to drive?
Marge: That's because you were drunk!
Homer: And how.
-- Something to be really proud of, 

So Homer decides to head down to the adult education center.  He walks
down the hall past the classrooms.  The first one features Patty and
Selma teaching how to melt their men.  "One way to drive your man wild
is to wear tight, revealing clothes," explains Patty.  Selma walks out
in red lingerie -- at which the women in the class gasp in horror.  "At
this point, I'd like to remind you there are no refunds," Patty
continues, lighting a cigarette.

{In the next class, Moe teaches gangsta rapper self-defense.  "All
right, here's the 4-1-1, folks.  Say some gangsta is dissin' your fly
girl.  You just give 'em one of these."  A rap beat begins and Moe
begins to break.  After a backflip, he grabs a shotgun at blasts three
rounds into the air -- much to the surprise and discomfort of his
students.}

In the next class, Lenny teaches tobacco spitting.  He horks a huge wad
at the spittoon where it lands with a resounding ping.  "See, that
'ping' sound means the spit was on target.  Now you try?"  Everybody
does, but most slobber instead.  Abe's false teeth fall out, but Lenny
is encouraging: "Getting better."

Homer: Wait a minute...even Lenny is teaching a class!  Look at the way
       they admire and adore him.
        [everyone drools 'baccy, dreamily watching Lenny]
       That's it.  If he can teach a class, _he_ can teach a class -- I
       mean, _I_ can teach a class!
        [in the Administrator's office]
Admin: What is your area of expertise?
Homer: Well, I can tell the difference between butter and "I Can't
       Believe It's Not Butter!"
Admin: No you can't, Mr. Simpson!  No one can.
Homer: Oh, I've failed again.  Everyone can teach a class but me.  I'm
       an idiot!  What am I going to tell my wife and kids?
Admin: Oh, you're married?
Homer: That depends...is there another way to get this job?  [blinks
       engagingly]
Admin: No...Mr. Simpson, what I mean is, we may have a job for you after
       all.  We need someone to teach a course on how to build a
       successful marriage.
Homer: I'll do it.  _Anything_ to get me out of that house away from all
       that nagging, and noise...of a family of love.  Sha na na na...
-- Quickly backpedaling, 

Homer brags to his family about his new job.

Homer: Look, everyone: now that I'm a teacher, I've sewed patches on my
       elbows!  [shows his elbow]
Marge: Homer, that's supposed to be _leather_ patches on a _tweed_
       blazer, not that other way around!  You've ruined a perfectly
       good jacket!
Homer: Ah -- incorrect, Marge.  _Two_ perfectly good jackets.
        [holds up jacket with patches cut out of the back]
-- At least he can add one and one, 

Lisa offers her support and encouragement.

 Lisa: _I_ think it's great you're a teacher, Dad.  So, will be you
       lecturing from a standardized text or using the more socratic
       method of interactive class participation?
Homer: [pause]
        [condescending] Yes, Lisa.  Daddy's a teacher.
-- Slow?  Nah, 

That night, Homer drives to his first class.

        [Homer drives to Flanders' house; rings doorbell]
   Ned: Well, Homer, what a pleasant --
 Homer: Can't talk now, Flanders.  _I've_ got a class to teach.
   Ned: Heh, but you rang my --
         [Homer speeds away.  He stops at a Krusty Burger Drive-Thru]
   Kid: Can I take your order?
 Homer: Nothing for me today.  _I've_ got a class to teach.
   Kid: Sir, it's a felony to tease the order box.
         [Homer speeds away.  Goes through a red light at an
        intersection; cars skid around him]
 Homer: It's all right!  I'm a teacher.
Hoover: I didn't know we could do that!  [speeds through light]
-- You can, but not legally, 

In the classroom, Homer squeaks the chalk over everyone's protests as he
writes the name of the course on the blackboard.

  Homer: All right.  The first thing they told me to do was to make sure
         everyone here is in the right class.  [gets tobacco spat on
         him] Down the hall, room twelve.
    Man: [mouth full] Thank you.
  Homer: [gets more spat on him] Ew.  OK, let's get started.
         Uh...um...umm...hmm.
  Woman: [whispers to classmate]
  Homer: [pointing] No talking!  [clears throat] Uh...{hmm.  Hmm.
         Oh!...hmm...no.  Uh...hmm.}
Skinner: Um, how about if we tell you about our problems with
         relationships?
  Homer: Yeah...yeah!  That'll eat up some time.
-- Really earning his pay as a teacher, "Secrets of a Successful
    Marriage"

Homer calls on Otto first.

    Otto: My standards are just too high, you know?  I feel like
          nobody's good enough for me.
           [a flea falls from his hair] Oh.  You think you got 'em all,
          but you forget about the eggs!
    Hutz: My problem is I'm a real user of women.  I move in right away
          and stay until the money's gone.
    Edna: Well I'm a smart woman, but I make bad choices.
           [Hutz whispers to her]
          Oh, ho ho ho.  OK, here's a set of house keys and my ATM card.
Smithers: Um, I was married once, but, er, I just didn't know how to
          keep it together.
           [black &amp; white flashback to Southern Belle on a bed]
   Belle: Come on, Waylon.  Make love to me the way you used to!
Smithers: [pouring a drink] No!
   Belle: It's that horrible Mr. Burns, isn't it?
Smithers: [screaming] You leave Mr. Burns out of this!
           [sweeps drinks off table]
   Burns: [outside] Smithers!  [Smithers walks out joyfully] Smithers!
-- Many a Springfieldian skeleton, 

Back in the present, Smithers isn't convinced he has Homer's undivided
attention.

Smithers: Mr. Simpson, are you listening?
           [Homer eats an orange]
          Simpson?!
   Homer: Huh?  Yeah, I was listening.  Very funny.
     Moe: Oh, you were not!  You were just eating a damn orange.
   Homer: Well, yes, yes, to the untrained eye, I'm eating an orange,
          But to the eye that has brains, I'm making a point about
          marriage!  For you see, marriage is a lot like an orange.
          First, you have the skin...then the sweet, sweet innards...
          [devours it]
     Apu: I don't understand...?
   Willy: {If I wanted to see a man eat an orange, I would have taken
          the orange-eating class!
           [in the orange-eating class]}
    Hans: {The eating of an orange is a lot like a good marriage.}
     Abe: {Just eat the damn oranges!}
-- Oranges and marriage: an unusual parallel, "Secrets of a Successful
    Marriage"

Having had it with Homer's class, everyone gets up to leave, muttering
about the deplorable learning conditions.

  Homer: [seeing everyone leaving] Oh, I told Marge this wouldn't work
         the other night in bed!
          [everyone hears "bed", turns around, interested]
    Moe: So something wasn't working in bed, huh?  Heh heh heh.
  Homer: No, that's not what I meant!  Marge and I always talk things
         over in bed.  Like the other night we were fighting about
         money.
Skinner: Ooh, a fight!
    Moe: Trouble in paradise, huh?  Heh heh heh.
  Homer: I was telling Marge we could save some money if she only dyed
         her hair once a month.
   Edna: [gasps] Marge dyes her hair?
  Homer: Oh, yeah.  She's been as grey as a mule since she was
         seventeen.
-- Her name wasn't Brian McGee, however, "Secrets of a Successful
    Marriage"

Homer has everyone's attention now.  After class, he relates the story
to the Krusty Burger Drive-Thru kid.

 Homer: I went on for hours, and they were hanging on my every word!  I
        really think I was born to teach.
Wiggum: [pulls up, draws gun] All right, Simpson!  You were warned about
        teasing box.
 Homer: Aah!  [drives away]
   Kid: Wait!  I need closure on that anecdote.
-- 

[End of Act One.  Time: 9:05]

Marge purchases a few items from Apu at the Kwik-E-Mart.

  Apu: Oh, Mrs. Simpson: it may interest to you to know we're having a
       sale on blue dye #52.  It is your hair color, I believe.
Marge: Whatever do you mean?  I don't die my hair.  [sheepish laughter]
  Moe: Naw, naw, you got it wrong, 'pu.  She's blue #56.
Marge: I don't know what you're talking about.  [walks off]
 Edna: We just love your husband's class.
Marge: [driving away] That's nice...
-- A fine cover-up, 

That night, before bed, Marge decides to chat with Homer.

Marge: Homer, I really don't like you telling personal secrets in your
       class.
Homer: Marge, I didn't tell 'em personal stuff.
Marge: Today at the Kwik-E-Mart everybody knew I dyed my hair!
Homer: Oh, you mean about you.  All right, maybe I said some things,
       some personal things.  But you should have seen them, Marge: they
       really wanted to hear what I had to say --
Marge: Mmm, I'm happy about that.  But I think you can be a good teacher
       and still respect our privacy.
Homer: Look, Marge, you don't know what it's like.  _I'm_ the one out
       there every day putting his ass on the line.  And I'm not out of
       order!  _You're_ out of order.  The whole freaking _system_ is
       out of order.  You want the truth?  You want the truth?!  You
       can't handle the truth!  'Cause when you reach over and put your
       hand into a pile of goo that was your best friend's face, you'll
       know what to do!  Forget it, Marge, it's Chinatown.
Marge: Homer, don't _ever_ tell them personal stuff about me again!
Homer: [meek] Yes ma'am.
-- High reference density, 

Homer tries to abide by Marge's dictum the next evening.

  Homer: Now, what is a wedding?  Well, Webster's Dictionary describes a
         wedding as, "The process of removing weeds from one's garden."
          [everyone groans]
    Moe: Tell us more about you and Marge!
  Homer: This is a place of learning, not a house of...hearing about
         things.
          [everyone starts to leave]
  Woman: I guess he's run out of stories.
Skinner: What a rip-off.
   Otto: I can't believe I paid $10,000 for this course!  What the heck
         was that lab fee for?
-- The not-so-captive audience, 

Homer thinks fast, entreating everyone to wait.

Homer: I _do_ have a story about two other young marrieds...
        [everyone turns back and sits down]
       Now, the wife of this couple has an interesting quirk in the
       bedroom.  It seems she goes wild with desire if her husband
       nibbles on her elbow.
 Edna: We need names!
Homer: Well, let's just call them, uh, Mr. X and Mrs. Y. So anyway, Mr.
       X would say, "Marge, if this doesn't get your motor running, my
       name isn't Homer J. Simpson."
        [everyone gasps delightedly]
-- Anonymity?  Hah!, 

The next day, around dinner time, Marge is surprised Homer hasn't left
yet.

Marge: Oh, Homer, don't you have to get to class?
Homer: Not tonight, Marge.  Tonight, we can eat a nice leisurely dinner
       at home.
Marge: Oh, well that will be lov -- [gasps] What the darn --
Homer: Marge, you'll never guess what: my whole class is here!  They're
       going to observe the human peep-show that is our lives.
  Mel: Apparently, that disturbing odor _was_ the food.
-- Not boding well, exactly, 

While Homer's class stands around with notepads, Homer tries to act
normal, but everyone else in the family scowls at him.

Homer: So, little Lisa, apple of my eye: how are things down at the old
       schoolhouse?
 Lisa: I find this demeaning and embarrassing beyond my worst
       nightmares.
Homer: [hearty laughter] And how's my little major-leaguer?  Catch any
       junebugs today?
 Bart: Oh, me and Milhouse took some mail from the mail truck and threw
       it down the sewer.
Homer: Son, I know you meant well, but that wasn't the right thing to
       do.
 Bart: What the hell are you talking about?  You're the one who double-
       dared us.
Homer: Why you little -- [strangles Bart]
-- Homer has his class over to observe dinner, "Secrets of a Successful
    Marriage"

 Bart: I'm outta here!
 Lisa: Me too.  [they both leave]
Homer: Well, now that the little ones have toddled off to bed --
Marge: [slowly] I want this to end _now_!
  Moe: Hey Homer, why don't you just nibble her elbow?  That always
       melts her butter, right?  [mocking laughter]
Marge: [gasps] All right, OK.  Everybody out!
  Apu: Ooh, she's gotta have it!
Marge: Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out out out out --
       [rushes everyone to the door]
Homer: All right, we're breaking early tonight, class.  For tomorrow,
       you should read pages seven through eighteen in Lisa's diary.
Marge: You too.
Homer: Huh?
Marge: Get out!
Homer: But I'm not in the class --
        [Marge tosses Homer out and slams the door]
 Otto: Is any of this going to be on the test?  'Cause I wasn't paying
       attention.
-- 

[End of Act Two.  Time: 13:16]

Homer wails at the door for Marge.

Homer: Come on, Marge, let me in!  There's crickets out here.
        [Marge opens the door, glares]
       OK, Marge.  Things were said, mistakes were made.  Let's end this
       madness and get on with our lives.
Marge: You just don't get it, do you, Homer?  You told personal things
       about our lives even after your promised you wouldn't.  I can't
       trust you any more.
Homer: But I learned my lesson!  It'll never happen again.
  Ned: [leaning from his window] Hey, Homer, what's the big brouhaha-ha?
Homer: Aw, Marge is throwing me out for blabbing about her elbow thing
       --
        [Marge slams the door]
       Honey, the door blew shut...oh, fine.  If that's what you want,
       you've got it.  [walks off] This scene is gettin' old, man.  I'm
       hittin' the road!  Maybe I'll drop you a line someday from
       wherever I end up in this crazy old world.
-- Homer gets booted out once again, 

Marge decides to explain things to the kids.

Marge: Kids, your father and I are going through a really tough time
       right now, and I don't know what's going to happen.  But just
       remember both your Mom and your Dad love you very, very much.
       [walks off]
 Bart: Wow, I've never seen Mom so mad at Homer before.
 Lisa: I'll tell you a secret, Bart: every time I'm worried about Mom
       and Dad, I go to the attic and add to my ball of string.
        [said ball is huge; it crushes Snowball II]
-- The radius of Lisa's worry, 

Bart and Milhouse play outside the next day.

    Bart: Earthbase?  This is commander Bart McCool.  We are under
          attack by the Zornid Brain Changers!  Quickly, into the safety
          dome, Milbot!
Milhouse: [monotonic] Affirmative, humanoid.
           [the two climb up to Bart's treehouse]
Together: [seeing Homer] Ew!
   Homer: Don't mind me, boys, just scrubbing my undies.
Milhouse: Sorry, Bart.  Your dad kind of blew the fantasy.  I only like
          it when I'm pretend-scared.
   Homer: Keep up the roughhousing, son!  Without a strong male presence
          in the house, you could turn sissy overnight!  Oh, these
          stubborn grass stains.
-- Kind of like that, huh?, 

Shortly thereafter, Homer sees Rev. Lovejoy and his wife walking towards
the door of the house.

       Homer: Oh, good.  Reverend Lovejoy will make Marge take me back!
              He _has_ to push the sanctity of marriage, or his God will
              punish him!
               [inside]
Rev. Lovejoy: Get a divorce.
Mrs. Lovejoy: Mmm hm.
       Marge: But isn't that a sin?
Rev. Lovejoy: Marge, _everything_ is a sin.  You ever sat down and read
              this thing?  [holds up a bible] Technically, we're not
              allowed to go to the bathroom.
-- Thou shalt not...pass water?, 

That night in bed, Marge reaches over to put her arm around Homer, but
she only feels the form of his indentation in the mattress.  In the
treehouse, Homer kisses a picture frame of his beloved wife, lamenting
that he didn't use any of the ten years of his marriage to take a
photograph to put in the frame.

The next day, Marge drives down Main St. in the car, thinking about
Homer as she reads the names of the stores she passes.  She hears
Homer's ghostly voice in fragments..."I love you...Will you marry me
Marge?...You mean I'm going to be a daddy?...I hope we'll always be
together...together...together..." She sees Homer in the back seat
speaking to her through a cardboard roll, and the skids, throwing Homer
out.

Lisa climbs the ladder to Bart's treehouse.

 Lisa: Here Dad, I brought you some nice -- aah!
        [sees Homer with a potted plant]
Homer: Good news, Lisa: I don't need your mother any more!  I've created
       a replacement for her that's superior in almost every way.
       [clips some branches]
 Lisa: Dad, that's just a plant.
Homer: [aghast] Lisa!  You will respect your new mother.  Now give her a
       kiss.  Kiss her!
        [drops plant; it smashes on the ground]
Homer: Omigod omigod omigod!  [pants] All right, let's get out story
       straight: she tripped, right?
 Lisa: [forced happiness] Look, I brought you some nice pudding!
Homer: Ah, your flesh mother used to bring me pudding.
-- Quick diversion of attention, 

Homer: Oh, I miss Marge.  Lisa, you're smart; help me trick her into
       taking me back!
 Lisa: Dad, you can't trick somebody into loving you.  There's a reason
       two people come together and stay together: there's something
       they give each other that nobody else can give them.  If you want
       to get Mom back, you just have to remember what you give her that
       nobody else can.
Homer: [pause] I'll bet you $40 if you think of it for me.
 Lisa: No!
Homer: OK, thirty.
 Lisa: Good luck, Dad.  [leaves]
Homer: All right, Brain, it's all up to you.  If you don't think of what
       it is, we'll lose Marge forever.
Brain: {Eat the pudding eat the pudding eat the pudding eat the pudding
       eat the pudding eat the pudding eat the pudding eat the pudding}
       --
Homer: {OK.  But then we gotta get to work.
        [pigs out]}
-- A literal one-track mind, 

Marge still pines for Homer inside the house when the doorbell rings.

       [Marge answers the door]
  Moe: Oh, h -- hi, Marge.  I heard you and Homer broke up so I'm
       declaring my intentions to move in on his territory.  Here, I,
       uh...brung you some posies.
Marge: Oh, my!  I'm very flattered, but I'm not really interested.
  Moe: Jeez, I come here, get dressed up all nice-like, put my heart on
       the line and I make a fool of myself.  Oh, boy.  Aw, I'm gonna
       start bawling here.
Marge: Oh, why don't you come inside for a drink of water?
  Moe: [voice breaking] 'K.
-- More of Moe's tender side, 

Moe sits on the couch admiring the house.

  Moe: Clean house, no silverfish.  Coulda been very happy here.
        [knock at door]
       Homer!
Homer: Moe!  What are you doing here?
  Moe: I, er, well, I -- I never touched her, Homer.  Homer, I swear I
       never touched her!
Marge: [entering] Here's your water, Moe.
  Moe: I didn't ask her for no water!  She's lying, Homer, she's lying.
       I -- she told me you were dead, that's the only reason I -- I
       didn't do nothing!  [runs out through kitchen window]
Homer: Bye Moe...
-- Moe loses his cool, 

Marge can't believe Homer's state of dishevelment.

Marge: Homer, what happened to you?
Homer: Marge, I figured out what I can give you that no one else can: a
       bouquet of po -- [sees Moe's bouquet] oh, I give up.  I don't
       deserve to live with you.
        [walks off; coffee table catches on his pants, preventing him
       from leaving]
       Oh, my tattered rags are caught on your coffee table.
Marge: Oh, here, let me help you.
        [unhooks it; she and Homer look at each others]
Homer: Wait a minute...wait, that's it!  I know now what I can offer you
       that no one else can: complete and utter dependence!
Marge: Homer, that's not a good thing.
Homer: Are you kidding?  It's a wondrous, marvelous thing!  Marge, I
       need you more than anyone else on this entire planet could
       possibly ever need you!  I need you to take care of me, to put up
       with me, and most of all I need you to love me, 'cause I love
       you.
Marge: But how do I know I can trust you?
Homer: Marge, look at me: we've been separated for a day, and I'm as
       dirty as a Frenchman.  In another few hours I'll be dead!  I
       can't afford to lose your trust again.
-- A compelling argument, 

Marge thinks about it for a few seconds, then acquiesces and hugs the
old Kwijybo.

Marge: I must admit, you really do make a gal feel needed.
Homer: Wait till my class hears about this!  [quickly] Kidding.
-- The Simpsons get back together, 

The next morning at breakfast, Homer expounds on his feelings.

Homer: [yawns] Oh, it's great to be indoors with my family.
 Lisa: I'm really glad you're back, Dad.  I knew you could do it.
       [quietly] Now don't screw it up.
 Bart: Look, Dad: I missed you so much that I couldn't concentrate in
       school and I got an F.
Homer: Hey, this is dated two weeks ago.
 Bart: Oh, sorry.  Here's a fresh one.
Marge: And I have a special present for you, but I'll give it to you
       later tonight.
Homer: Special present?  I don't want to wait!  I want it now.  I want
       the children to see.  Ooh -- oh, right.  Later.  Heh heh heh --
  Moe: [appears at kitchen window] So, Marge, are you _really_ happy?
       _Really_?
Homer: Hey Moe.
  Moe: Aah!  [ducks]
-- Easy to terrify,

 EPISODE TITLE: Bart of Darkness


EPISODE SUMMARY: 
(Thanks to Dave Hall for all his help with this part)

[Syndication cuts are marked in curly braces "{}" and are courtesy of
Ricardo Lafaurie and Frederic Briere.]

The sun, that happy Springfieldian character, beats down on the placid
town.  Hans Moleman walks out of his house, into the heat, and looks up.
"Well, you're certainly doing your job today, Mr. Sun," he observes, and
holds his glasses off his face a bit.  The sun's rays focus through the
thick lenses, burning twin holes in his shirt and setting it on fire.
"Oh, rats," he laments.

At the Springfield Wax Museum, a teenager leads a group on a tour.  "And
here we have the world-famous Beatles," his voice cracks, "exactly as
they looked performing on the Ed Sullivan show."  He motions to four
puddles of wax on a stage.  "I hardly think it's fair to be charged full
price; I'm up to my knees in the original cast of 'Mash'!"  Skinner
exclaims, literally standing in the puddles of wax that were once models
of Alan Alda, Jamie Farr, et al.

A hippie on the street plays his guitar and sings, "Sunshine on my
shoulders makes me happy," but an angry Springfield citizen punches him
in the face and walks off scowling.

Homer, however, has found a great way to beat the heat: he's opened the
refrigerator door and put a tent in front of it.  Turning the coldness
knob to "10", he tapes the tent door flaps to the freezer.  Bart and he
sit inside in their underwear with boxes of frozen food to keep their
skin cool.

 Bart: Homer, my hat goes off to you.
Homer: It's _cool_ in here, boy.  For the rest of the summer, we can
       live inside the refrigerator.
Marge: [poking her head in] Homer, the fridge wasn't meant to be used
       this way...although I must say, it's certainly refreshing!
        [She and Lisa crawl in]
        [Maggie does too, and goes to sleep on some jello]
Homer: I got the idea when I noticed the refrigerator was cold.
Marge: Won't this overload the motor?
        [the motor buzzes, then fizzles and smokes]
Homer: Marge, can you set the oven to "cold"?
-- Forgetting his Appliances 101 class, 

The family sits around glumly in the living room, trying to bear the
heat.  Marge turns on two fans, which blow her hair right, then left,
then forward.  Bart and Lisa perk up when they here the Ice Cream man
calling outside.  Peeling himself off the chair, Bart runs outside with
Lisa, and both gasp with delight when they see him approaching.

Ice Cream man: [driving past in his truck]
               I'm all out of ice cream!
                [to Bart and Lisa] It's true, you know.
               Ice cream!  Ice cream!
    Bart+Lisa: {Aw...}
    Chili man: {[driving past in his truck]
               Chili!  Red-hot Texas-style chili!  And we got gingerale:
               boiling-hot Texas-style gingerale!  Texas...}
         Bart: {Ew!}
         Lisa: Aw, face it, Bart.  Our salvation isn't just going to
               roll by on the back of some stupid truck.
                [The "Springfield Pool-Mobile" truck drives up]
                [Otto screeches to a halt, gets splashed by a wave]
         Otto: Woo, I gotta replace that window.
    Bart+Lisa: Pool Mobile?!
-- So it would seem, 

Many children frolic and play in the pool.

  Bart: [coming up for air] Look, Lis, I snatched five bathing suits --
        all Martin's!
Martin: Take your best shot!  I'm wearing seventeen layers.
         [tough kids surround him and tear at his bathing suits]
        Ha ha ha -- [gasps, notices his layers are gone]
         [quietly] I brought this on myself.
-- Learning the lesson yet again, 

All good things must come to an end, however.

Otto: OK, little dudes, time's up.  Everybody out!
       [kids groan, leave, except for Bart and Lisa]
Lisa: Time's up?
Bart: So long, Lis.  I'm going to stow away under water and go where the
      pool goes.  [hugs her] Have a good life.
       [holds his breath, submerges, but comes up again gasping]
Otto: Sorry, Bart-dude.  We gotta fill this thing with epsom salts and
      jam it on over to the old folks' home.
Bart: Oh well.  Same time tomorrow, Otto?
Otto: [laughs] No way, man.  One day of summer is all we're budgeted
      for.  I guess it is kind of a tease.
-- Curse you, financial planners!, 

Bart and Lisa get an idea.

           [Homer watches TV]
     Lisa: [walking in with Bart, blocks Homer's view of TV] Dad?
            [Homer flops sideways, continues watching TV]
     Lisa: Dad!  [turns off TV]
            [Homer turn it back on with remote control]
     Lisa: Dad!  [Bart unplugs TV]
    Homer: [cheery] Yes, Lisa?
     Lisa: Dad, as you know, we've been swimming, and we've developed a
           taste for it.  We both agree that getting our own pool is the
           only way to go.  Now before you respond, you must understand
           that your refusal would result in months and months of...
Bart+Lisa: Can we have a pool Dad?
           Can we have a pool Dad?
           Can we have a pool Dad?
           Can we have a pool Dad?
           Can we have a pool Dad?
     Bart: Can we -- [Lisa motions him to stop]
    Homer: I understand.  Let us celebrate our new arrangement with the
           adding of chocolate to milk.
-- A fitting celebration, 

The family drives off to "Pool Sharks" and are shown the various models
by the salesman.

Salesman: Over here we have the Hick Tub, the, er, Insta-Rust, that's
          the Lightning Magnet, that's the Tinkler --
   Homer: Ooh, the Tinkler!  I like the sound of that.  We'll take it!
   Marge: Is it true we should wait at least an hour after eating before
          we go in?
Salesman: Look, question, lady.  This job is not what I really do, OK?
          I play keyboards.
-- Keeping his day job, 

The family all pitch in to assemble the new pool; Bart raises planks,
Homer saws, Lisa drills, Marge welds, even Maggie brings out the
circular saw.  At the end, they admire their work.  The camera pulls
back to show the nice new aluminum barn they've built.

Homer: All right.  Everybody in the pool!
Amish: 'Tis a fine barn, but sure 'tis no pool, English.
Homer: D'oh-eth!
-- The non-Indo-European "D'oh!" variants, 

They reassemble the pool properly.

Homer: [timid] Is it a pool yet?
 Lisa: [tired] Yes, Dad.
Homer: Woo hoo!
        [the doorbell rings]
Marge: Who could that be?
        [she answers it; a huge crowd of children in bathing suits
       smiles]
Jimbo: Uh, hello, er, Mrs., uh, Bart.  Is your pool ready yet?
Marge: Mmm...
-- News travels fast, 

The house is filled with yelling children in bathing suits.  Marge,
conscientious hostess that she is, makes sandwiches for everyone, one of
which is being eaten contentedly by Lewis.

Marge: Bart, are all these children friends of yours?
 Bart: Friends and well-wishers, yes.
        [children walking by all say "Hi Bart!", "Hey Bart!" to some fat
       kid eating a sandwich]
  Boy: Hello, Mrs. Cumberdale.
-- Giving them an inch, 

Everyone frolics in the water, but Bart climbs up on top of his
treehouse to make an announcement.

    Bart: People, people!  It's time we all discussed the pool safety
          rules!
    Kids: [chanting] Jump, Bart, jump!  Jump, Bart, jump!
    Bart: You got it!
  Nelson: Hey, Bart!  Your epidermis is showing.
    Bart: [worried] It is?  [checks himself]
           [the kids laugh]
           [Bart falls, starts yelling]
  Nelson: [to Kearney] See, "epidermis" means your hair.
           [Bart lands with a thud]
          So technically it's true.  That's what makes it so funny.
          Pardon me a moment --
           [at Bart] Ha ha!
Milhouse: Hey Nelson, he's really hurt.  I think he broke his leg.
  Nelson: [exasperated] I said, "Ha ha"!
-- A quote for every occasion, 

[End of Act One.  Time: 5:40]

{Bart is rushed into the Emergency Room at the hospital.  The room is
packed with other patients, so a nurse with a cigarette orders an
orderly to get Bart a magazine.}

Hibbert: I'm sorry, that leg's going to have to come off.
          [Homer and Bart gasp]
Hibbert: [chuckles] Did I say "leg"?  I meant that wet bathing suit.
         I'm afraid you'll need a cast on that broken bone.
   Bart: Aw, I'm going to miss the whole summer.
  Homer: Don't worry, boy.  When you get a job like me, you'll miss
         every summer.
-- Yeah, but he'll also be earning money, 

Back at home, Lisa is surrounded by kids from her class.

Sherri: [to Lisa] Isn't it amazing the same day you got a pool is the
        same day we realized we liked you?
 Terri: The timing worked out great, don't you think?
-- Fair-weather friends, indeed, 

Bart sits on a chair next to the pool in his bathing suit.  Some kids
file past him, saying "Hi" uncomfortably.

    Bart: Hey, guys!  Sign my cast?  [holds out a pen] Sign my cast?
           [they all walk past] Guys!
           [they jump in the pool, laughing and playing]
          Milhouse!
Milhouse: [sneaking by] Uh...hi Bart.
    Bart: Faithful Milhouse.  You'll spend the long, hot days by my
          side, won't you?  [forces the pen into his hand]
Milhouse: [signing hurriedly] Uh, I think I lost my glasses in your
          pool.  I better go in and find them.
    Bart: But you're wearing your glasses.
Milhouse: No I'm not.  [he's signed "MilpooL", the L trailing off]
-- 

Lisa looks over at the dejected Bart and feels sorry for him.  "Maybe I
should go keep him company, at least for a little while," she thinks.
But a group of boys call to her, begging her to watch them as they hold
one boy under water and pummel him.  Lisa is torn; Bart looks at her
plaintively, then she laughs guiltily and calls "Coming!"

Bart: [thinking] Well, it looks like it's just you and me, Barty-boy.
       [aloud] Oh, great, I get to spend the summer with my brain.
-- The perils of a broken leg, 

In his room, Bart tries to rationalize his position: "What fun can you
have in a pool anyway that you can't have in a bathtub with a garbage
bag taped around your cast?"  He looks out, sees the kids playing, then
Busby Berkeley music begins as all the kids dive in in a synchronized
way.  Sixteen kids form a square in the water, then turn upside down and
wave their feet.  Lisa dives in after four similarly-dressed kids and
comes up for air in the center of a ring of kids rotating slowly in the
water.  The ring opens to let Homer lying on an inner tube in.  He takes
a swig of beer and spouts it like a whale does water from its blow hole.

Bart pulls down his blind angrily.  "Traitors!  Go on and have your
pool.  I'm fine by myself, right here."  He turns on the TV and watches
an Itchy and Scratchy cartoon, "Planet of the Aches".  Itchy barricades
Scratchy behind a brick wall for 3000 years, after which many blue mice
with large brains and white robes release him.  Scratchy is old and grey
and trembles when they approach, but they pet him and lead him to a
bath.  Their brains pulse, and brushes come in and groom the wizened
cat; a white robe descends and clothes him.  Sighing, Scratchy is led
into an arena full of mice by his three liberators.  They look at him
expectantly, and he begins to sweat.  The audience closes its eyes, and
their brains pulse, bringing forth many sharp objects which slice and
dice the hapless cat.  They applaud approvingly.

  Bart: [laughing at I&amp;S] You know, this isn't so bad.  I'll just spend
        the summer getting better acquainted with an old friend called
        television.
         [kids cheer, Krusty appears and laughs]
Krusty: Hope you enjoyed that, kids, 'cause Krusty's out of here for the
        summer.  In the meantime, we'll be running [groans] "Klassic
        Krusty".  [laughs uncomfortably] Enjoy...
         [the Krusty Show from February 6th, 1961 comes on]
Krusty: [chuckles] Good evening.  Tonight my guest is AFL/CIO chairman
        George Meany, who will be discussing collective bargaining
        agreements.
 Meany: It's a pleasure to be here, Krusty.
Krusty: Let me be blunt: is there a labor crisis in America today?
        [looks bored]
 Meany: Well that depends what you mean by "crisis"...
         [Bart groans]
-- Not as classic as Krusty with Noam Chomsky, 

Homer gets up at sunrise and sighs.

Homer: Ah, there's nothing like rising with the sun for a quiet,
       peaceful dip in your very own pool.
        [cheers, dives in]
        [comes up covered in algae, yells and sputters]
        [Lisa walks out] Lisa, the Blob has got me!  Don't touch me or
       he'll get you too.
 Lisa: Dad, you have to put chlorine in the water every day to keep it
       clean.
Homer: Chlorine, eh?
        [later, all the kids scream and rub their bloodshot eyes]
Ralph: [coming up] Ow, my face is on fire!
-- Big surprise there, 

Marge grumbles, then looks up at Bart's room.

     Marge: Oh look, there's Bart!  Wave to him!  [she and Lisa do]
             [Bart pulls his blinds down]
            Mmm, maybe we should spend more time with Bart.  He's
            becoming isolated and weird...
             [in Bart's room, Bart plays Stratego and holds one red
            piece and one blue piece, and does the voices for each]
Blue piece: I swear I don't know where the bombs are.  Only the miners
            know that.
 Red piece: Maybe this will loosen your tongue...hah!
Blue piece: No!  Aah!
-- A tenuous grip on reality, 

Lisa walks in.

Lisa: Uh, Bart --
Bart: [pointing] Don't turn on that light!
Lisa: Sorry, I just came to see how you were feeling.
Bart: I'm fine, just fine.
Lisa: What are you writing here?  A play?
Bart: Er...no.
Lisa: Y'uh huh, [reads] cast of characters: Viceroy Fizzlebottom, a
      hearty cherub of a man --
Bart: [grabs it] Gimme that, it's a work in progress!
-- The sensitive playwright, 

Bart: So...how do you like being Miss Popularity?
Lisa: Oh, well, you know, it ain't so great.
       [Bart looks at her]
      Bart, it's the best thing that ever happened to me in my whole
      life!  [forced laugh] Well, anyway, I brought you a present.  It's
      a telescope I won at the optics festival.
Bart: There was an optics festival and I wasn't informed?
-- Apparently not, 

Bart dismisses her and picks up a Mad Magazine with Alfred E. Neuman
dressed in a police uniform and the title "NYPD Blecch".  "What have we
here?  'The Lighter Side of Hippies'," he reads, then laughs strangely.
"They don't care whose toes they step on!" he laughs strangely again.

Outside, Marge laughs raucously while Homer chuckles seductively, their
garments draped over the outside of the pool.

 Marge: This was a lovely idea, Homey.  Come here and kiss me...
 Homer: Mmm...[shudders]
         [a light shines down on them, and they cover themselves and
        scream]
Wiggum: [from a helicopter, through a megaphone] Do not be alarmed,
        continue swimming naked.  [eats popcorn] Aw, c'mon, continue!
        Come on!  Oh...
         [to Lou] All right, Lou, open fire.
-- Misdemeanors in Springfield only, 

Bart checks out space with his telescope, many wondrous sights passing
before his eyes.

 Bart: Wow, the universe is so boring.  I know!  I'll use this to peer
       into Springfield's seamy underbelly.
        [scans school, sees Skinner sharpening pencils, groans]
        [scans Dr. Hibbert riding his bike and watching TV, groans]
        [scans Jimmy Stewart in a wheelchair with a camera and a large
       telephoto lens]
Jimmy: Grace, c'mere!  There's a sinister-looking kid I want you to see.
-- A rear window into Springfield, 

  Bart: Oh, I'm never _ever_ going to see anything interesting with this
        stupid piece of junk.  [disassembles telescope, puts it away]
         [a woman screams]
        That came from Flanders' house!
         [starts reassembling the telescope, then gives up]
         [woman screams again]
         [Bart hastily assembles the telescope, spies Flanders looking
        at the floor]
   Ned: Oh my God, what have I done?  I've killed her!  [pulls blind]
  Bart: This can't be what it looks like: this is Flanders we're talking
        about!  Nah, I'll just watch some TV.  [turns it on]
Krusty: And now, what you've been waitin' for, another long raga by Ravi
        Shanker.
  Ravi: Shankar.
Krusty: Shankar.  Groovy, man.
-- 

Bart falls asleep, but awakens to a digging sound.  Curious, he looks
through the telescope and sees Flanders filling dirt into a grave.

      [Flanders fills in a grave]
Bart: Oh, this can't be what it looks like!  There's gotta be some other
      explanation!
 Ned: I wish there was some other explanation for this, but there isn't.
      I'm a murderer.  I'm a murderer!
Bart: Then that's not the real Ned Flanders.
 Ned: [yelling] I'm a mur-diddley-urdler.
Bart: If that's not Flanders, he's done his homework.
-- Understudying for Ned, 

[End of Act Two.  Time: 14:00]

Bart watches through the telescope as Rod and Todd walk up to their
Daddy.

    Todd: Daddy, where's Mommy?  We miss her.
     Ned: Mommy...had to go away.  She's with God now.
Rod+Todd: Yay!  Can we go there too?
     Ned: [remorsefully] Soon enough.
Rod+Todd: Yay!
    Bart: [gasps] He's going to kill Rod and Todd too.  That's horrible!
          ...in principle.
-- Bart vs. the seventh commandment, 

Lisa lies in the pool on a floating chair with her sunglasses on while
the other kids try to impress her.

Nelson: Look, Lisa: I found this change on the bottom of the pool.  You
        can have it.
  Lisa: Thanks, Nelson.
 Ralph: [coming up for air] Somebody took my juice money!
   Rex: Lisa, please join my family for a weekend in the country.
        They'll be hunting, charades, and ever so many delightful
        romantic misunderstandings?
         [kids clamor for her]
  Lisa: [thinking] They're only using you for your pool, you know.
         [aloud] Shut up, brain!  I got friends now.  I don't need you
        any more.
         [moronically] Duh, yeah, I'd love to go to your house, hyuck
        hyuck.
-- Nope, no need for thinking, 

Martin Prince has had a brainwave, despite the heat wave.  He's cajoled
his parents into building him his very own pool.  Two workmen fill it.

Martin: Ah, my plan has come to fruition.  Soon _I'll_ be queen of
        summertime.  Er, king.  King!
         [workmen look at each other]
-- Filling Martin's new pool, 

Back at the Simpson pool...

              [Dolph whispers to Jimbo]
       Jimbo: [to Kearney] Dude, Buzz has it an even wussier kid has an
              even better pool than this!
               [pool empties of kids; water level sinks dramatically]
        Lisa: Huh?  Hello?  Hey, I'm stuck in here!
              I gotta think of a way to get out.
Lisa's brain: Well, well, well: look who's come crawling back.
-- No easy escape from one's brain, 

Bart pleads with his family to believe him about Ned.

  Bart: Listen, Ned Flanders murdered his wife!
 Homer: But why?  She's such a fox.
         [Marge scowls at him]
        I mean, what's on Fox tonight?  Something ribald ["rye-bald"],
        no doubt.
 Marge: Mmm, I wish you'd stop spreading bad rumors about people.
        Remember how you got Grampa tarred and feathered?
  Bart: Sure, that was twenty minutes ago.
Grampa: Gonna be in the tub for a while.
-- That, you are, 

Lisa apologizes to Bart for her behavior.

Lisa: Bart, I'm really sorry I've been ignoring you lately.  I got
      carried away with being popular.  But, now that I'm unpopular
      again, I want you to know I'm here for you.
Bart: You can start making it up to me right now.  Flanders is leaving
      the house.  I want you to sneak in there and bring me back some
      evidence.  And something sweet for later.
Lisa: Bart, I'm here for you, but I'm not going to break into somebody's
      house.
Bart: All right, you're right, you're right, let's, let's just forget
      about that.  Here: let me read to you from my play.  Ahem.
       [cockney] "`Kippers for breakfast, Aunt Helga?  Is it St.
      Swithin's Day already?'
      `'Tis,' replied Aunt Helga" --
Lisa: I'm going, I'm going!
-- Incentive enough for anyone, 

Bart follows her progress as she walks in through Flanders' sliding
patio doors.  She opens the fridge and pulls out a sphere labeled "Human
Head".  Bart gasps, but when Lisa brushes off the condensation, it reads
"Schuman Farms Head of Lettuce".  "Phew!  Oh, of course."

But Flanders drives into his driveway and Bart panics, pleading with
Lisa to leave.  Instead she climbs the stairs, but Bart warns her she'll
be trapped.  He sees Ned looking angry, walking with an ax.

 Bart: [watching Flanders] An ax.  He's got an ax!  I'll save you, Lisa!
        [tries to walk on his leg, falls back] Uh, I'll save you by
       calling the police.  [dials 911]
Voice: Hello, and welcome to the Springfield Police Department Resc-u-
       Fone[tm].  If you know the name of the felony being committed,
       press one.  To choose from a list of felonies, press two.  If you
       are being murdered or calling from a rotary phone, please stay on
       the line.
 Bart: [growls, punches some numbers]
Voice: You have selected regicide.  If you know the name of the king or
       queen being murdered, press one.
-- Shockingly ineffective answering services, 

Bart goes back to the telescope and sees Flanders closing in on Lisa.
He vows, "I'll save you, cast or no cast!" and steps into his garbage
can.  It sticks to his foot.  "Gotta save Lisa, trash can or no trash
can," he intones, walking precariously down the stairs.  Outside, he
steps on a hose, which sticks to the trash can, and goes "D'oh!"  A
giant piece of sod sticks inside the hose, but Bart continues on
inexorably.  Jimmy Stewart watches the whole thing and frets, "Oh no!
That sinister-looking kid is coming to kill me.  Help.  Help!  Aah!"

Flanders' shadow ascends the stairs singing "Mary Had a Little Lamb"
softly, the ax plainly silhouetted, and Lisa gasps in fright.  She looks
both ways down the hall, seeing no escape, then spies a way into the
attic.  Frantically she jumps for the cord that brings the stairs down,
catching it just in time and running up them.  Slamming them behind her,
she hides behind a trunk behind a bird cage and waits, shaking.

Flanders, too, pulls the cord and climbs into the attic.  Bart stumbles
through the front door, dragging a tricycle and a dog as well now.
Flanders pants, "It's time to put you away," and raises the ax
menacingly.  "Put you away...for good!" he says ominously, and Lisa
screams, as does Bart.  But Flanders merely places the ax back in its
holder.

  Ned: Ho!  What the gumdrops is going on here?
 Bart: Came to stop you from murdering Lisa like you murdered your wife!
  Ned: Murdered?  [groans, faints]
        [later]
Maude: Murdered?  Oh no, I've just been in the country for a week.
 Bart: [to Flanders] But I distinctly heard you say that Maude was with
       God.
Maude: Oh, that's right.  I was at Bible Camp.  I was learning how to be
       more judgemental.
-- A useful Christian skill, 

 Bart: But I saw the murder and then I saw you bury the corpse in the
       back yard!
  Ned: [weeping] All right, it's true.  I am a murderer!
        [everyone gasps]
       I overwatered Maude's favorite ficus plant, I panicked, then I
       buried the remains.  I was hoping to replace it before you got
       home.
 Bart: But I heard a woman scream.
  Ned: Oh?  Well, now that I can't explain.
  Lou: [holding up plant] Found it, Chief.
  Ned: [screams like a woman]
 Bart: Oh.  Well, I guess that explains everything.
Homer: Not everything.  There's still the little matter of the
       whereabouts of your wife.
Maude: Um, I'm right here.
Homer: [sarcastic] Oh, I see.  Then everything is wrapped up in a neat
       little package.
        [everyone looks at him]
       Really, I mean that.  Sorry if it sounded sarcastic.
-- Getting his histrionics wrong, 

Martin's pool is even fuller with kids than the Simpsons' was.

Martin: More friends!  More allies!  More, I say.  Hang those who talk
        of less.  There's a few inches over here, ho!
         [one more kid squeezes in, causing the pool to burst]
        My precious pool and its lifestyle accoutrements...no!
         [everyone grumbles, leaves]
Nelson: [rips off Martin's bathing suit] Ha ha!
Martin: Oh.  The gentle caress of the summer breeze.  [sings]
        The summer wind
        Came blowing in
        From across the sea...
-- Martin Frank Prince, I presume?, 

[End of Act Three.  Time: 21:24]

The music to Frank Sinatra's "Summer Wind" continues over the credits.

 EPISODE TITLE: Lisa's Rival


EPISODE SUMMARY: 
[Syndication cuts are marked in curly braces "{}" and are courtesy of
Frederic Briere and Ricardo Lafaurie.]

Lisa practices scales on her saxophone in her room when Bart enters.

   Bart: Lisa, will you keep it down?  I'm making a crank phone call to
         Principal Skinner.
Skinner: [on phone] Well, as a matter of fact, my refrigerator _wasn't_
         running.  You've spared me quite a bit of spoilage: thank you,
         anonymous young man.
   Bart: D'oh!
   Lisa: It's my room, and I can do what I want.
   Bart: Oh yeah?  Well I can do what I want in _my_ room.
          [walks off into his room, starts kicking wall]
   Lisa: Bart, quit it!
   Bart: [reading "Bad Boy's Life"] I can keep this up _all day_.
-- A man of his word, 

Lisa heads to the garage to play in peace, but Homer is already there.

Homer: Lisa, stop the racket.  I'm trying to fix your mother's camera.
        [holds drill to it, with hammer poised above it]
       Now, easy...easy...[hits it; it smashes]
       Hmm...I'm going to need a bigger drill.
-- The Time-Life series on camera repair, 

Inside the house, Maggie colors with some magic markers while Marge
reads a romance novel.  She begins daydreaming about being on a ship
with a tanned, muscular fellow.

 Marge: My, these seas are certainly heaving.
Pirate: Well, no more than your bountiful bosom, [sly] milady.
 Marge: [laughs rakishly] Does that earring mean you're a pirate?
         [refers to earring in pirate's right ear]
Pirate: Kinda.  Ah, the seas have quieted.  And only in the sweet
        embrace of quietude can two lovers truly be --
         [Lisa starts playing her sax]
        Ooh, such noise!  Well, _I'm_ done for the evening.
         [Marge comes back to reality]
 Marge: Mmm!  Lisa, stop blowing my sex.  I mean, stop blowing your sax,
        your sax.  Stop it.
  Lisa: Mom, I'm auditioning for first chair in the school band and I've
        got to practice!
 Marge: I'm sorry, but I sacrificed a very expensive camera just to get
        some quiet time.
-- The price she pays, 

Even Maggie can't stand the noise: she plugs her ears with pacifiers.
"Fine, I'll play outside," Lisa says sullenly.

          {[the sound of Lisa's saxophone can be heard outside]}
Flanders: {Hey, what -- that sounds like Gabriel's trumpet.  You know
          what that means, kids!}
Rod+Todd: {Yay!  Judgment Day!}
-- Trumpet, saxophone: whatever, 

In Miss Hoover's class, the children are writing a quiz.

Hoover: Forty-five seconds till pencils down.
 Ralph: [whispering] Lisa, what's the answer to number seven?
  Lisa: [whispering] Sorry, Ralph.  That would defeat the purpose of
        testing as a means of student evaluation.
 Ralph: [pause] My cat's name is Mittens.
-- Followups set to alt.non.sequitur, 

Miss Hoover counts down the last three seconds until pencils down as the
students groan.

Hoover: Now, here's an oral extra-credit question.  What was Christopher
        Columbus actually looking for when he discovered America?
  Lisa: [puts her hand up] Ooh!  Ooh!
Hoover: Anyone besides Lisa for a change?
 Ralph: [puts his hand up] Ooh!  Ah!
Hoover: [nonplussed] Ralph, this better not be about your cat.
 Ralph: [puts his hand down] Oh.
Hoover: Oh, all right, Lis --
Alison: Columbus was looking for a passage to India.
Hoover: Correct, Alison!  And on your very first day in our class.
Alison: And, during a subsequent voyage, Columbus found what is now the
        continent of South America.
Hoover: Yowie...
  Lisa: I never made Miss Hoover "yowie"...
-- The grade two appraisal system, 

At lunch time, Lisa approaches Alison, who is seated on a bench eating a
sandwich.

  Lisa: Hi, Alison, I'm Lisa Simpson.  Oh, it's great to finally meet
        someone who converses above the normal eight-year-old level.
Alison: Actually, I'm seven.  I was just skipped ahead because I was
        getting bored with the first grade.
  Lisa: You're younger than me too?
         [look worried, starts breathing into her paper lunch bag]
Alison: Are you hyperventilating?
  Lisa: No...I just like to smell my lunch.
-- No snouts and entrails there, 

  Lisa: Gee, I never met anyone who's skipped a grade before.
Alison: I'm surprised you haven't been skipped.  You're obviously smart
        enough.
  Lisa: Well, I'm sure I could have, but, heh, I'd hate to leave behind
        my wonderful friends.
 Sarah: [walking up] Out of the way, brain queen!
         [pushes Lisa over]
  Lisa: [chuckling sheepishly] Hey Sarah.
-- Not exactly debating team material, 

  Lisa: Well, I gotta go.  I have to practice for band auditions.
Alison: Me too!  Hey, what instrument do you play?
  Lisa: The sax.
Alison: Me too!
  Lisa: I'm going for first chair this year.
Alison: Me too!
  Lisa: Wow!  [disingenuous] We have so much in common, I'm sure we'll
        be the best of friends...
Alison: Me too.
  Lisa: [weakly] Me too...
-- Ralph's cat would say "Me three", 

In the car, Homer eats a slice of pizza with both hands while Bart
steers.

 Bart: Hurry up and finish eating!
Homer: You're steering fine, boy.  Hard to the right!
 Bart: Oh!
Homer: Hard to the left!
 Bart: Oh!
Homer: Cat!  Deer!  Old man!
  Abe: [diving out of the way] Aah!
Homer: Jackknifed sugar truck!  [gasps] Sugar?
        [skids to halt; Hans Moleman stands outside the truck]
Homer: Don't worry, buddy.  Here's a quarter; call for help at the
       nearest phone.  I'll keep an eye on things here.
 Hans: If only this sugar were as sweet as you, sir.  [walks off]
 Bart: Homer, that was downright decent of you.
Homer: We've hit the jackpot here!  White gold, Texas tea!  ...
       sweetener.
-- Something like that, anyway, 

Homer shovels sugar into the trunk.

 Bart: Dad, isn't this stealing?
Homer: Read your town charter, boy.  "If foodstuff should touch the
       ground, said foodstuff shall be turned over to the village
       idiot."  Since I don't see him around...start shoveling!
-- He's with the comely lasses of virtue true, 

Homer fills the car all the way up, which gives Bart trouble breathing.

Back at home, Marge continues her pirate daydream.

Marge: [sighs dreamily]
 Lisa: Mom?
Marge: What?  What?
 Lisa: Why am I still rotting away in the second grade instead of being
       skipped ahead?
Marge: I dunno honey, I guess that's the school's decision to make.
 Lisa: Well, did you ever talk to anyone at the school?  Make a few
       calls on my behalf?  Maybe you could have been "nicer" to
       Principal Skinner, if ya know what I mean.
Marge: Lisa!  ...I _am_ nice.
-- Marge avoids the question, 

At the dinner table that night...

Marge: Homer, I really appreciate you making dinner, but this food
       tastes a little strange.
 Lisa: It hurts my teeth.
Homer: That's because I've loaded it with sugar!
        [holds up bag containing "Farmer Homer's Sweet Sweet Sugar"]
       Marge, our ship has come in!  I found five hundred pounds of
       sugar [to Bart, sly] in the forest [to Marge] that I'm going to
       sell directly to the consumer!  All for a low, low price of one
       dollar per pound.
Marge: But the grocery store sells sugar for thirty-five cents a pound.
 Lisa: And it doesn't have nails and broken glass in it.
Homer: Those are prizes!  [eats a mouthful] Ooh, a blasting cap.
-- Don't bite down too hard, now, 

The day of the school band auditions arrives.  Uter, the foreign
exchange student, plays his mountain horn.

 Largo: It's your turn, Jimbo.
 Jimbo: [steps up with tambourine, hits it once] Unh!
 Largo: Hmm, someone's been practicing over the summer.  Welcome aboard.
 Jimbo: Yes!  [walks off, hits Martin in the head with tambourine]
Martin: Ow!  My lute!  [he drops it, breaking it]
 Largo: [not caring] Mm hm.
-- Sympathy for the lute, 

Mr. Largo calls Lisa up to audition for first chair, saxophone.  Lisa
plays a little ditty, tapping her foot to the beat.  "Mmm, very nice.
Now, Alison Taylor, also trying for first chair saxophone," calls Mr.
Largo.  Alison Steps up and plays something slightly more difficult-
sounding.  "Oh, this is a _very_ tough decision, girls," Mr. Largo
grins, "You're both very good."

Alison ups the ante and plays some more up-beat jazz, to which the
assembled audience of children claps.  "Well," chuckles Mr. Largo, "I
guess that clinches that -- " but Lisa responds in kind with her own up-
beat improvisation.  The children applaud her, too.

It turns into "Duelling Saxophones," with Lisa and Alison playing over
each other trying to outdo each other as the children get up and dance.
They both hold a long loud note and start turning red; Lisa loses her
breath and passes out, falling off the stage.

 Lisa: [opening her eyes]
Largo: Oh!  That was a close one, Lisa, but you made it.
 Lisa: [happy] I won first chair?
Largo: No, you regained consciousness.  Alison got first chair.
 Lisa: [screams, passes out again]
        [opens her eyes]
       Oh, it was just a dream...
Largo: Oh!  That was a close one, Lisa, but you made it.
 Lisa: [happy] I won first chair?
Largo: No, you regained consciousness.  Alison got first chair -- and
       believe me, this is _not_ a dream!
 Lisa: [screams]
-- Largo's people skills, 

[End of Act One.  Time: 7:25]

Marge dries the dishes in the kitchen.  Lisa enters.

 Lisa: I need help, Mom.  There's another girl at school who's smarter,
       younger, and a better sax player than me.  Ew, I feel so average.
Marge: Well, you'll always be number one to me --
 Bart: [walking past] Ahem, hello...first born within earshot.
Marge: Mmm, I meant my number-one girl --
        [Maggie tugs on Marge's dress]
       Oh, for cry -- mmm.  Honey, if you get too competitive, you'll
       never be happy.  No matter how good you are, there's always going
       to be someone better than you.  {I always thought I had the
       tallest hair, but that trip to Graceland really opened my eyes.}
 Lisa: But she's better than me at everything that makes me special!
Marge: Oh, believe me honey, she's more scared of you than you are of
       her.
 Lisa: [sullen] You're thinking of bears, Mom.
-- 

{Homer goes door-to-door trying to sell his sugar.}

  Homer: {[ringing doorbell] Sugar man!  [eats some from the bag]}
Skinner: {Door-to-door sugar?  [chuckles] What a marvelous idea.
          [Skinner's mother calls] What's that mother?  ...I'm just
         talking to the sugar man!  ...Mother, I'm a big boy, I can do
         as I wish!
          [to Homer] Excuse me.  [slams door]
          [opens door] Thanks a lot, Simpson, now I'm grounded!}
-- Perils of living with your parents, 

There's another quiz in Miss Hoover's class.

 Ralph: [whispers] Hey, Alison: what's the answer to number nine?
Alison: [whispers] I can't tell you, Ralph.
  Lisa: [whispers] I can't tell you either, Ralph.
 Ralph: [to Lisa] Leave me alone!
-- Snubbed by Ralph of all people, 

Three of the bigger girls push Alison around at recess, calling her
brainiac, nerd, and geekazoid.  When they push her in the mud, Lisa
recalls how it used to be _her_ that got pushed around.

    Bart: I can't stand to see you so miserable, Lis...unless it's from
          a rubber spider down your dress.  Hmm, that gives me an idea.
           [pulls out pocket tape recorder, presses "record"]
          Note for later: put rubber spider down Lisa's dress.
          [chuckles]
           [turns back to Lisa, then as an afterthought, chuckles onto
          tape again]
          Hey, I know!  How about I dig up some dirt on Alison?
          Remember how I got Milhouse's picture on "America's Most
          Wanted"?
           [two agents in sunglasses drive up, see Milhouse]
 Agent 1: There he is on the monkey bars.
 Agent 2: Try to take him alive.
Milhouse: Oh no, not again!
-- Bart's bestest buddy, 

Lisa declines Bart's offer as the agents crash through the fence and the
monkey bars and chase after the hapless Milhouse.

Lisa: I appreciate the offer, but it goes against every moral fiber in
      my body.
Bart: Suit yourself.  If you change your mind, here's my card.
Lisa: I don't need a card.  You live in the room next to me.
Bart: [into tape recorder] Note: next year, order fewer cards.
-- Dirt-finding business practice, 

Homer describes his sugar-selling success to Marge.

Homer: And you didn't think I'd make any money.  I found a dollar while
       I was waiting for the bus.
Marge: While you were out "earning" that dollar, you lost forty dollars
       by not going to work.  The plant called and said if you don't
       come in tomorrow, don't bother coming in Monday.
Homer: Woo hoo!  A four-day weekend.
-- That should be five, surely?, 

Lisa sits in her room and contemplates the trophies on her bookshelf.

     Lisa: Hey, I _am_ above average!  So what if Alison's ahead of me?
           There's no shame in being second.
            [imagines]
Announcer: And now, Avis Rent-A-Car is proud to present the second best
           band in America.  Will you welcome Garfunkel, Messina, Oates,
           and Lisa singing their number two hit, "Born to Runner-up".
            [Audience boos]
     Lisa: Why would they come to our concert just to boo us?
-- Because you're number two?, 

Bart walks in with a sheet of paper.

    Bart: Lis, I did some checking on this Alison character, and I know
          it's against all your moral fibers --
    Lisa: [grabs sheet] Give it to me.  [chuckles] Hey, wait!  There's
          nothing bad here.
    Bart: Yep, she's clean as a bean, but...I _did_ tip off the Feds as
          to the whereabouts of our good friend Milhouse.
           [Milhouse stands at the mouth of a large pipe with his hands
          up, facing an agent pointing a gun at him]
Milhouse: I'm telling you, I didn't do anything.
   Agent: I don't care.
Milhouse: [turns around, looks down, jumps...off a dam]
          Aah...[hits churning water at bottom] Ouch!  My glasses.
-- Priorities out of whack, 

Lisa, meanwhile, crumples the paper compiled by Bart.

Lisa: [sigh] I've got to stop being so petty.  I should be Alison's
      friend, not her competitor.  I mean...she is a wonderful person...
Bart: Way to go, Lis.  I mean, why compete with someone who's just going
      to kick your butt anyway?
Lisa: [pause] I prefer my phrasing.
-- 

Lisa confronts her demons and goes over to Alison's house.

Alison: It's great of you to come over, Lisa.  I really want us to be
        friends.
  Lisa: You're a wonderful person.
Taylor: Hi, Lisa, I'm Alison's father, Professor Taylor.  I've heard
        great things about you.
  Lisa: Oh, really?  I --
Taylor: Oh, don't be modest.  I'm glad we have someone who can join us
        in our anagram game.
Alison: We take proper names and rearrange the letters to form a
        description of that person.
Taylor: Like, er...oh, I don't know, uh...Alec Guinness.
Alison: [thinks] Genuine class.
Taylor: Ho ho, very good.  All right, Lisa, um...Jeremy Irons.
  Lisa: [looks with consternation] Jeremy's...iron.
Taylor: Mm hmm, well that's...very good...for a first try.  You know
        what?  I have a ball.  [pulls one from his pocket] Perhaps you'd
        like to bounce it?
-- Lowering the level of difficulty, 

The girls walk into Alison's room -- which is plastered with trophies
and awards.  One trophy gleams so brightly, Lisa has to turn her head
away and squint at it.  She walks over to Alison's desk and notices a
cardboard model.

  Lisa: What's this?
Alison: Oh, it's for the school diorama competition.
  Lisa: You're finished _already_?  But the competition isn't for weeks!
Alison: [smirks] Lisa, we're talking dioramas.  Who could wait?
-- The fascination of dioramas, 

Alison explains her project.

Alison: I chose "The Tell-Tale Heart" by Edgar Allen Poe.  See, this is
        the bedroom where the old man was murdered...and he's buried
        here under the floorboards.  Oh, and look, I used an old
        metronome to simulate the heartbeat that drove the killer
        _insane_.
         [flicks a switch; the metronome ticks slowly]
        Ha ha, it's neat, huh?
  Lisa: [uncomfortable] Ha ha, it's great, it's really great.
         [she pulls out the ball, tries to bounce it, and drops it]
Taylor: Oh!  Got away from you, huh?  Well, you keep at it.
-- Murphy's Law with a vengeance, 

[End of Act Two.  Time: 13:02]

The sun rises over Springfield as Homer sits outside with a club in
front of a mound of sugar.

Homer: [sleepy] Must...protect...sugar.  Thieves everywhere.  The strong
       must protect the sweet...the sweet...[snores]
Marge: [walking out] Homer?
Homer: [with a Spanish accent] In America, first you get the sugar, then
       you get the power, then you get the women...[snores]
Marge: Homer...Homer!
Homer: Wha...what?
Marge: I want you to forget about guarding the stupid sugar!  You're
       being completely paranoid.
Homer: Oh, am I?  Am I really?  Ah ha!
        [Pulls a man from behind the pile]
Thief: [holds teacup and saucer] Hello.
Homer: All right, pal: where'd you get the sugar for that tea?
Thief: I nicked it when you let your guard down for that split second,
       and I'd do it again.  [sips tea] Goodbye.
-- Homer Pacino defends his territory, 

Homer pleads his case with Marge.

Homer: You see, Marge?  Do you see?
Marge: Homer, when are you going to give up this crazy sugar scheme?
Homer: Never, Marge!  Never.  I can't live the button-down life like
       you.  I want it all: the terrifying lows, the dizzying highs, the
       creamy middles.  Sure, I might offend a few of the bluenoses with
       my cocky stride and musky odors -- oh, I'll never be the darling
       of the so-called "City Fathers" who cluck their tongues, stroke
       their beards, and talk about "What's to be done with this Homer
       Simpson?"
Marge: Look, just get rid of the sugar, OK?
Homer: No!  [Marge leaves]
        [a swarm of bees lands on Homer and the sugar pile]
       Aah!  Hey, get off my sugar.  Bad bees!  Bad!  [gets stung]
       Ow.  Oww!  Oh, they're defending themselves somehow.
-- Yeah, they'll do that, 

Bart walks into Lisa's room to see what she's doing.

     Lisa: Look, Bart.  It almost killed me, but I handcrafted all 75
           characters from Oliver Twist.  And now, the coup de grace: a
           bitter snowstorm.
            [turn on fan, sprinkles confetti]
Bart+Lisa: Ooh!
            [the diorama lifts up, then blows out the window]
     Bart: Uh oh.  [crash]
     Lisa: [with trepidation] Is it OK?
     Bart: Well...the important thing is, _we_ survived.
-- Small mercies, 

Lisa: Oh, who am I kidding?  There's no _way_ I'm ever going to beat
      Alison.
Bart: Sure there is!  ...but it involves being a bit underhanded, a bit
      devious, a bit -- as the French say -- Bartesque.
Lisa: I'll do whatever it takes.
Bart: Then welcome to the nether regions of the soul.
-- No hyperbole in this household, 

Bart closes Lisa's venetian blind and grabs a piece of paper and a
pencil.

Bart: Now, here's what we do.  Tomorrow morning when Alison comes out of
      her house, we spray her with the hose -- soaking her from head to
      toe, leaving us relatively dry.
Lisa: "Relatively"?
Bart: Well, there's bound to be some splash-back.
Lisa: Bart, her being wet won't help me win the competition.
Bart: Well...we could just sabotage her diorama, humiliating her in
      front of the students and faculty.
Lisa: Perfect!
Bart: Leaving her primed for the most dramatic hose-soaking of her life!
Lisa: Enough with the hose!
-- A one-track mind, 

At Goldsboro's Honey, two beekeepers discuss the day.

Beekeeper 1: Well, sure is quiet in here today.
Beekeeper 2: Yes, a little too quiet, if you know what I mean.
Beekeeper 1: Hmm...I'm afraid I don't.
Beekeeper 2: You see, bees usually make a lot of noise.  No noise --
             suggests no bees!
Beekeeper 1: Oh, I understand now.  Oh look, there goes one now.
Beekeeper 2: To the Beemobile!
Beekeeper 1: You mean your Chevy?
Beekeeper 2: Yes.
-- Again with the West/Ward jokes!, 

The beekeepers track their bees down to Homer's sugar pile.

Beekeeper 1: Well, very clever, Simpson, luring our bees to your sugar
             pile and selling them back to us at an inflated price.
      Homer: Bees are on the what now?
Beekeeper 2: Simpson, you diabolical...we're willing to pay you $2000
             for the swarm.  [starts counting money]
      Homer: Deal!
              [thunder crashes, rain starts]
Beekeeper 1: Oh, wait a minute.  The bees are leaving.
      Homer: No!  My sugar is melting.  Melting!  Oh, what a world.
              [thief spits out his tea]
      Homer: [weeps] My sugar's gone...
      Marge: [walk out with umbrella] I'm sorry, Homey.
      Homer: It's OK, Marge.  I've learned my lesson.  A mountain of
             sugar is too much for one man.  It's clear now why God
             portions it out in those tiny packets, and why he lives on
             a plantation in Hawaii.
-- And Homer should know, too, 

It's the big diorama contest day at Springfield Elementary.

Skinner: Ah, "Diorama-Rama", my favorite school event next to "Hearing-
         Test Thursday".
          [he and Miss Hoover walk up to Nelson's diorama]
 Hoover: "The Grapes of Wrath"?  I don't get it.
 Nelson: Here's the grapes...and here's the wrath!
          [pounds grapes with a mallet, soaking Skinner and Miss Hoover]
          [all the kids groan]
Skinner: [dismissive] Yes, yes, very good wrath.
-- Remarkable control of his temper, 

Skinner: Ah, let's see: our foreign exchange student Uter has chosen
         "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory".  I -- but this is just an
         empty box!
   Uter: [chocolate on his face and hands] I begged you to look at mine
         first...I begged you!
-- An eight-fold double-corrugated fourteen-gauge box, no less, "Lisa's
    Rival"

Bart walks in with a box covered by a sheet.

    Bart: Lisa, here is -- as the French say -- le fake diorama.  I'll
          create a diversion and you make the switch.
           [walks to center of gym]
          Hey everybody, whoa!  Look at me, I'm over here.  Turn this
          way right now!
  Sherri: Hey, it's Bart!
Milhouse: And he's doin' stuff!
           [everyone turns to look, fascinated]
           [Lisa grabs Alison's diorama, leaves the other one there, and
          hides Alison's in a trap door in the gym floor]
 Skinner: Bart, stop creating a diversion and get out of here!
           [Bart caws like a crow and leaves]
-- Quoth the raven, indeed, 

Lisa and Bart give each other the thumbs-up.

  Hoover: OK, our next entry is "The Tell-Tale Heart" by Alison Taylor.
 Skinner: Mmm, I can't wait to see this.  [low voice] Be ready with the
          ribbon.
           [pulls cover off to reveal bloody animal heart]
Children: Ew!
  Hoover: What _is_ it?
    Bart: [disguising his voice] It's a cow's heart.  [changing voices]
          They're trying to make a monkey out of you.  [Lisa smiles]
 Skinner: Alison, is this supposed to be some kind of joke?
  Alison: I didn't do that...I made a different one.
 Skinner: Oh, is that so, young lady?  Where is this "phantom diorama"?
  Alison: Uh, I don't know...
           [Lisa hears a heart beating, and looks worried]
 Skinner: Aw, at least have the guts to take the blame, girl.  You're
          only compounding your folly by lying about it.
    Bart: Right on!
 Skinner: Young lady, cow hearts belong in a butcher's window, not the
          classroom.
           [Lisa hears the heart getting louder, frets]
          Well, maybe in an older students' biology classroom, but
          that's none of my business.  Elementary school is where I
          wound up, and it's too late to do anything about that!
-- Losing track of the point, 

Skinner confesses he's starting to regret having skipped Alison ahead,
and she sobs.  Meanwhile, the heartbeat is getting louder in Lisa's
ears.  She looks down to see the trap door beating too.  Alison sobs a
bit more, then Lisa loses it and screams.

   Lisa: Aah!  It's the beating of that hideous heart!
          [everyone looks at her]
         I mean, I think I hear something.
          [opens trap door, retrieves diorama]
         Why, here's Alison's real diorama.  It got misplaced...[laughs
         a bit] or so it would seem.
Skinner: Oh, well, that changes everything.  Let's have a look.
         [quietly to Miss Hoover] Get the ribbon ready.
          [pulls sheet off]
         Oh...a little...sterile...no _real_ insight.  What do you
         think, Miss Hoover?
 Hoover: Ehh.
          [Lisa gasps, looks at Alison]
Skinner: This has been a very disappointing day.  All right, on to Lisa
         Simpson.
   Bart: You're a shoo-in now, Lis.
   Lisa: After the way I've behaved, I don't deserve to win.
Skinner: Well, this doesn't deserve to win.
   Lisa: What?
-- Just desserts, 

Skinner: Ooh, now we're into the dregs.  Here's Ralph Wiggum's entry.
          [pulls sheet off]
         Pre-packaged "Star Wars" characters, still in their display
         box?  Are those the limited-edition action figures?
  Ralph: What's a diorama?
Skinner: Why it's Luke, and Obi-Wan, and my favorite, Chewie!  They're
         all here!  [to Miss Hoover] What do you think?
 Hoover: [bored] I think it's lunch time.
Skinner: We have a winner!
-- Nonbiased judging, 

The children cheer as Lisa and Alison look at each other in disbelief.

After school, Lisa apologizes to Alison for her egregious behavior.

  Lisa: I'm really sorry about what I did, Alison.  It's no shame being
        second to you.
Alison: Thank you, Lisa.  You know, I'm actually kind of glad I lost.
        Now I know that losing isn't the end of the world.  Hey, you
        still think we can be friends?
  Lisa: Only if we're the best.
 Ralph: [skipping with his diorama] I beat the smart kids!  I beat the
        smart kids!  I -- [trips]
         [unhappy] I bent my Wookie.
  Lisa: Hey Ralph, want to come with me and Alison to play "Anagrams"?
Alison: We take proper names and rearrange the letters to form a
        description of that person.
 Ralph: My cat's breath smells like cat food.
-- "Smitten" by "Mittens", 

The children walk off together.

EPISODE SUMMARY: 
[Syndication cuts are marked in curly braces "{}" and are courtesy of
Frederic Briere.]

Marge reads a romance novel tearfully in bed one night while Homer
sleeps next to her.

Marge: [sniffling] This romance is so full of heartfelt passion.  I can
       really identify with this corn-fed heroine.
        [turns to Homer] Homer...Homer, you awake?  This is important --
       give me some sign you're awake...
Homer: [belches]
Marge: [annoyed] Wake up!
Homer: [slurred] Wha?  What's wrong?  House run away?  Dog's on fire?
Marge: Homey, do you think the romance has gone out of our lives?
Homer: [belches]
-- A definitive answer, 

Marge: [annoyed] Wake up!
Homer: Marge, it's 3:00am and I worked all day!
Marge: It's 9:30pm and you spend your whole Saturday drinking beer in
       Maggie's kiddie pool!
        [clip from 9F06: Homer pulling hotdog from kiddie pool]
       Homer, young people learn about love from adults and we've been
       setting a terrible example for our children and the community in
       general.  I want us to deal with the issues raised by this book.
Homer: [takes it] Hmm...
        [clip from 8F17: book lands on fire]
Marge: Hmm...I knew we shouldn't have put a fireplace in the bedroom.
-- It's good for snuggling, however, 

The next day the children are watching a clip from Itchy and Scratchy in
9F01, "Flay Me to the Moon", and laughing uproariously.

       [kids laughs at Itchy and Scratchy]
Marge: How many times can you laugh at that cat getting hit by the moon?
 Bart: It's a _new_ episode.
 Lisa: Not exactly...they pieced it together from old shows, but it
       seems new to the trusting eyes of impressionable youth.
 Bart: Really?
 Lisa: Ren and Stimpy do it all the time.
Marge: Yes they do, and when was the last time you heard anyone talk
       about Ren and Stimpy?
-- Not since the cartoon awards in 9F16, 

The family sit around the kitchen table.

Marge: Children, your father and I have fed and clothed you but we've
       neglected something more important: it's time to learn about
       love.
 Bart: No need, Mom.  We already learned in school.
        [0:38 clip from 8F22: Fuzzy and Fluffy Bunny]
Marge: I mean "romance", not "love".
 Lisa: Mom, romance is dead.  It was acquired in a hostile takeover by
       Hallmark and Disney, homogenized, and sold off piece by piece.
-- No cynicism here, 

Marge disagrees, claiming romance is all around them, citing examples
from 9F13 (Ned serenading Maude) and 9F05 (Smithers dreaming of Burns
flying through the window).

Marge: All you have to do [to remember romance] is think about your most
       cherished memories.
 Bart: Hmm...
        [flashback to 7G01]7G01]
  Moe: [on the phone] Moe's Tavern.
 Bart: Hello, is Al there?
  Moe: Al?
 Bart: Yeah, Al.  Last name, Coholic.
  Moe: Lemme check.  [turns] Phone call for Al...Al Coholic?
  Moe: Er, Jacques Strap?  [7G06][7G06]
  Moe: Is I. P. Freely here?  [7G03][7G03]
  Moe: Hey, is there a Butz here?  Seymour Butz?  [7F11][7F11]
  Moe: Uh...Homer Sexual?  [7F15][7F15]
  Moe: Mike Rotch?  [7F22][7F22]
  Moe: Er, Amanda Huggenkiss?  [9F06][9F06]
  Moe: Uh, Hugh Jass?  [8F08][8F08]
  Moe: Ivana Tinkle?  [9F06][9F06]
  Moe: I'm a stupid moron with an ugly face and a big butt and my butt
       smells and...I like to kiss my own butt.  [8F02][8F02]
-- Yeah, _true_ romance, 

"No, no, no," emphasizes Marge.

Marge: Ask your heart what its fondest desire is.
Homer: Hmm...
        [flashback]
Homer: Mmm...chocolate.  [9F17][9F17]
Homer: Mmm...invisible cola.  [1F03][1F03]
Homer: Mmm...forbidden donut.  [1F04][1F04]
Homer: {Mmm...sacrilicious.  [1F14]}[1F14]}
Homer: {Mmm...snouts.  [8F17]}[8F17]}
Homer: {Mmm...free goo.  [1F06]}[1F06]}
Homer: {Mmm...something.}
-- Don't get too specific, now, 

But Marge still isn't getting through.

Marge: No, think about people.  Think about moments in your life that
       have been very romantic.
Homer: Oh, OK.
        [clip from 1F14: Homer kissing Flanders at football game]
Marge: That's not the idea at all...
-- 

Marge gives in and decides to tell the family about her almost-affair
with Jacques.  A 3:06 clip from 7G11 runs which Marge narrates over.

Marge: I made the right decision to stay with my Homey, so there was no
       harm done.
Homer: [groans]
Marge: So if you kind of mentally snip out the part where I already had
       a husband, that's my idea of romance.
Homer: Marge, I want you to stop seeing the Jacques.  You can let him
       down gently, but over the next couple of months I want you to
       break it off.
Marge: Er, OK, Homer...
Homer: Whew!  That was a close one, kids.
-- Marge, reasonable acquiescer, 

[End of Act One.  Time: 8:07]

Homer decides he has a confession to make as well.

Homer: OK, Marge: as long as we're traumatizing the kids, _I_ have a
       scandalous story of my own.
        [3:27 {2:57 in syndication} clip from 1F07: Homer and Mindy]
 Bart: What happened to Mindy?
Marge: [angry] Yes, what _did_ happen to her?
Homer: Ehh, she hit the bottle pretty hard and lost her job.
Marge: Hmph.  Good.
-- Not exactly a gracious reaction, 

Marge: Does anyone else have a love story?
 Lisa: Yes, I do.  And just like your love stories, it's tragic and
       filled with hurt feelings and scars that will never heal.
        [2:31 clip from 9F13: Lisa and Ralph]
Marge: Lisa, not all romances turn out that way.  Bart, do you have a
       love story that doesn't end in heartbreak?
 Bart: Yes, I do.
        [0:28 clip from 9F06: Bart and Laura]
       Wait...that _did_ end in heartbreak.  Thanks for opening up old
       wounds, _Mom_.
Marge: Hmm.
-- 

[End of Act Two.  Time: 15:28]

Marge: [bright] Well, as Jerry Lee Lewis would say, "There's a whole
       lotta frownin' going on".  [laughs, then says "Mmm..."]
 Lisa: Mom, doesn't _any_ love story have a happy ending?
Marge: Of course!  Remember when...uh...your aunt Selma got married?
        [0:04 flashback to 8F20: Sideshow Bob rubbing Selma's feet]
Selma: Ooh, oh, good, mm.
  Bob: [quietly] Soon I will kill you --
Marge: [in the present] Oh wait, wait, that's no good.  I know...your
       _grandfather_?, remember?
        [2:15 clip from 1F20: Grampa and Mrs. Bouvier]
 Lisa: That doesn't seem like a happy ending.  That seems more like a
       detached tale of modern alienation.
Marge: I give up.  Did anybody learn anything about love tonight?
 Bart: We learned it screws everybody up.
Marge: Well, there's that side of it, but there's also -- oh, help me
       out here, Lisa.
 Lisa: Sorry, Mom.  I've decided to save my love for someone who's
       guaranteed not to reject me.  [pulls out "Non-Threatening Boys"]
       Soon, Corey, soon.
-- Here are some words that rhyme with Corey: ..., "Another Simpsons
    Clip Show"

Marge sighs.

Marge: Well kids, I tried, but maybe you're right.
Homer: Wait a minute, Marge.  Love isn't hopeless.  Maybe I'm no expert
       on the subject, but there was one time I got it right.
        [1:32 clip from 7F12: Marge and Artie, then Marge and Homer]
 Lisa: Aw, your first kiss...
Homer: But not the last.
        [seven clips of Marge and Homer kissing, from 7G10, 7F10, 7F02,
       8F10, 8F10, 8F18, 1F08]1F08]
Marge: Oh, Homey...
        [they kiss again]
       You see, kids?  That's what I mean by romance.
        [kids laugh in the other room at Itchy and Scratchy]
-- I guess they prefer violence, 

Homey and Marge kiss anyway, ignoring their violence-obsessed children.

[End of Act Three.  Time: 21:06]

 EPISODE TITLE: Itchy and Scratchy Land


EPISODE SUMMARY: 
[Syndication cuts are marked in curly braces "{}" and are courtesy of
Frederic Briere and Ricardo Lafaurie.]

Bart and Lisa watch an Itchy and Scratchy episode, "The Last Traction
Hero".  Scratchy works out with a large dumbbell; after three overhead
lifts, his entire upper body becomes huge and muscular.  He flexes a
bit, proud, then walk over to Itchy menacingly.  Upon seeing him flex
his biceps and chest, Itchy thinks for a moment, then smiles and pulls
out a pink balloon and a pin.  He bursts the balloon, then pokes
Scratchy in the chest, hoping for the same result, but all that happens
is that a drop of blood leaks out.  Scratchy laughs evilly, but Itchy
pokes many holes in his upper torso in rapid succession.  This, too,
seems to have no effect, and Scratchy laughs again, but as the blood
leaks out from all the pinpricks, Scratchy feels weak and sits down on a
bench to rest.  Itchy brandishes a chainsaw and slices off the cat's
bicep and chest muscles.

Bart and Lisa, as usual, laugh.  Itchy stops and turns to the camera.

   Itchy: Thanks, kids.  Now we'd like to speak to you seriously for a
          moment.
Scratchy: Yup.  This week is the grand opening of "Itchy and Scratchy
          Land" -- the violentest place on earth[tm].
   Itchy: And to celebrate, for this week only, we're cutting ticket
          prices in half.  [pulls out scissors]
           [Scratchy pulls out a card saying "ticket prices"]
           [Itchy stabs the scissors through Scratchy's brain]
Scratchy: Yow!  [pulls out scissors and brain together]
           [stars drooling moronically]
           [camera pulls out to show Krusty standing next to a TV which
          he turns off]
  Krusty: Kids, you heard the cartoon rat.  If you haven't already run
          to your parents begging to go, do it now.  You won't be
          missing anything funny: I'll just be sitting here reading this
          grownup's newspaper.  ["Racing Form"] [laughs] Go now!
-- Those krazy klown endorsements, 

Bart and Lisa scream briefly then run off.  Homer sits on the couch
reading the Bible as the children run in.

     Lisa: Dad, remember how you said going to 
           would be too damned expensive?
    Homer: Oh, everything's too damned expensive these days.  Look at
           this bible I just got -- fifteen bucks!  And talk about a
           preachy book...everybody's a sinner!  [points to a verse]
           Except for this guy.
     Bart: But now  is cutting ticket prices in
           half!  Can we go, Dad?  Can we, can we, can we?  Take it,
           Lis.
     Lisa: Can we?
    Homer: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Ask your mother.
Bart+Lisa: Yay!  [run off]
-- Homer's new religious bent, 

Bart and Lisa run into the kitchen.

 Bart: Mom, guess what?
 Lisa: We're going to !
Marge: No.  I've already planned our vacation.  We're going to the
       Highway Nine Bird Sanctuary.  I understand they've installed a
       new birdfeeder this year.
        [Bart and Lisa look aghast]
Marge: It's shaped like a diner.  And it's on this really tall pole.
        [Bart and Lisa look aghast]
-- How to bring your children down hard, 

That night as Homer and Marge sleep, Lisa pulls Bart into their room in
a wagon.

      [Lisa enters the parents' bedroom with Bart in tow]
Lisa: Mom, Dad!  Bart's dead!
       [Homer and Marge wake up, gasp]
Bart: [coming alive] That's right: dead serious about going to Itchy and
      Scratchy Land.
       [Homer and Marge groan]
-- How to give your parents a heart attack, 

Lisa pleads their case, pulling out a pamphlet about the park.

 Lisa: You know,  isn't for kids.  They have a
       place called "Parents' Island".
        [Homer and Marge look interested]
       Yeah!  Dancing, bowling, fashionable shops, over one hundred bars
       and saloons, _and_ a world-class chemical dependency center.
Homer: [looks at pamphlet] [gasps] TV Town!  Hammock Land!
Marge: Hmm, Recipe-Related Bumper Cars.
-- Something for everyone, it seems, 

Bart and Lisa gasp, look at one another, then cheer and jump on the bed,
sure they've won their parents over.

Marge: Now wait a minute, I'm not sure about this.  Every time we've
       ever gone on vacation I end up being horribly embarrassed.  We
       end up in a big fight and we come home more miserable than when
       we left.  You have to promise me that this isn't going to happen
       this time.
Homer: Embarrassed?  What are you talking about?
Marge: Well, there was our trip to the Amish country...
Homer: Oh, yeah...
        [flashback to Homer sticking ice cream cones on a man's head]
Homer: Heh heh heh, hey look, Marge!  They're still not fighting back.
       [shoves another ice cream cone on man's cheek]
       Hee hee!  I can be a jerk and no one can stop me!  [laughs]
        [a mule kicks him hard]
Marge: Even worse was our trip to Sandy Beach...
        [flashback to people in ocean being frightened off by a shark
       fin]
Homer: [coming out of the water wearing a mask and a strap-on fin]
       [laughs] Suckers.
 Bart: [swimming up beside Homer, also with mask and fin] [laughs]
Homer: Aah!  Sharkboy!  [runs off in a panic]
-- The dreaded Homo Sharkus, 

Marge: This year I want us to do things together as a family, and get a
       lot of good exercise outdoors so we'll have a lot of wonderful
       memories of our vacation.
 Bart: Don't worry Mom, we'll make you proud of us.
        [Homer packs a suitcase and lists off the items]
Homer: Lobster hat, Fishnet Speedo Junior[tm], wheelie shoes, "Invisible
       Dog" leash...[laughs] Well, I'm packed.
-- Packed for embarrassment, certainly, 

The car is packed with everyone inside, and Marge gives last-minute
instructions to Grampa about how to care for the pets.

 Marge: And remember, every morning give one bowl of Kibble to Santa's
        Little Helper.  Do you want me to write any of this down?
   Abe: No!  I ain't senile, dad blast it.
 Marge: OK, bye bye.
 Homer: Bye!
  Bart: Bye!
  Lisa: Bye Grampa!
         [Homer drives off]
Grampa: Wait a minute!  What was that last thing you said?  "Grampa's
        Little Helper"...what's that?  [meekly to animals] Which one of
        you is the mailman?
         [animals roll their eyes slowly towards one another]
-- Not senile, just a little weird, 

In the car...

   Homer: OK, let's make a pact.  This is going to be the best vacation
          ever, or we'll all agree to disband and join other families.
Everyone: Agreed.
-- The motion is passed, 

Homer drives past a sign with an arrow that reads, "To some other
state".

   Homer: Ah, the Interstate.  Fasten your seat belts, kids: we're on
          our way to !
           [pulls up to highway...which is gridlocked]
Everyone: D'oh!
   Homer: Don't worry, I've got an ace up my sleeve.
           [honks horn]
-- Homer, wearing a t-shirt, 

Bart and Lisa look bored on the trip, {but suddenly they stare with
disbelief out the window.  They pass a sign saying "Next Flickey's: 680
miles".  The children continue to stare as they pass signs for 416
miles, 277 miles, and 42 miles.  "Dad, can we stop at Flickey's?" asks
Bart hopefully as they get close.  "No," says Homer crossly, driving
right past the restaurant.  The next sign says "Next Flickey's: 25000
miles."}

{They drive up to a fruit and vegetable checkpoint.}

Homer: {Oh my God...what'll I do, what'll I do?}
Marge: {What's the matter with you, Homer?  We don't have any fruits or
       vegetables in the car.}
Homer: {[winces] The whole trunk's full of 'em, Marge!
        [Homer holds a pamphlet: "Smuggled vegetables: the road to E-Z
       success"]}
  Kid: {[approaching car] Got any fruits or vegetables?
        [Homer panics, floors it, smashes wooden barrier]
        [fruits and vegetables spill from the trunk in a trail]
       Hey...Mr. Wembley, it happened again!}
-- The road to E-Z imprisonment, 

Homer reaches for the radio.

Homer: And now to absorb some local color through the magic of AM radio.
 DJ 1: -- book of Revelations tells us to watch for the seven signs of
       evil --
 DJ 2: -- sign of evil number four --
 DJ 3: -- inuing our "Sign of Evil" countdown.  Here's Vanessa Williams
       --
-- That's what she gets for posing in Penthouse, "Itchy and Scratchy
    Land"

The family makes a stop at the legendary "Five Corners" where five
different states touch.  Each family member stands in a different state
with everyone holding hands.  "Aw, haven't we stood in five different
states long enough?" whines Lisa.  "No," answers Homer curtly.

As night falls, Marge and Homer both yawn.

Marge: We better find a motel and stop for the night.
Homer: [slurred] We don't need to do that, Marge.  I'm not tired, I'm
       not tired at all.
        [car skids on road, crashes into pole, bursts into flame]
        [the family watches through the window of a motel room]
 Bart: Whew!  Glad that wasn't us.
-- 

The next day on the road, Homer tries to navigate.

Homer: [looking at map] North...south...aw, nuts to this!  I'm going to
       take a shortcut.
Marge: Homer, no, you're going to get lost.
Homer: Trust me, Marge.  With today's modern cars, you _can't_ get lost,
       what with all the silicon chips and such.
-- A typical Homer non sequitur, 

Homer turns off the highway onto a dirt road.  In the next shot, the car
is missing its roof and has a wooden cart wheel in place of one of its
tires.  A US Army missile and school crossing sign decorate its front
while a homecoming banner drags behind it.  But they _have_ arrived at
, as Homer promised.  A chicken flies out of
Marge's hair as Homer says, "All right, we're here.  Now let us never
speak of the shortcut again."

The family walk away from their car and Homer asks everyone to remember
that they're in the Itchy lot.  The camera pulls back to show a huge
number of cars in the same lot, then pans to show another packed lot
called the Scratchy lot.

The family takes a helicopter to the island.

Pilot: We're now approaching our final destination, Itchy and Scratchy
       Land: the amusement park of the future where nothing can possi-
       blye go wrong.
        [everyone looks worried]
       Er, possi_bly_ go wrong.  Heh, that's the first thing that's ever
       gone wrong.
-- Second, actually, the first being that nothing could go wrong, "Itchy
    and Scratchy Land"

The helicopter flies into the mouth of a giant stone Scratchy hewn from
the very living rock.

[End of Act One.  Time: 7:03]

The entrance to the park is a bustle of activity.  Above the "Itchy &amp;
Scratchy Land Grand Opening" sign, a giant Itchy repeatedly pounds a
giant Scratchy's head with a bat, while the latter pounds the former in
turn with a mallet.  The ticket booths are large bombs with lit wicks.
At the booth the Simpsons are in front of, a sign announces the rides
not working today: the Head Basher, the Blood Bath, the Mangler, and the
Nurse's Station.  Homer steps up to the booth.

Homer: One adult and four children.
Woman: Would you like to buy some Itchy and Scratchy Money?
Homer: What's that?
Woman: Well it's money that's made just for the park.  It works just
       like regular money, but it's, er..."fun".
 Bart: Do it, Dad.
Homer: Well, OK, if it's fun...let's see, uh...I'll take $1100 worth.
        [he walks in, sees all the signs: "No I&amp;S Money", "We Don't Take
       Itchy and Scratchy Money", etc.]
       Aw!
-- So much for fun, 

One "ride" is the "Tavern on the Scream", the door to which is guarded
by a giant Itchy in a chef's uniform who chops in front of the entrance
with a meat cleaver repeatedly.  The family runs inside, Homer just
missing getting chopped.

 Bart: Oh wow, cool!
 Lisa: Aw, cool!  That is neato.
Marge: Such a violent motif.
 Bart: Yeah, but it's just pretend violence, which is _actually_
       beneficial for children.  [kicks Lisa]
 Lisa: Ow!  [punches Bart]
 Bart: Ow!
Marge: Hmm...
Guard: [laughs] There's no need to murmur, ma'am.  Here at Itchy and
       Scratchy Land we're just as concerned about violence as you are.
       That's why we're always careful to show the consequences of
       deadly mayhem so that we may educate as well as horrify.
Marge: _When_ do you show the consequences?  On TV that mouse pulled out
       that cat's lungs and played them like a bagpipe, but in the next
       scene the cat was breathing comfortably.
Guard: Just like in real life.
        [pause]
        [pointing] Hey, look over there!
        [family does so, he takes off quickly]
-- A Hutz-esque argument, 

The next scene shows Bart opening a menu shaped like a bomb.

  Bart: [to waiter] I'll have a Brain Burger with extra pus, please.
 Marge: Bart!
 Homer: Eyeball stew.
 Marge: Homer!  We just got here and already I'm mortified beyond belief
        by your embarrassing behavior.
  Bart: I was just ordering a cheeseburger, Mom.  They have violent
        names for everything here.
 Marge: Oh, I see.  All right, hmm...I'll have the Baby Guts.
Waiter: Lady, you disgust me.  Ew.
  Lisa: [embarrassed] Mom, that's veal.
 Marge: Oh...
-- Mmm...extra pus, 

Marge drops Maggie off at the child care center and asks the woman
working there, "Are you sure she'll have fun here?"  The woman assures
her that babies love the ball room.  She puts Maggie in a room full of
plastic balls, and Maggie sinks down through them -- as have many other
babies.

"Torture Land"..."Explosion Land"..."Searing Gas Pain Land"...
"Unnecessary Surgery Land"...hmm...
-- Marge reads the park map, 

Homer exclaims, "Oh, look!  It's the 12:00 noon robot parade.  Hurry up
or we'll have to wait for the 12:05 parade."  Bombs and sticks of
dynamite with legs march along to an up-beat version of the Itchy and
Scratchy theme music.  A Scratchy robot wields an axe; an Itchy robot
runs a chainsaw.  Bart and Lisa smile as they watch.

An Itchy and Scratchy robot pair walk next to each other and hit each
other with mallets; blood even flies from their heads.  Another pair
shoot each other repeatedly with short bursts from a machine gun.  The
people watching the parade getting splattered by blood don't seem to
mind -- rather, they seem to be enjoying it.  "Wow," gasps Bart, "this
is so much like my dreams, it's scary."  A steamroller driven by a man
in an Itchy costume rolls by, a flattened Scratchy rolling around and
around on its roller, followed by some marching axes.

 Lisa: Aw, look at that cute little baby ax.
        [baby ax runs to catch up with bigger axes]
Marge: It's cute, but I'm sure it's very sharp and probably dirty.
Guard: [walks up] [laughs] Dirty, mabye -- dangerous, hardly.  These are
       the latest state-of-the-art animatronic robots.  They have
       sensors that ensure they only attack each other, never the
       guests.  [laughs]
        [Itchy robot's point of view shows it identifying "Scratchy" and
       "Kill", then "humans" and "Do not hurt"]
        [robot turns, takes the top of its head off and bows]
Marge: See all that stuff in there, Homer?  That's why your robot never
       worked.
-- What without all those silicon chips and such, "Itchy and Scratchy
    Land"

After the parade, the family enter the "Log Ride" which appears to have
a steep, tall mountain as part of it.  They are seated in a log-shaped
boat and metal handrails are locked in front of them as the ride begins.
"This is just what I hoping for -- spending the day together as a family
--" Marge begins, but just then the log drops suddenly down a steep
slope and everyone screams.  The log goes through a series of crossbows
and cannons which fire and just miss them, stopping suddenly inches shy
of long metal spikes placed strategically at eye-level.  But the horror
doesn't have time to sink in as the boat falls down another steep slope
straight towards a buzzsaw.  The boat is sliced in half (the family
managing barely to avoid the same fate), and its members are dumped
unceremoniously on a mat next to the river.  Bart and Lisa cheer
happily.

Marge: You know, part of spending time together as a family is spending
       time apart as individuals.
Homer: Parents' Island?
Marge: Y'uh huh.  I'm sure we'll appreciate each other all the more when
       we meet up at dinner.  Are you kids going to be all right?
       [looks around] Kids?
        [Bart and Lisa start the ride over again, grinning]
-- The end of the Log Ride, 

So Marge and Homer walk to Parents' Island.  They see "Itchy's 70s Disco
(Est. 1980)" and walk inside and are amazed at the lighted squares on
the floor and the disco-style Itchy and Scratchy theme song playing.

    Homer: It _is_ the seventies!  Right down to the smallest detail.
    Marge: Hey...the bartender even looks like John Travolta.
Bartender: Yeah..."looks like".
-- At Itchy's 70s Disco, 

Bart and Lisa have found the gift shop.

  Bart: Look at all this great stuff, Lis!
         [finds vanity license plate rack]
        Cool...personalized plates!  "Barclay"..."Barry"..."Bert"...
        "Bort"?  Aw, come on.  "Bort"?
 Child: Mommy, mommy!  Buy me a license plate.
Mother: No.  Come along, Bort.
   Man: Are you talking to me?
Mother: No, my son is also named Bort.
-- At the gift shop, 

Lisa stands in front of a display of stuffed animals.

Lisa: Who are all these characters?
Bart: Well, you're probably too young to remember the short-lived "Itchy
      &amp; Scratchy and Friends Hour".  They had to come up with some
      friends.  There's Disgruntled Goat, Uncle Ant, Ku Klux Klam...
Lisa: Oh yeah, heh.  They weren't very funny.
Bart: I dunno...Disgruntled Goat had his moments.
-- Nightmare cartoons of the mid-eighties, 

A man in an Itchy costume walks up capers in front of the children.
Bart steps on his toe hard.  Something cracks and the man groans, his
still-smiling costume belying his pain.

Meanwhile, at T. G. I. McScratchy's Goodtime Foodrinkery, Homer and
Marge have donned party hats and are dancing to music played by a live
band.

Bandleader: Welcome to T. G. I. McScratchy's where it's constantly New
            Year's Eve.  Here we go again!  Three, two, one!
  Everyone: Happy new year!
             ["Auld Lang Syne" starts up]
             [a waiter walks up with champagne glasses]
     Marge: It must be wonderful to ring in the new year over and over
            and over.
    Waiter: Please, kill me.
-- At least he hasn't been hiccupping for 45 years, "Itchy and Scratchy
    Land"

{At Itchy's Mine Field (presented by Laramie Cigarettes) Bart and Lisa
run through a barren field and purposely step on mines, which explode
and toss the children into the air.  They exit, laughing, as a man in a
Scratchy costume waves at them.  As an afterthought, Bart runs back and
kicks the man in the shin, and he yells.}

Maggie manages to claw her way to the surface of the sea of balls, as do
the other babies.  "The babies look unhappy," observes one of the women
running the place, but the other woman tells her simply to add more
balls, which she does.

Bart and Lisa watch "The Roger Meyers Story" in a stand-up movie
theater.

Roger Meyers senior, the gentle genius behind Itchy and Scratchy, loved
and cared about almost all the peoples of the world.  And he, in turn,
was beloved by the world, except in 1938 when he was criticized for his
controversial cartoon, "Nazi Supermen Are Our Superiors".
-- The narrator tells "The Roger Meyers Story", "Itchy and Scratchy
    Land"

"Among his proudest achievements was the full-length musical
`Scratchtasia'," continues the narrator.  A clip shows Scratchy dressed
in a red robe wearing a blue hat with white stars trying to escape being
chopped by Itchy with an ax.  Scratchy manages to wrest the ax from the
mouse's grasp, then, glaring threateningly, he chases the mouse through
a door.  In silhouette we see Scratchy chop the hapless Itchy into
pieces.  Relieved, he walks back into the room, but the individual
pieces of Itchy each turn into a miniature ax-wielding Itchy.  The
troupe threaten Scratchy again, but he chops them all up and pounds them
into a red pulp.  Exhausted, he pulls up a stool, sits down, and
breathes deeply.  The fumes from the Itchy pulp enter his body and turn
into microscopic Itchys that hack away at his insides.  Scratchy grows
old quickly, his skin wrinkling and turning grey, then crumbling from
his body.

Outside, at another robot parade, a yokel drawls, "Hey Moe, I'm gonna
get me a picture of this crazy critter."  The flash from his camera
makes a Scratchy robot spark.  The ubiquitous guard walks up, laughs
nervously, and says, "Uh, no flash photography, please."  The sick robot
walks disjointedly away.

Bart and Lisa continue to watch "The Roger Meyers Story".

Narrator: Roger Meyers' next full-length feature was the wildly
          successful "Pin-Itchy-o".
Scratchy: [Italian accent] Now you be good Pin-Itchy-o, and don't you
          lie.
   Itchy: I promise I will never hurt you.
           [his nose grows suddenly, spearing Scratchy's eyeball]
Scratchy: Ouch!
    Lisa: I wonder if this kind of violence really _does_ desensitize
          us?
           [berserk Scratchy robot crashes through screen.  Its head
          pops off and blood spurts]
    Bart: Want to get a Sno Cone[tm]?
    Lisa: OK.
-- Lisa's question, suddenly rhetorical, 

The children exit the theater.  Bart's eye is captured by a man in an
Itchy costume waving to children.

 Bart: So, Mr. Itchy, you think you're God's gift to women, do you?
 Lisa: Don't do it, Bart.
        [Bart pulls a stink bomb from his "Li'l Bastard Traveling Kit"
       and slingshots it straight into Itchy's mouth]
Itchy: [choking] I just wanted to entertain!
 Bart: [laughs] Can you believe I keep getting away with this...officer?
       [a uniformed man puts a hand on his shoulder]
-- They'll be asking _you_ the questions soon, 

Two officers take him down to level B4 on an elevator, then drive him
down a tunnel on an electric cart.  They drive past a control room
filled with men in white coats in front of monitors.

Man 1: Mop and bucket man to the exit of the "Nauseator".
Man 2: We got another jumper on the roof of T. G. I. McScratchy's.
Man 3: We need more "Bort" license plates in the gift shop.  I repeat,
       we are sold out of "Bort" license plates.
-- Inside the control room, 

They also drive past the robot repair room.  A man removes the metal
plate from the face of a Scratchy robot; a whirring noise is heard.  The
man comments, "I really wish they wouldn't scream."

Bart is taken to the detention area and thrown in a cell.  Homer is in
the same cell sitting on a bench.

     Bart: Dad?
    Homer: Aw, I kicked one of those stupid Itchy characters in the
           butt.
     Bart: Yeah.  There's just no way to resist it, is there.
            [inside a gift shop]
    Marge: I want all five t-shirts to say "Best Vacation Ever".
Announcer: Attention, Marge Simpson: your son has been arrested.
    Woman: I'd be terrible embarrassed if _I_ were that boy's mother.
    Marge: [groans]
Announcer: Attention, Marge Simpson: we've also arrested your older,
           balder, fatter son.
    Marge: Mmm...
-- Son, husband, what's the difference?, 

Marge is led to the cell where Homer and Bart are being detained.

  Marge: Oh, I'm so embarrassed I wish there was a hole I could just
         crawl into and die.
Officer: OK, throw her in the hole.
  Marge: Oh, please: it was just a figure of speech!
-- Marge in Homer and Bart's detention cell, 

Dr. John Frink arrives in the robot repair room on a cart and speaks
passionately to some of the repairmen.

    Frink: You've got to listen to me.  Elementary chaos theory tells us
           that all robots will eventually turn against their masters
           and run amok in an orgy of blood and kicking and the biting
           with the metal teeth and the hurting and shoving.
Repairman: How much time do we have, professor?
    Frink: [checks clipboard] Well, according to my calculations, the
           robots won't go berserk for at least 24 hours.
            [Scratchy robot grabs men by the throat]
            [Itchy robot goes after another man]
           Oh, I forgot to, er, carry the one.
-- A small miscalculation, 

Marge manages to get her husband and son released.  They walk out.

Marge: I have nothing to say to you.
Homer: But Marge, I was a political prisoner!
Marge: How were you a political prisoner?
Homer: I kicked a giant mouse in the butt!  Do I have to draw you a
       diagram?
-- Homer, master flowcharter, 

Suddenly, the power goes off all over the park.  "Oh, for gosh sakes,
what now?" grumbles Marge.  A group of robots walk out, look over at the
family, then raise their weapons menacingly and walk inexorably towards
them.  Through the eyes of an Itchy robot, we see it identify Homer as
Scratchy with the message "Kill".  "Hey look, this one's coming on to
me.  Yoo hoo!  Mr. Robot!"  Homer calls flirtatiously.

[End of Act Two.  Time: 17:41]

The Itchy robot continues to walk towards Homer, its ax raised.

 Lisa: Dad, I think you're wrong about that robot trying to be your
       friend.
Homer: Lisa!  [robot swipes at him with ax] Don't [swipe!] contradict
       [swipe!] your [swipe!] elders!  [swipe!  Homer's two hairs are
       cut off] Aah!  My hair.  You chopped off my hair!  Oh God, I'm
       ugly.
-- Truth is slow to dawn sometimes, 

"I _knew_ we should have gone to the bird sanctuary," rues Marge.
There, however, everyone is suddenly chased by birds gone mad.  Hans
Moleman orders a seed bell in a phone booth as birds crash into the
glass all around him.

Our favorite family runs away from the robot horde.

Bart: A chopper!  We're saved!
 Man: [in Itchy costume] Hey!  You're the guys that didn't like our
      capering.  When you get to hell, tell 'em Itchy sent you.  [kicks
      Bart and Homer]
-- Hell hath no fury like an Itchy scorned, 

       [the robots close in]
Marge: Oh, my.  It looks like we're doomed.
Homer: Back, you robots!  Nobody ruins my family vacation but me...and
       maybe the boy!
-- He got that part right, 

Homer pulls his wallet from his pocket and throws it at the robots,
followed by two handfuls of change, a banana, his underwear...and his
camera.  The flash goes off, making four robots collapse.

 Lisa: Dad!  The flash must have scrambled their circuits.
Homer: What are you, the narrator?
 Lisa: Aah!  Just keep taking pictures!
        [Homer snaps another shot and an Itchy collapses]
 Bart: [grabbing its mallet] I'll get more cameras!
        [runs over to camera shop, smashes window, grabs cameras]
        [turns back] Smashy, smashy!  [smashes another window]
Marge: I don't approve of that...
-- Not the time for approval, 

The family all snap pictures repeatedly, and robot after robot fizzles
and falls over.

 Bart: [German accent] Hey mouse...say cheese.
        [snaps picture; an Itchy robot collapses]
       With a dry, cool wit like that, I could be an action hero.
        [the family snaps more photos]
        [Homer emerges from a pile of robots]
Homer: Die, bad robots, die!  [laughs] With a dry, cool wit like that, I
       could be an action hero.
-- Yeah, real dry, 

 Bart: Who would have thought that our visit to 
       would turn out to be our best vacation ever?
 Lisa: Yeah, best ever!
Marge: Are you two bonkers?  We almost got killed...not to mention all
       the embarrassment I suffered.
 Lisa: But Mom, it's exactly what you wanted in a vacation: it brought
       us together as a family, we got a lot of good exercise outdoors,
       and we have so many memories.
Marge: [pause] You know, you're right.  This truly _was_ the best
       vacation ever.  Now let us never speak of it again.
-- 

Roger Meyers Jr. puts in an appearance.

Meyers: As Roger Meyers Jr., the owner of the park, I'd like to thank
        you for stopping the killer robots, and to show my appreciation,
        here are two free passes.
 Homer: But there are five of us.
Meyers: [angry] Here are two free passes!
 Homer: That's better.
-- I don't get it, 

Dr. Frink kneels over the inert body of a robot.

    Frink: Man, if this is happening here, I'd hate to think of what's
           happening in Euro , n-hey.
            [shot of empty parking lot in said park]
Booth man: [French accent] Hello?   open for
           business.  Who are you to resist it, huh?
           Come on.  My last paycheck bounced.  My children need wine.
-- Art imitates life, 

Back at home, safe, the children laugh at the end of an Itchy and
Scratchy cartoon.  Marge watches it with them.

Marge: I hope you realize now that violence on TV may be funny, but it's
       not so funny when that violence is happening to you.
 Bart: [smug] But it _would_ be funny to someone who was watching us.
Marge: Hmm...
 Lisa: No, Mom, he's right.  [takes off shoe] Observe:
        [throws it at Bart]
        [Marge laughs involuntarily; Lisa and Bart laugh too]
Marge: Oh, my!  Lisa, go to your room.
 Lisa: Aw...
-- Marge refuses to see the light, 

[End of Act Three.  Time: 21:13]
 EPISODE TITLE: Sideshow Bob Roberts


EPISODE SUMMARY: 
[Syndication cuts are marked in curly braces "{}" and are courtesy of
Ricardo Lafaurie.]

The scene opens with a shot of the KBBL radio building.

No sports, no rock, no information,
For mindless chatter, we're your station!
-- KBBL radio's jingle, 

The scene shifts to Homer eating donuts at the power plant.

Announcer: KBBL talk radio.  And now Springfield's favorite conservative
           and author of the well-selling book, "Only Turkeys Have Left
           Wings."  Ladies and gentlemen, Birch Barlow.
     Carl: Ecch!  That Barlow's a right-wing crackpot.  He said Ted
           Kennedy lacked integrity!  Can you believe that?
    Lenny: Yeah, switch the station.  I consider myself politically
           correct, and his views makes me [shivers] uncomfortable.
    Homer: Nonononono, guys...I'm not very political -- I usually think
           people who vote are a bit "fruity" [Lenny and Carl walk off]
           -- but for some reason this Birch Barlow really speaks to me.
           [chomps, chews]
            [scene shift to inside KBBL; Birch chows on donuts too]
   Barlow: Good morning, fellow freedom-likers.  Birch Barlow, the
           fourth branch of government, the fifty-first state...
-- Less-than-subtle parodies, 

Barlow: You know, there are three things we're never going to get rid of
        here in Springfield: one, the bats in the public library --
         [scene switch to man opening card catalog and screaming as bats
        fly out]
        -- two, Mrs. McFierly's compost heap --
         [scene switch to huge compost pile and Mrs. McFierly rocking
        nearby with a shotgun, cackling]
        -- and three, our six-term mayor,
         [scene switch to Quimby watering a marijuana plant]
        the illiterate, tax-cheating, wife-swapping, pot-smoking,
        spendocrat Diamond Joe Quimby.
Quimby: Hey: I am no longer illiterate.
-- Slow but steady self-improvement, 

Barlow: Now, why are we doomed to this Quimby Quagmire, you ask, oh
        reasonable listener?  Because this town is under the
        stranglehold of a few tie-dyed tree-huggers who would rather
        play hackeysack than lock up the homeless.
-- Those wonderful conservative theories, 

The scene shifts to Simpson kitchen with Bart eating, Lisa taking notes,
and Marge feeding a resistant Maggie.

   Marge: [hearing radio] Mmm...this sounds awfully controversial.
          Lisa, you _know_ I don't like controversy in this house.
    Lisa: I don't like him either, Mom, but I'm doing a report on local
          politics for my school project.
    Bart: You think you're so big because your class always gets to do
          projects.  [condescending] Well, um, I'm doing a school
          project on, er, fireworks.  [displays a bundle]
   Marge: Mmm...Bart, I wish you wouldn't lie like that.  [takes bundle,
          douses it in sink, throws it away]
           [at school]
 Skinner: And now, as a special sendoff and a way to say "Gong Hei Fatt
          Choy" to our visiting Chinese principals, Bart Simpson has
          promised us a fireworks display.  [motions to Bart]
           [Bart looks at Edna and groans as she gives him "F"]
Princ. 1: All week, he promise big firework display.
Princ. 2: Bad student.
Princ. 1: Uh-uh...bad principal.
-- 

Homer and Lisa drive in the car with the radio tuned to KBBL.

Barlow: So, my friends, let's just junk those Dumbocrats and their
        bleeding-heart smellfare program.
  Lisa: Dad, I had to listen to this jerk all morning.  Can we listen to
        something else?
 Homer: When _I'm_ driving the car, _I_ get to choose the radio station.
        When _you're_ driving, we'll listen to _your_ radio station.
         [scene switch to Lisa driving and smiling as she listens to
        John Parr's "St. Elmo's Fire" theme]
 Homer: [moans] I can't take this any more!  Let's switch back.
-- Springfield, where the driving age is eight, 

They do indeed switch back as Barlow takes a phone call from a listener.

Barlow: All right, my friends, let's go to the phones.  First up is Bob
        from South Springfield.  Welcome to you, sir.
   Bob: Hello, Birch.  Long-time listener, first-time caller.  Kudos for
        bringing the public back to the Republican party.  It's high
        time people realized we conservatives aren't all Johnny
        Hatemongers, Charlie Bible Thumps, or even -- God forbid --
        George Bushes.
  Lisa: [gasps] That sounds like Sideshow Bob!
 Homer: Yes, ma'am.  Sideshow Bob, yakking it up on the old yak box.
  Lisa: Dad, I'll spare you the embarrassment of admitting you don't
        know who Sideshow Bob is.
 Homer: Phew!
-- Lisa, making it easier on Daddy, 

Lisa explains, with the help of flashbacks, who Sideshow Bob is.

 Lisa: Sideshow Bob used to be Krusty the Klown's sidekick.  In 1990 he
       framed Krusty for armed robbery and Bart got him put in jail.
Homer: Uh huh.
 Lisa: When he got out, he married Aunt Selma and tried to murder her.
Homer: Oh, Side_show_ Bob.
-- Placing the emphasis carefully, 

At home, Lisa enters Bart's room.

 Lisa: Bart, your mortal enemy is on the radio!  [turns it on]
Marty: It's time for more deeee-mentia with Dr. Demento.
 Bart: Aah!  [tosses radio out window]
Marty: And now, "The Funny Five"!
 Lisa: I meant your _other_ mortal enemy.  Sideshow Bob.
 Bart: [gasping] Sideshow Bob?  Oh.  I'm only ten and I already got two
       mortal enemies.
-- It's not clear which is more frightening, 

Quimby holds "Gripe at the Mayor" night at the Springfield Retirement
Castle.  He motions at a board with a layout for a new expressway.

Quimby: And this proposed expressway will bring increased commerce to
        our local merchants.
         [people gab amongst themselves]
   Abe: What's in it for us?
Jasper: Yeah, give us something we like or we'll ride you out of town on
        a rail!
Quimby: Ahem, well, uh, what do you people like?
Jasper: Sleep.
   Man: Sexy dames, and plenty of 'em.
   Abe: Maaatloock!
         [murmurs of assent]
Quimby: Well, I suppose I could name it the "Matlock Expressway".
         [everyone cheers]
-- His honor polls the electorate, 

Bart listens to a walkman in class.

   Bob: [on the radio] But it would be terribly myopic of me to blame
        all my current woes on one spiky-haired little simpleton.
Barlow: Mm hm, myopic.  Or to say the least, intransigent.  Now you
        mentioned some woes there.
   Bob: Well...you see, Birch, I'm presently incarcerated.
         [scene switch to prison where a riot is taking place]
        Convicted of a crime I didn't even commit.  Hah!  Attempted
        murder?  Now honestly, what is that?  Do they give a Nobel prize
        for attempted chemistry?  Do they?
         [Bob ducks as a toilet smashes overhead]
        Oh, really, now!  This _is_ a personal call.
-- Inconsiderate rioters, 

Barlow: My friends, isn't this just typical?  Another intelligent
        conservative here, railroaded by our liberal justice system,
        just like [reads lists] Colonel Oliver North, officer Stacey
        Koons, and cartoon Smokespeson Joe Camel.
         [scene switch back to Bart listening to walkman in class]
        Well, I've had it!  I am going to make it my mission to see that
        our friend Bob is set free.
  Bart: Nooo!  [class stops, looks at him]
  Edna: Well, _despite_ Bart's objections, the people of South Africa
        can now vote in free democratic elections.
-- Bart's secret pro-apartheid agenda, 

The scene switches to Moe's, where everyone listens to the radio.

Barlow: [on the radio] My friends, Bob is a political prisoner.  I want
        every loyal listener to do everything they can to get him out of
        jail.
   Moe: All right, you heard the man.  [pulls out a box] One grenade
        each.  [hands them out]
Barney: Moe, I think he meant through nonviolent, grassroots political
        action.
   Moe: Aw, geez, really, you think so?  [pause] All right, give 'em
        back.  [everyone moans] C'mon, everybody, give 'em back.  Hey.
        Hey!  Who pulled the pin on this one?
-- Fire in the hole, 

The headline on the Springfield Shopper reads, "Bob Pardon: #1 Local
Issue", with a subheading, "Edges Out 'No Fat Chicks' Ordinance".
Quimby puts his fist down.

Quimby: Very well.  If that is the way the winds are blowing, let no one
        say I don't also blow.  [dials phone]
         [scene shift to Bob leaving prison]
        By special order of the mayor of Springfield, you are hereby
        granted a full and complete pardon.  Congratulations, Robert
        Underdunk Terwilliger.
   Bob: Aah!  [falls off cliff into water]
 Guard: [calling down] Boat's on the other side.
   Bob: Yes, thank you.
-- By the way, he was being sarcastic, 

[End of Act One.  Time: 6:29]

The scene opens at night with the camera moving towards a sinister-
looking castle with a sign, "Republican Party Headquarters".  Inside, a
group of men sits around a table in a large room with a fireplace.
Smithers hands out martinis to Ranier Wolfcastle, Birch Barlow, and a
ghoul, who takes his bloody martini and slurps it down.  Mr. Burns walks
in.

  Burns: Hail, brothers.  Coranon Silaria, Ozoo Mahoke.
          [everyone answers "Mahoke"]
         Now, then, gentlemen, the mayoral campaign is upon us.  And if
         we hope to defeat this Joe Quimby, we need a candidate with
         name recognition and media savvy -- a true leader who'll do
         exactly as he's told.
 Barlow: Monty, I'm way ahead of you.  If you'll just open that door
         you'll see the next mayor of Springfield.
          [door opens to reveal a water cooler; everyone applauds]
          [the cooler bubbles]
Senator: What'd it say?
 Barlow: No, no, no, Bob.  Bob, come in!
    Bob: [enters wrapped in a US flag] A fine "Mahoke" to you all.
Hibbert: Why, he's even better.
 Ranier: I agree.  I like the human touch.
-- At the Republican Party headquarters, 

At Springfield Elementary there's a "The Candidates Speak on Education"
event.  Skinner lectures the students who are assembled out on the lawn.

Skinner: Now, students, I want you to be on your best behavior for this
         carefully-choreographed media event.  Now this means there is
         to be no wising-off, no face-making, and no grass-eating.  This
         means you, Ralph.
  Ralph: [through a full mouth] Yes, sir.
-- The candidates speak at Springfield Elementary, "Sideshow Bob
    Roberts"

   Bob: Hello, children.  [with malice] Hello, Bart.
  Bart: Eep.
   Bob: Young friends, my opponent, Joe Quimby, is confused about your
        school system.  Do you know what he does?  He flip-flops.
         [does backflips; children marvel]
        Sometimes he doesn't know whether he's coming or going.
         [walks funny; children clap and cheer]
        He wants to sell your future short.
         [shrinks, walks sideways; children clap more]
  Lisa: Hmm.  Bart, we can't let Bob steal the spotlight.  We're going
        to have to stoop to the lowest common denominator.
  Bart: I can do that.
         [they jump into Quimby's arms]
Quimby: Aah!  Help!  I'm being attacked by...things!
         [cameras turn from Bob juggling to Quimby]
  Lisa: [chilidishly] [giggles] Uncle Mayor was just saying that us kids
        are the most important natural resource we have.
  Kent: More important than _coal_?!
Quimby: [uncertain] Uh, yes.
-- Kent "living in the 19th century" Brockman, 

Someone grabs Bart from Quimby's arms and drags him into a limousine.
Inside, Bart struggles as two men hold him.  Bob sits across from them.

Bob: That was a _big_ mistake, Bart.  No children have ever meddled with
     the Republican Party and lived to tell about it.
-- Bob chides Bart for his stunt, 

Bob snaps his fingers.  The two men next to Bart reach inside their
suits menacingly as Bart frets.  They pull out a red, white, and blue
elephant and a "Vote Bob" button and put them on Bart, then toss him out
of the limo on his front lawn.  The limo speeds away as Archie's jalopy
pulls up in front of the Simpson house; Homer is tossed out by Moose who
warns him, "Duh, stay out of Riverdale."

A TV commercial for Quimby is shown.

Singers: Without a Mayor Quimby, our town would really sink,
          [a garbage truck with a "Vote Quimby" ad empties a bin]
         We wouldn't have a tire yard, or a mid-size roller rink.
          [Quimby grins next to burning tires, then roller skates]
         We wouldn't have our gallows, or our shiny Bigfoot trap,
          [Quimby grins through noose, then smiles next to trap]
         It's not the mayor's fault that the stadium collapsed.
          [Quimby surveys damage sadly, then shrugs and smiles]
  Voice: Quimby.  If you were running for mayor, he'd vote for you.
         Paid for by the "Mayor Quimby for Mayor" Mayoral Committee.

Bart and Lisa do their part, handing out bumper stickers outside.

    Bart: [to passers-by] Hey Four-eyes!  Vote Quimby.  Hey Beardo!
          Vote Quimby.
    Lisa: This time he's the _lesser_ of two evils.
   Jimbo: Uh, yeah, yeah.  I love Grimby.  Uh, can I have some more
          bumper stickers, please, dude?
           [Bart gives him some]
           [Jimbo walks back to shopping cart with Milhouse inside,
          taped up with bumper stickers, and covers Milhouse's eyes with
          one]
          All right!  The mummy's ready for his mystical journey.
           [Kearney pushes the cart down a hill]
Milhouse: Aah!  What's happening?!
-- Moe Grimby for mayor?, 

{Sideshow Bob listens to gripes at the Springfield Retirement Castle.}

Abe: {That Quimby fellow promised to build us a Matlooock Expressway.
     How're you going to top that, smart guy?}
Bob: {Hmm.  Well, how's this?  I'll not only build the expressway, I
     will spend the rest of this afternoon patiently listening to your
     interminable anecdotes.}
Abe: {Hot ziggety-zam!  Me first.
      [old people surround Bob, grinning]
     Not many people know I owned the first radio in Springfield.
     Weren't much on the air then, just Edison reciting the alphabet
     over and over.  "A!" he'd say, then "B".  "C" would usually follow
     --}
Bob: {[groans] Oh...}
-- A tough promise to keep, 

A TV commercial for Sideshow Bob is shown.

       [scene shows prisoners going in a revolving door and coming out
       immediately]
Voice: Mayor Quimby supports revolving door prisons.  Mayor Quimby even
       released Sideshow Bob -- a man twice convicted of attempted
       murder.
        [scene shows prisoners leaving on escalator and ski lift]
       Can you trust a man like Mayor Quimby?  Vote Sideshow Bob for
       mayor.
-- A campaign ad for Sideshow Bob, 

The Springfield Community Center holds mayoral debates.  The camera
descends towards the table of panelists.

King: The League of Uninformed Voters presents the Springfield Mayoral
      Debates.  I'm your moderator, Larry King.  Now, a word to our
      audience: even though we're being broadcast on...Fox, there's no
      need for obnoxious hooting and hollering.
       [audience hoots and hollers]
King: Oh...
-- Enacting the status quo, 

Offstage, Bob gets a blowdry and comb.  He glances at some cue cards,
then tries on a couple of smiles before selecting one and walking out.
Quimby, meanwhile, looks terrible.  He sneezes into a hanky.

Quimby: [with a cold] I shouldn't have shaken hands with those old
        people.
         [Bart hands him some pills; Quimby eats a handful, then
        stumbles on stage]
  Lisa: I hope that flu doesn't affect his performance out there.
  Bart: Don't worry...he's taken a million of these capsules.
         [box says "Extra-Drowsy Formula"]
-- Eep, indeed, 

First question goes to Birch Barlow.

Barlow: Sideshow Bob, councilman Les Whinen says that you're not
        experienced enough to be mayor.  Sir, what do you have to say
        about that?
   Bob: I'd say that Les Whinen ought to do more thinking and less
        whining!
         [audience laughs and claps]
  Lisa: There's no councilman Les Whinen.
  Bart: [chuckling] Good line, though.
Barlow: Mayor Quimby, you're well-known, sir, for your lenient stance on
        crime.  But suppose for a second that _your_ house was ransacked
        by thugs, _your_ family tied up in the basement with socks in
        their mouths, you try to open the door but there's too much
        _blood_ on the knob --
Quimby: What is your question?
Barlow: My question is about the budget, sir.
-- The Springfield Mayoral Debates, 

Quimby groans and drips sweat.  Lisa and Bart watch, aghast, then turn
to a TV broadcast of the Mayor.  A ring of fire appears around Quimby's
head with a caption that reads, "Flames added electronically by Channel
Six".  Quimby's hair, coincidentally, points up in two places, giving
him the appearance of having horns.

It's election day.  Homer steps behind the curtain in front of a voting
booth.

 Homer: [looks at ballot information] Hmm...I don't agree with his Bart-
        killing policy, but I do approve of his Selma-killing policy.
        [votes for Bob]
Krusty: Well, he framed me for armed robbery, but man, I'm aching for
        that upper-class tax cut.  [votes for Bob]
-- Springfield voters, 

At Quimby's headquarters, everyone watches anxiously as the results come
in.

Kent: And the results are in.  For Sideshow Bob, 100%, for Joe Quimby,
      1%.  And we remind you there is a 1% margin of error.
-- The election results, 

Everyone moans and leaves.  A cleanup man sweeps for a bit, then grabs a
couple of bottles of champagne and runs out.  The news goes live to Bob
headquarters for his victory speech.  Bob laughs uncontrollably as Kent
observes, "And just look how happy he is!"

[End of Act Two.  Time: 13:29]

Home and Marge are asleep in bed when a loud banging awakens them,
shaking the whole house.

Homer: Aah!  It's the Rapture!  Quick, get Bart out of the house before
       God comes!
-- Homer is awakened by construction, 

Maggie and her stuffed toys are bounced around in her crib to the sound
of loud thudding.  Homer runs out in his pyjamas.

  Bob: So sorry, Mr. Simpson.  Your house is blocking construction of
       our new Matlock Expressway.
        [camera pulls back to show expressway looming overhead]
       Now, I am a fair man.  You will have 72 hours to vacate.  At that
       time we will blow up your house and any remaining Simpsons.
Marge: Homer, we've got to stop them!
Homer: I know what you're up to, Mayor Terwigiger.  And no one in my
       family's going to stand for it.
        [Abe honks horn from atop expressway]
  Abe: Move your goldurn house, son!
-- No one except him, 

At Springfield Elementary, Bart opens his locker as Skinner approaches.

Skinner: Bart, by special request of the Mayor's office, you are going
         to be left back.
   Bart: Oh.  You mean I have to repeat the fourth grade?
Skinner: Well, yes, but not for four or five years.  Bart, you're going
         to kindergarten.
   Bart: Kindergarten?!
   Edna: [pops champagne cork] Hah!
-- A cause for celebration, 

On Bart's first day in his new class...

Teacher: [slowly] Now, boys and girls, who knows what this is?
   Bart: [cocky] Triangle.
Teacher: Very good, Bart!  You have first choice of toys for free play.
   Bart: Cool!  I call the Flintstone Phone.
          [dials it]
   Fred: Yabba dabba do, I like talkin' to you!
-- I'll bet you do, 

At dinner, Homer laments the construction of the new highway.

Homer: We're going to lose our house and end up living under a bridge
       like common trolls.
 Lisa: I don't think Bob won that election legally.  I can't believe a
       convicted felon would get so many votes and another convicted
       felon would get so few.
-- Sound reasoning, 

So Lisa heads off to the Springfield Hall of Records.

 Man: [carrying large stack of paper] Here you go: the results of last
      month's mayor election.  All 48000 voters and who each one of them
      voted for.
Lisa: I thought this was a secret ballot.
 Man: Ehh.
-- Secret, schmecret, 

Lisa lugs the list off to a table and begins going through it.  "OK,
Aaron A. Aaronson voted for...Bob.  Aaron L. Aaronson voted for...Bob.
Arthur B. Ablabab voted for...Bob."  But she groans, tiring quickly, and
falls asleep.

A shadow approaches her and leaves an envelope in front of her.
Awakening, she notices the envelope, looks around, and seeing no one,
opens it and reads.  She gasps.

 Bart: So whoever it is who wrote that note wants to meet us here
       tonight?
 Lisa: This is so cool, Bart.  We're just like Woodward and Bernstein.
 Bart: Yeah, except their dad wasn't waiting in the car reading Archie
       comics.
Homer: Stuck-up Riverdale punks...think they're too good for me!
-- Homer's greatest failing, 

The children approach a shadowy figure with a cigarette.

     Man: You're on the right track.  Follow the names.
    Bart: How the hell do you know?
     Man: [takes a drag] I can't tell you who I am, but I worked on the
          campaign.
   Homer: [pulling up in car, shines headlights] Hey, Mr. Smithers!
Smithers: Well, you might as well give me a ride home now.
           [in the car]
          I've never gone behind Mr. Burns' back before but Sideshow
          Bob's ultra-conservative views, er, conflict with my...choice
          of lifestyle.  All I can do is give you one name: Edgar
          Neubauer.  Find him, and you'll find your answer.
-- At long last, the truth about Waylon J., 

So Lisa and Bart grab the phone book and look for him.  But they come up
blank.  (Well, Bart, at least, finds someone called "A.  Gorilla" and
laughs to himself.)  They check the library in the NEU-NEZ card catalog
(and are surprised by the bats that fly out), but nothing turns up.

Lisa: This is hopeless.  They're going to demolish our house for sure.
      We're going to have to move into a Motel Six.
Bart: But Dad can't afford six dollars a night!
-- The quest for Edgar Neubauer seems hopeless, 

Bart looks up, then runs off excitedly.

Bart: Lis!  Lis, come here, I found him!  I found Edgar Neubauer.
       [points at a tombstone: "Edgar Neubauer: Beloved husband and old
      grouch (1831-1909)"]
      Oh my God...the dead have risen and they're voting Republican.
Lisa: [gasp] No, Bart, don't you see?  Dead people can't vote.
       [pulls out list, looks at another tombstone]
      Prudence Goodwyfe, died 1641.  She voted for Bob too.  [gasps] So
      did Buddy Holly, Richie Valens, and the Big Bopper.
       [walking] Even the pet cemetery voted for Bob, look!  Mr. and
      Mrs. Bananas, Humphrey Boa-Gart...oh, my poor dead kitty, please
      not you too...
       [checks list, sees "Snowball I"]
       [angry] All right, Bob, now it's personal!
-- The Mayor crosses the line, 

The Springfield Shopper headline reads, "Call for Probe in Bob Flap",
with an editorial on "Why Not Let Dead Pets Vote?"  The bulldozers close
in on the Simpson home.  Marge threatens them with a rolling pin, and at
the last second they pull back.  Homer holds onto a wrecking ball and
gets smashed into a wall.

At the Town Hall, court is called into session.  Lionel Hutz waits for
Sideshow Bob to be led into the room.  The Mayor walks in as everyone
gasps, and he glances sideways at the Simpson children, who look away
nervously.

Hutz: Mr. Mayor, is it true you rigged the election?
 Bob: No, I did not.
Hutz: [pause] Kids, help.
       [the judge shrugs]
 Bob: Oh, I don't mind.  We want these children to feel justice has been
      served.  That way they can sleep soundly tonight on their hard,
      feculent motel pillows.
-- I'd have preferred the term, "Unsoft, somewhat rotten motel head
    rests", 

 Bob: Well Bart, Lisa...here I am.
Lisa: I have a plan.  I think we can trap him.
       [they walk up; Lisa takes a sip of water]
      You know, Sideshow Bob, I believe you when you say you're
      innocent.
 Bob: Indeed I am.
Lisa: Because we all know you're a naive pawn -- puppet, if you will --
      of the most diabolical political genius Springfield has ever
      known: Birchibald T. Barlow!
       [Barlow stammers incoherently]
      You don't have the intelligence to rig an election by yourself, do
      you?
Bart: You were just Barlow's lackey.
Lisa: You were Ronny to his Nancy!
Bart: Sonny to his Cher!
Lisa: Ringo to his rest of the Beatles!
-- Ringo "Excuse the lateness of my reply"?, 

Bob can't stand it any longer.

  Bob: Enough!  Lies, lies, lies!  I did it!  I did it all!
        [everyone gasps]
       There.
 Bart: We want the truth!
  Bob: You want the truth?  You can't handle the truth.  No truth-
       handler, you.  Bah!  I deride your truth-handling abilities.
Judge: Will you get to the point?
-- 

  Bob: Only _I_ could have executed such a masterpiece of electoral
       fraud.  And I have the records to prove it!  Here, just look at
       these -- [pulls out binders and floppy disks] each one a work of
       Machiavellian art.
Judge: But why?
  Bob: Because you _need_ me, Springfield.  Your guilty conscience may
       force you to vote Democratic, but deep down inside you secretly
       long for a cold-hearted Republican to lower taxes, brutalize
       criminals, and rule you like a king.  That's why I did this: to
       protect you from yourselves.  Now if you'll excuse me, I have a
       city to run.
Judge: Bailiffs, place the mayor under arrest.
  Bob: What?  Oh yes, all that stuff I did.
-- Mayor Bob digs his own grave (and saves), 

Lisa is jubilant as Bob is handcuffed.

Lisa: Bart, we did it!  Now we get to keep our house and you get to go
      back to the fourth grade.
Bart: Oh, tomorrow we were going to find out who the dish ran away with.
Lisa: The spoon, Bart.
Bart: [gasps, smiles] Of course!
-- Lisa wrecks the ending, 

The next day's headline reads "Toddlers Topple Mayor", with a subheading
showing Abe's picture with "Expressway Halt Rankles Elderly".  Bob
crumples the paper in disgust.

     Bob: Someday I'll have my vengeance -- someday, when I find my way
          out of this savage, roach-ridden cesspool --
           [camera pulls back to "Springfield Minimum Security Prison"]
     Man: Say, Terwilliger's a Yalie.
           [shot of men in sculling boat]
Coxswain: Bob!  Come along.  We need an eighth to row against the
          Princeton alums.
     Bob: Princeton?!  [groans]
Coxswain: Stroke!  Stroke!  Stroke...
-- No more teatimes with Snake, 

[End of Act Three.  Time: 20:58]
 EPISODE TITLE: Treehouse of Horror V


EPISODE SUMMARY: 
Marge walks from behind a red curtain onto center stage into a
spotlight.

Marge: Hello once again.  As usual, I must warn you all that this year's
       Hallowe'en show is very, very scary, and those of you with young
       children may want to send them off for bed --
        [someone hands her a paper; she reads it]
       Oh, my!  It seems the show is _so_ scary that Congress won't even
       let us show it.  Instead they've suggested the 1947 Glenn Ford
       classic movie, "200 Miles to Oregon".
        [a clip from the movie shows]
-- Introductions, 

The picture shuts off like a television being unplugged.  The little
white dot remaining at the center expands into a green line which
becomes modulated with Bart's voice like an oscilloscope trace.

       [picture shows a green line]
 Bart: There's nothing wrong with your television set.  Do not attempt
       to adjust your picture.  _We_ are controlling the transmission.
Homer: What's that, boy?  We're in control?  Hey, look!  I can see my
       voice!  [laughs] Brrr...hee!  Heeee!
        [changing pitches] Blub blub blub blub blub!  Thiiis...iiis my
       vooice...on teeeveeeee --
 Bart: Dad!  You're ruining the mood.
Homer: Sorry.
 Bart: For the next half-hour, _we_ will control what you see and hear.
       You are about to experience the terror and foul horror of...The
       Simpsons Hallowe'en Special.
        [green line turns into outline of five family members]
-- Bart opens the show, 

Lightning strikes as the show title appears and the camera swoops
towards the Springfield cemetery.  A tombstone reads, "Amusing
tombstones", another reads "RIP".  Moe's body falls from a tree in a
noose -- and suddenly opens its eyes.  Rev. Lovejoy burns Patty and
Selma, dressed as witches, at the stake; they use the flames growing
around them to light some cigarettes.  Principal Skinner's head is in a
guillotine, above the decapitated heads of Mrs. Krabappel, groundskeeper
Willy, and Chief Wiggum.  Bart appears and jumps on the basket
containing the heads, stuffing them further in.  Skinner gives the
thumbs-up, only to have his own head chopped off.  The couch scene
features zombie Simpsons with mismatched body parts which they half-
remedy once seated.

[End of Opening Credits.  Time: 1:45]

First segment title: "The Shinning"

The word "Monday" appears on the screen, followed by a vertical shot of
the Simpson car traveling along a twisty mountain road.

       [screen shows "Tuesday"]
Homer: Well, it was a long trip, but we're almost there.
Marge: Homer, did you remember to lock the front door of the house?
Homer: D'oh!
        [screen shows "Wednesday"]
Homer: Well, it's been two long trips, but we're finally almost there
       again.
Marge: When you locked the front door, did you remember to lock the back
       door?
Homer: D'oh!  D'oh!
        [screen shows "Thursday"]
        [family drives along in sullen silence]
 Lisa: [gasps] Oh no!  We left Grampa back at the gas station.
        [silence]
       What about Grampa?
-- What _about_ him?, 

The family continues their drive towards a large mansion in the
mountains.

          [the Simpsons pull up, hop out of the car, and wave]
   Burns: Oh, goody: the Sea Monkeys I ordered have arrived.  Heh heh
          heh, look at them cavort and caper.
Smithers: Sir, they're the new winter caretakers for the lodge.
   Burns: Yes...they work hard and they play hard.
-- And use Right Guard, probably, 

Burns takes the family on a tour of the lodge, down a hall with axes
mounted all along the wall.

Burns: This house has quite a long and colorful history.  It was build
       on an ancient Indian burial ground and was the setting of satanic
       rituals, witch-burnings, and five John Denver Christmas specials.
Homer: [revolted] Ohh, John Denver.
        [they stop in front of the elevator, which opens and disgorges a
       river of blood]
Burns: Hmm, that's odd.  Usually the blood gets off at the second floor.
-- The five warning signs of a bad lodge, 

Outside, the camera stars high above a hedge maze and zooms down to
Willy watering one part of it.

       [a chainsaw noise is heard]
 Bart: Hey!  I found a shortcut through your hedge maze.
Willy: Why you little --
        [thinking] No, no, go easy on the wee one.  His father's going
       to go crazy and chop 'em all into haggis!
 Bart: What's haggis?
Willy: [gasps] Boy...you read my thoughts!  You've got the Shinning.
 Bart: You mean "Shining".
Willy: [sotto voce] Shh!  You want to get sued?
       Now look, boy: if your Dad goes gaga, you just use that...Shin of
       yours to call me and I'll come a running.  But don't be reading
       my mind between four and five.  That's Willy's time!
-- For thinking about haggis, 

Smithers stoops with scissors to cut a wire and picks up two crates of
beer.

   Burns: Yes, by cutting off cable TV and the beer supply, I can ensure
          an honest winter's work out of those low-lives.
Smithers: Sir, did you ever stop to think that [closes car trunk] maybe
          it was doing _this_ that caused the previous caretakers to go
          insane and murder their families?
   Burns: Hmm...perhaps.  Tell you what: we come back and everyone's
          slaughtered, I owe you a Coke.
-- The utmost respect for life, 

The two drive off for the winter.

Inside, Homer sits on the couch, munching greasy heavily-salted snacks.
He grabs the remote control and turns on the TV.

Homer: [changing channels, seeing snow] Hmm.  Cable's out.
        [switch scene to kitchen]
       Think I'll have a beer.  [opens fridge] Hmm.  Not a drop in the
       house.  What do you know.
Marge: Homer, I'm impressed!  You're taking this quite well.
Homer: [crazy] I'll kill you...I'll kill all of you!
Marge: Homer!
Homer: Sorry, sorry.  Don't worry...there's plenty I can do to keep
       myself occupied.  Maybe I'll check out that axe collection.
        [walks out, shuts door, then pops head back in]
        [evil] See you later...
 Lisa: Mom, is Dad going to kill us?
Marge: We're just going to have to wait and see.
-- Cavalier about death, 

Homer sits in the deserted lodge bar.

       [a ghostly Moe materializes behind the bar]
  Moe: So, what'll it be, Homer?
Homer: Moe...gimme a beer!
  Moe: No.  Not unless you kill your family.
Homer: Why should I kill my family?
  Moe: Uh...they'd be much happier as ghosts.
Homer: You don't look so happy.
  Moe: [angry] Oh, I'm happy.  I'm very happy -- la la la, la la la la.
       See?  [grabs Homer] Now waste your family, and I'll give you a
       beer!
-- Not a compelling argument, 

Marge walks into a darkened room calling for her husband.

Marge: Homer?  Homey?  Hmm...[notices typewriter] What he's typed will
       be a window into his madness.
        [reads it] "Feelin' fine".  Woah!  That's a relief.
        [lightning strikes, revealing "No TV and no beer make Homer go
       crazy" scribbled all over the walls]
       Mmm...this is less encouraging --
Homer: [bursting in] Hello!
Marge: Aah!
Homer: So what do you think, Marge?  All I need is a title.  I was
       thinking along the lines of "No TV and No Beer Make Homer"
       something something.
Marge: [timid] "Go Crazy"?
Homer: Don't mind if I do!
-- That wasn't an offer, 

Homer makes crazy noises and faces, then charges Marge.  She runs over
to a glass case enclosing a baseball bat, breaks the glass, and grabs
it, threatening Homer.  "Give me the bat, Marge," he warns, backing her
slowly up some stairs.  She swings it at him as he continues to ask her
for it.  Eventually he laughs and calls her a scaredy-cat, making a
hideous face.  Catching sight of his own hideous face in a mirror causes
him to faint with fright and fall down the stairs, unconscious.

Marge hauls his body into a cold storage room, leaving him there with
"You stay here until you're no longer insane."  Noticing some cans, she
comments, "Hmm...chili would be good tonight."  She walks out, closing
the door behind her.

Homer wakes up and is in heaven, stuffing his face with food.

       [Homer stuffs his face]
  Moe: [through door] Homer?  It's Moe.  Uh, look: some of the ghouls
       and I are a little concerned the project isn't moving forward.
Homer: Can't murder now: eating.
  Moe: Oh, for crying out loud...
-- Homer's one-track mind, 

Moe and some other ghouls come in and drag Homer out against his will.

The rest of the family sit around peacefully eating dinner.  Outside the
door, Homer chops his way in with an axe.

        [Homer chops through door]
 Homer: Heeeere's Johnny!
         [camera pulls back to reveal empty room]
        D'oh!
         [Homer chops through another door]
 Homer: Daaaaavid Letterman!
   Abe: Hi David, I'm Grampa.
 Homer: D'oh!
         [Homer chops through another door]
 Homer: [holding a ticking stopwatch] I'm Mike Wallace, I'm Morley
        Safer, and I'm Ed Bradley.  All this and Andy Rooney tonight on
        "60 Minutes"!
Family: Aah!
-- The Simpsons learn the meaning of "fear", 

They run into a room with a radio.  Marge calls out for help.

 Marge: [into microphone] Hello, police?  This is Marge Simpson.  My
        husband is on a murderous rampage.  Over.
         [shot of Chief Wiggum listening]
Wiggum: [sighs] Well thank God that's over.  I was worried there for a
        second.  [turns off radio]
-- Unfamiliar with radio protocol, 

"No answer," frets Marge.

 Bart: Don't worry, Mom.  I can use my...[looks confused] "Shinning"...
       to call Willy.  [concentrates]
        [Willy watches TV in a little house]
 Kent: And that was the first time she'd ever flown a plane.
Willy: Uh oh.  The little fat boy and his family are in trouble.
        [runs outside, throws TV in the snow] I'm coming to rescue the
       lot of you!
        [opens door to lodge] All right, loony: show me what you got.
        [Homer drives an axe into his back]
       Aw, is that the best you can do?  [collapses]
Marge: Oh, my.  I hope that rug was Scotchgarded.
-- Marge, ever practical, 

Homer drones "Must kill family" and walks towards them menacingly with
the axe.  They run outside into the snow, but Homer gains on them.  As
he raises the axe high above his head to chop, Lisa notices the TV Willy
had thrown in the snow.

 Lisa: Dad, look!  [holds TV up]
Homer: Television!  Teacher, mother, [lusty] secret lover.
       Urge to kill...fading...fading...fading -- rising!  Fading...
       fading
        [family sighs]
       Come, family.  Sit in the snow with Daddy and let us all bask in
       television's warm glowing warming glow.
        [hours later, everyone is frozen]
  Man: [on TV] Live, from Broadway, it's the Tony Awards, with your
       hosts Tyne Daly and Hal Linden!
 Bart: [with difficulty] Homer...change channel!
Homer: Can't!  Frozen!
        [music on TV: "One chorus line of people..."]
       Urge to kill...rising...
-- Enough to make _anyone_ kill, 

[End of Act One.  Time: 8:54]

Second segment title: "Time and Punishment"

It's another beautiful Springfield morning.  Homer waxes philosophical
around the breakfast table.

Homer: You know, Marge, I've had my share of troubles, but sitting here
       now with you and the kids in our cozy home in this beautiful free
       country...it just makes me feel that I'm really a lucky guy.
 Lisa: Dad!  Your hand is jammed in the toaster!
        [everyone screams; Homer runs around]
Homer: Aah!  Get it off!  Get it off!  [slams it into things] Get it off
       of me!
        [throws it off, sighs, slumps down to floor]
 Bart: Dad!  It's in there again!
-- Three times lucky, 

Homer takes the battered toaster down to the basement.

Homer: This shouldn't be too hard to fix...with the right tools.
        [breaks it open with a rock]
-- Homer repairs the family toaster, 

The sun rises the next day as Homer makes final repairs.

      Homer: There...better than new!
              [puts final panel on toaster; inside lights blink]
             Now to take her for a test toast.
              [pops bread in; toaster flashes]
             What the --
              [he grabs it; they both disappear]
              [they fly down a swirly vortex with clocks around them]
             Look at that!  I'm the first non-Brazilian person to travel
             backwards through time.
Mr. Peabody: Correction, Homer: you're the second.
    Sherman: That's right, Mr. Peabody!
Mr. Peabody: Quiet, you.
-- Brazilian?  Huh?, 

Homer arrives in the dinosaur age.

Homer: I've gone back to the time when dinosaurs weren't just confined
       to zoos!
-- 

A pterodactyl flies overhead, and Homer begins to panic.

Homer: Aah!  OK, don't panic -- remember the advice your father gave you
       on your wedding day.
        [remembers Abe with hair and a tuxedo]
  Abe: If you ever travel back in time, don't step on anything because
       even the tiniest change can alter the future in ways you can't
       imagine.
Homer: Fine.  As long as I stand perfectly still and don't touch
       anything, I won't destroy the future.
        [a mosquito flies in]
       Stupid bug!  You go squish now!  [swats it]
-- Touching and swatting are different, 

Homer realizes what he's done.  "But that was just one little
insignificant mosquito.  That can't change the future, right?  Right?"
he asks a passing bearlike creature, who shrugs and grunts "I dunno."
The toast pops and Homer finds himself back in his basement.

 Homer: Phew!  I'm back.  [walks up stairs to kitchen where family eats
        breakfast]
        Aw, my loving family!  Nothing's changed.
         [a buzzer goes off; a TV screen morphs from the floor]
   Ned: [on TV] Heidely-ho, slaverinos!
Family: Okily dokily.
 Homer: Hey, what the hell is that geek Flanders doing on TV?
         [a siren goes off]
   Ned: Oh!  I see by the Big Board we got a Negative Nellie in Sector
        Two.  I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask the whole family to
        kind of freeze and prepare for Re-Neducation.
  Bart: Don't you remember, Dad?  Flanders is the unquestioned lord and
        master of the world.
 Homer: D'oh!
-- Apparently, Homer forgot, 

The house rumbles as a giant flying truck loads it onto itself, secures
it, and flies off into the "Re-Neducation Center".

  Ned: [on a TV] OK, everybody, let's see some biiig smiles!
        [hooks descend on audience, forcing their cheeks apart]
       Just relax and let the hooks do their work.
Homer: [to man next to him] What the hell are you smiling at?
-- Same thing as you, 

Afterwards, Homer massages his cheeks as he stands in a room with many
other men clad in green and pink.

      Ned: [on a TV] Now, in case all that smiling didn't cheer you up,
           there's one thing that never fails: a nice glass of warm
           milk, a little nap -- and a total frontal lobotomy.
      Moe: [slowly] It's not so bad, Homer.  They...go in through your
           nose and...they let you keep the piece of brain they cut out.
           Look!
            [holds up a jar with a piece of brain in it]
           Ooh!  Hello!  Hello there!  Who's that big man there?  Who's
           that?
Bart+Lisa: [droning] Join us, father.
    Marge: [droning] It's bliiiissss...
    Homer: Nooo!
-- How to raise Homer's IQ, 

Homer runs off in a panic as another siren goes off.  Some ferocious
attack dogs are released; they chase him voraciously.

       [Homer gets chased by dogs]
Homer: Oh no, they're gaining on me.  Wait!  I have an idea!
        [reaches into shirt, pulls out wieners]
       These wieners will give me the quick energy I need to escape.
        [eats them, pours on speed]
-- Homer revolts against Re-Neducation, 

"I gotta go back...fix future!" he cries, finding the toaster again and
pushing the handle down.

       [Homer arrives in the past]
Homer: This time I'm not going to touch a thing.
        [a tyrannosaurus rex attacks him]
       Aah!  [hopping away] Mustn't crush...mustn't kill...made it!
        [sits on a fish that walks out of the water]
       Ohh, I wish, I wish I hadn't killed that fish.
-- Homer "Theodore" Simpson, 

The toaster pops and Homer is transported back to the present.

Homer: [walking into empty kitchen] Hey, where is everybody?
        [giant Lisa peeps through window, rips roof off house]
 Bart: Hey...there's a bug that looks like Dad.  Let's kill it!
 Lisa: [gruff] OK.
-- Ask a question..., 

The giant children's fists pound the floor as Homer runs off and
transports back in time again.  He arrives panting, only to have the
tyrannosaur threaten him again -- but this time he sneezes.  The
dinosaur sniffles, then sneezes and collapses.  All the dinosaurs do the
same, dropping dead in a long line.  "This is gonna cost me," Homer
rues.

Arriving back in the present, he notices the layout of the house has
changed for the richer.

Homer: D'oh!  I mean...hey.
 Bart: Good morning, Father dear.  [hands him comics] Hope you're well.
 Lisa: Are we taking the new Lexus to Aunt Patty and Selma's funeral
       today?
Homer: Hmm, fabulous house, well-behaved kids, sisters-in-law dead,
       luxury sedan...woo hoo!  I hit the jackpot.  [sits down] Marge,
       dear, would you kindly pass me a donut?
Marge: Donut?  What's a donut?
Homer: Aah!  Aah!  [pushes toaster handle, disappears]
        [donuts start to fall from the sky]
Marge: Hmm.  It's raining again.
-- Donuts keep falling on my head, 

Homer arrives home again and opens the door to be greeted by Willy.

 Willy: You're still not in your own world, Homer!  I can get you home,
        but you have to do exactly as I -- argh!
         [Maggie axes him]
Maggie: [James Earl Jones voice] This is indeed a disturbing universe.
-- And how, 

In the past, Homer yells angrily, "Don't touch anything?  I'll touch
whatever I feel like!", smashing plants and squishing creatures left and
right.  In the present, his house changes rapidly among an igloo, a
stone house, the original McDonald's, an underwater house, a boot, and a
Bart Sphinx.  The two green aliens watch from their spaceship.

 Kang: Foolish earthling...totally unprepared for the effects of time
       travel.
        [aliens laugh, then change into Sherman and Mr. Peabody]
 Kang: [in Sherman's voice] What happened to us, Kodos?
Kodos: [in Mr. Peabody's voice] Quiet, you.
-- Homer's not the only unprepared one, 

Homer finally arrives back panting and walks slowly up the basement
steps.

Marge: Good morning, dear.
Homer: What's my name?  What color is the sky?  What of donuts?  What?!
       For the love of God, tell me!
Marge: Homer, the sky is blue, donuts are plentiful, Friday is T.G.I.F.
       night on ABC.  What's gotten into you?
Homer: Nothing...nothing at all.  Let's just eat.
        [everyone but Homer eats with long forked tongues]
Homer: Ehh, close enough.
-- A world without cutlery, 

[End of Act Two.  Time: 15:55]

Third segment title: "Nightmare Cafeteria"

The scene opens on Bart's classroom, running amok as usual.  Bart
whistles to get his classmates' attention.

Bart: Hey everybody!  Let's all turn our desks backwards before Mrs.
      Krabappel comes in!
       [everyone agrees vociferously]
Bart: [laughs, looks around] Huh?
       [he's the only one facing backwards]
Edna: All right, backwards boy, back your butt down to detention.
-- Alone in crime, 

Bart walks off sullenly.  He arrives to see the detention room stuffed
full.

Skinner: Over here, Simpson.  The detention room is dangerously
         overcrowded so you'll be serving your time in the cafeteria.
    Kid: [pressed against glass] Oxygen running out --
Skinner: Yes, you should have thought of that _before_ you made that
         paper airplane!
-- No child abuse laws, 

Bart takes his seat next to Jimbo in the crowded cafeteria.

Skinner: This overcrowding in detention is becoming critical.  It's a
         powderkeg waiting to go off in an explosion of unacceptable
         behavior.
  Doris: Don't bitch to me, boss man.  Thanks to the latest budget cuts
         I'm down to using Grade F meat!
Skinner: Wouldn't it be wonderful if there was some sort of common
         solution to both our problems?
  Doris: That would be great.
  Jimbo: Hey Bart, watch this.  [trips Doris]
          [stew splashes] Oh, no!  My favorite outfit.
Skinner: [threatening] Jimbo, this is by far the worst --
          [licks finger, says "Mmm", tries some more]
         -- er, Jimbo, why don't you..._assist_ lunch lady Doris in the
         kitchen?
  Jimbo: Bite me, Skinner.
Skinner: Well might we.
-- Jimbo's meat is higher than grade F?, 

         [behind the closed kitchen door]
  Jimbo: It's hard for me to clean this giant pot when you keep spilling
         meat tenderizer all over me.  [click] Oh, great, now I gotta
         work in the dark.
          [at lunch, Mr. Largo, Miss Hoover, and Mrs. Krabappel eat
         hamburgers]
   Edna: Mmm, mmm, mmm.  This sandwich tastes so young and impudent, heh
         heh.  Seymour, what's with the good grub?
Skinner: Mmm, well perhaps I ought to let you folks in on a secret!  Do
         you remember me telling Jimbo Jones that I would "make
         something of him" one day?
   Edna: [gasps] Are you saying you killed Jimbo, processed his carcass,
         and served him for lunch?
          [Skinner taps his nose]
         Hah!
          [everyone chows down with renewed vigor]
-- Make something of him...literally!, 

Bart gets served a ladleful of some meat dish.

   Bart: Hmm, I wonder where Jimbo is today?  He should have beaten us
         up for our lunch money an hour ago.
   Uter: [cutting in line] Oh, lunch lady?  Please to have another
         sloppy Jimbo?  [to Bart] Das ist gut, nein?  [chomps]
Skinner: Now that's your third helping, young man, making you fat and
         soft...[licks lips] and tender.  Er, you just cut in line,
         didn't you?  Report to detention, Uter.
   Uter: For how long?
Skinner: [quietly] Oh, about seven minutes a pound should do it.
-- That'll take over 700 minutes, 

The next day's lunch is a special Oktoberfest celebration.  Lunch lady
Doris is dressed for the occasion with buns in her hair.

  Doris: OK, I got your German grub right here.
          [serves Bart, who eats, and walks away]
   Lisa: Bart, does it strike you as odd that Uter disappeared and
         suddenly they're serving us this mysterious food called
         "Uterbraten"?
Skinner: [walking up in leiderhosen] Oh, relax, kids, I've got a _gut_
         feeling Uter is around here somewhere.  [chuckles] After all,
         isn't there a little _Uter_ in all of us?  [chuckles] In fact,
         you might even say we just _ate_ Uter and he's in our
         _stomachs_ right now!  [laughs] Wait...scratch that one.
-- A little too literal, 

Lisa and Bart run down stairs that evening in a panic.

     Lisa: Mom!  Mom!  You've gotta help: they're cooking kids in the
           school cafeteria!
    Marge: Listen, kids: you're eight and ten years old now.  I can't be
           fighting all your battles for you.
     Bart: But Mom --
    Marge: No buts!  You march right back to that school, look them
           straight in the eye, and say "Don't eat me"!
Bart+Lisa: [disappointed] OK.
-- A new twist on an old saying, 

A much-fatter Mrs. Krabappel writes "Homework: eat a stick of butter" on
the blackboard.  "Since so many students have been put on permanent
detention," she begins, then burps, "we've merged everyone into a single
class.  I trust there are no objections?"  Bart, Lisa, Milhouse,
Wendell, and Ralph say nothing.  Wendell shivers in fright and his
pencil falls to the floor.  Mrs. Krabappel looks up, points to the hall,
and says, "Detention".  Wendell looks appealingly at Milhouse and Ralph
who look away, and he leaves the class.

Milhouse gasps as he notices Mrs. K reading "The Joy of Cooking
Milhouse".  "Hey, you guys, I was just thinking that any one of us could
be next.  So what do you say we make a break for it?"  The two Simpson
children nod, and the three crawl out of the room.

As they tiptoe down the hall, Bart can't resist looking into the
detention room.  It's now set up with small cages in which children are
given some sort of IV.  Martin looks haggard in his cage and he shakes
convulsively, bringing an admonishment from Skinner: "Easy there, young
man, you'll only make yourself tired and stringy.  Now, to check on the
free-range children," he continues, looking out the window at a pasture
of children running around.

Lunch lady Doris catches the children escaping and she walk towards them
slowly with an eggbeater.

Willy: Hold on, kids!  I'm coming to rescue the lot of you!
        [Skinner appears and axes him]
       Argh!  Oh, I'm bad at this.
-- Groundskeeper Willy, zero for three, 

The children are backed down the hall towards the auditorium.

Skinner: I'm going to enjoy devouring you, Bart Simpson.  Yes...I
         believe I'll start, as you've so often suggested, by eating
         your shorts.
          [Skinner turns a food processor on to "gooify" and backs the
         children towards it]
   Bart: Don't worry, guys.  Something _always_ comes along to save us.
          [Milhouse falls off the edge into the blender]
         Uh, nevertheless I remain confident that something will come
         along and save the two Simpson children...
-- They're needed for continuity, 

Bart wakes up screaming.

Marge: Relax, honey, you were just having a crazy nightmare.  You're
       back with your family now where there's nothing to be afraid
       of...except that fog that turns people out.
 Bart: Huh?
Homer: Uh oh, it's seeping in.  Stupid cheap weatherstripping!
-- The half-assed guide to weatherstripping, 

The family are indeed turned inside out.  The music for "One" begins.

[End of Act Three.  Time: 21:35]

Over the credits, the family sings:

One!  -- chorus line of people, dancing till they make us stop
Too!  -- many dancing people, covered with blood, gore, and glop.
Just one sniff of that fog and you're inside out:
It's worse than that flesh-eating virus you're read about!
Vital organs, they are what we're dressed in,
The family dog is eyeing Bart's intestine.
Happy Hallowe'en!

SLH drags Bart off, devouring him.
 EPISODE TITLE: Bart's Girlfriend


EPISODE SUMMARY: 
[Syndication cuts are marked in curly braces "{}" and are courtesy of
Frederic Briere.]

The scene opens in Veteran's Park where Bart, Lisa, and some other
children crawl along the ground dressed as Indians.  Bart motions his
troupe to stop.

    Lisa: Remember, Bart -- I mean, Dances In Underwear -- we take the
          White Man alive.
    Bart: All right, Thinks Too Much: it shall be so.
           [elsewhere]
Milhouse: Keep your eyes peeled for Injuns -- I mean, Native Americans.
          They're after us because we gave them those blankets infected
          with cooties.
   Ralph: I ate all my caps.  [one explodes] Ouch!
    Bart: [appearing] Throw down your weapons and kiss the prairie,
          Cowdorks!
           [Milhouse, Lewis, Ralph do so]
Milhouse: Oh, why do we have to pay this corny old game anyway?  I
          brought my jacks...[starts playing] [gasps] I got twosies!
           [Nelson appears with a large gun shoots everyone]
    Bart: That's not fair, Nelson.  They didn't have the Killmatic 3000
          back then.
  Nelson: Hey: records from that era are spotty at best.
-- The children play on a Sunday morning, 

He shoots Bart in the head with a ball.  Bart gets up groaning as the
church bell begins to ring.

          Marge: [in the distance] Bart!  Lisa!  Time for church!
Mrs. Van Houten: [in the distance] Milhouse!  Time for church.
     Jewish Man: [in the distance] Shlomo!  Time for your violin lesson!
-- The parents call their children, 

At this last utterance, the children run off frightened into a field of
corn.  All their parents chase after them with various trapping devices.
Bart and Lisa get collared by Marge; Milhouse is caught in a net by his
father on a horse.

On the way to church in the car, Bart feels hardly done by.

   Bart: Why the crap do we have to go to church anyway?
  Marge: You just answered your own question with that commode mouth.
         Besides, you kids need to learn morals and decency and how to
         love your fellow man.
          [in church]
Lovejoy: And with flaming swords, the Aromites did pierce the eyes of
         their fellow men and did feast on what flowed forth.  Among
         whom also we all once conducted ourselves in the lusts of our
         flesh...
-- Mmm, free eye goo, 

Bart, bored to tears by Lovejoy's sermon, pulls out a troll doll with
large blue hair and begins to paraphrase "I'm a Soul Man", substituting
"troll" for "soul".  Marge grabs the doll away from him: "I don't want
you playing with something that has such bizarre hair.  Awful, awful
hair."

Much later, Bart continues to be bored.

   Lovejoy: And now my daughter Jessica, who has just returned from
            boarding school, will read the same passage I just read.  I
            noticed a few of you weren't paying attention.
      Bart: [groans] Oh...
             [Jessica walks up; a heavenly light shines upon her]
      Bart: [gasps] Wow!  There _is_ a God!
             [the light comes from a lighthouse outside]
       Man: I'm telling you the light would work better if it pointed
            out to sea.
McAllister: Arr, shut up!  I know what I'm doing.
             [a boat crashes in the distance]
            Arr, I hate the sea and everything in it.
-- Blanket statements, 

After the service, Mrs. Lovejoy sees the attendees out.

Mrs. Lovejoy: Bye.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Thank you for choosing our
              church.  Bye-bye.
        Bart: [looking at Jessica] I've never felt this way about a girl
              before.  My long search is finally over.
               [gulps, walks over, clears throat]
               [Jessica turns and smiles]
              Hi, I'm Bart Simpson.  I was incredibly moved by your
              reading.  I don't think God's words have _ever_ sounded so
              plausible.
     Jessica: Thanks, Art.  Um, I have to go over here now.
               [turns away, stands there]
-- Oh, the humanity, 

Bart is crushed.  He lies face down on Lisa's floor.

Lisa: Don't be so hard on yourself, Bart.  It's not your fault Jessica
      doesn't like you.
Bart: Is it my hair?  My overbite?  The fact that I've worn the same
      clothes day in, day out for the last four years?
Lisa: No, Bart.  I just think you and Jessica are too different from
      each other to get along.  She's a sweet, kind reverend's daughter
      and you're the devil's cabana boy.
-- Bart laments Jessica's brush-off, 

The next week at church, Bart walks slowly towards the Sunday school
room and enters.

Teacher: [watching children draw] Good!  Very good!  Ralph, Jesus did
         not have wheels.
          [sees Bart, gasps] Bart Simpson?
   Bart: Yes, ma'am.  I'd like to return to your wonderful Sunday
         school, please.
Teacher: [nervous] Uh, but Bart, we banned you from Sunday school.  You
         were happy, we were happy, everybody was happy -- particularly
         the hamster.
          [the hamster sees Bart and cowers]
-- The hamster _is_ smarter, after all, 

   Bart: I've changed my ways.  _Please_ give me another chance, ma'am.
Teacher: All right, Bart.  The Bible _does_ teach forgiveness.  Class, I
         want you to welcome back our prodigal son.
          [children look at each other: "What's prodigal mean?"]
         Oh, dear.
-- Bart gets back into Sunday school, 

Bart takes a seat next to Jessica.

   Bart: You know, the great thing about Sunday school is we're finally
         learning something we can use.
Jessica: Yah, so true.  I have to turn my chair this way now.
-- Snubbed again, 

   Bart: Somehow I gotta convince her I'm a good person!  All right, I
         have to sit here and behave no matter what.
Teacher: OK, class, we have a special treat today for pass-around: a
         replica of the slingshot David used to slay Goliath.  While you
         kids are looking at that, I'll just busy myself in this file
         cabinet.
          [bends over]
-- The worst temptation, 

Jessica looks at it dully, then hands it to Bart.  Reflexively, his
hands load the slingshot and pull the elastic back, ready to fire it
straight at the teacher.

   Bart: Must...fight...Satan...make it...up to him...later!
          [manages to resist, sighs]
         You know, I was considering staying after school and helping
         teacher clean up.
Jessica: [yawns] Do you ever think anything you _don't_ say?
-- Three snubs lucky, 

After class, the children escape joyously.  Bart watches from afar as
the teacher talks to Jessica.

 Bart: There is just no pleasing a girl like that!  [musses hair] All
       that unnecessary behaving...[smears dirt on himself] I'm all
       tense through the chestal area!  I need relief.
        [sees "Scotchtoberfest" sign and Willy playing the bagpipes]
Willy: Now the kilt was only for day-to-day wear.  In battle, we donned
       a full-length ball gown covered in sequins.  The idea was to
       blind your opponent with luxury.
        [Bart ties balloons to his kilt; it lifts to reveal his shame]
Willy: [seeing people look away] Ach!  'Tis no more than what God gave
       me, you puritan pukes!
-- Bart lets loose, 

   Bart: [laughs] That'll hold me.  At least until I get my hands on
         some kind of explosives.
          [a tree grabs him; police with guns pop up from everywhere]
Skinner: Congratulations, Simpson.  You just fell for our sting and won
         yourself three months' detention.  There's no such thing as
         "Scotchtoberfest".
  Willy: There's not?  You used me, Skinner!  You used me!
-- The best-laid plans, 

Bart can't believe it..."Three months?!  Oh..."

Jessica: Hi, Bart.  I saw the way they set you up.  That was really
         unfair!
   Bart: [groans] Oh...
Jessica: Want to have dinner at my house tonight?
   Bart: Really?  Uh, sure...
Jessica: Great.  [giggles] We eat at 7:00.  [walks off]
   Bart: There's only on thing to do at a moment like this: strut.
          ["Stayin' Alive" starts playing]
-- You can tell by the way he uses his walk..., 

[End of Act One.  Time: 7:01]

{Bart grooms himself for his big dinner date.  His parents watch proudly
at the bathroom door.}

Homer: {I can't believe my little boy is already going on his first
       date.
        [sings] Sunrise, sunset, sunrise, sunset...
       Cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon...
       Yes, we have no bananas...[weeps]}
Marge: {Oh, that's sweet Homer.  Our son _is_ growing up, isn't he.}
Homer: {No, it's not that.  Didn't you hear?  They have no bananas!
       They have no bananas today...[walks off crying]}
-- Bart comes of age, 

Jessica and her parents sit down with Bart for dinner.

Mrs. Lovejoy: So, Bart, how's school going?  Jessica always gets
              straight A's.
        Bart: Well, in _my_ family grades aren't that important.  It's
              what you _learn_ that counts.
Rev. Lovejoy: Six times five, what is it?
        Bart: Um...
-- So he hasn't learned his times tables, 

        Bart: Actually, numbers don't have much use in my future career:
              Olympic gold medal rocket sled champion!
Mrs. Lovejoy: Hmm.  I didn't know the rocket sled was an Olympic event.
        Bart: Well, no offense, lady, but what you don't know could fill
              a warehouse.
               [gasps from the adults]
Rev. Lovejoy: Young man, explain yourself!
        Bart: Sorry.  I have a kind of a short fuse...which some find
              charming!  Speaking of charming, watching Fox last night,
              I heard a rather amusing story.  This character named
              Martin was feeling rather...randy, and he was heard to
              remark --
               [scene cut to Bart being kicked out]
Rev. Lovejoy: Don't you _ever_ come near my daughter again!  Never have
              I heard such gratuitous use of the word "butt"!
        Bart: But -- but -- but --
Mrs. Lovejoy: [plugging her ears] Make him stop, make him stop!
-- The dinner date goes awry, 

Bart sits on the sidewalk, dejected.

Jessica: [walking up] You're _bad_, Bart Simpson.
   Bart: [plaintive] No I'm not!  I'm really --
Jessica: Yes you are.  You're bad...and I like it.
   Bart: [suave] I'm bad to the bone, honey.
Jessica: Let's go find some fun.
   Bart: But your father said --
Jessica: [scoffs] I told the _Rev_ I was going to my room to say my
         prayers.
   Bart: Smart, beautiful..._and_ a liar!  So much better than that
         Sarah, plain and tall.
          [a weeping Sarah runs away]
-- 

The two children go and loiter under a "No Loitering" sign, then go and
eat ice cream right in front of a weight loss center to torture the
exercisers inside.  Lastly, they decorate the statue of Jebediah
Springfield with toilet paper.

Bart: Excellent!  You're incredible, Jessica: your throws, your catches,
      your spirals, and your loops -- it's like the toilet paper is an
      extension of your body.
-- Bart and Jessica decorate a statue, 

Next day at school, Bart brags about his conquest to his friends.

Milhouse: No way would a minister's daughter go out with _you_.
    Bart: Oh yeah?  I'll prove it.
           [walks over] Hey, Jessica!
 Jessica: Yes?  Am I supposed to know you?
    Bart: Jessica, we just -- oof!  [Nelson belts him]
  Nelson: That's for besmirching an innocent girl's name!
-- Nelson, honor-bound, 

Bart sits on the ground, doubled over.

   Bart: [in pain] Why?
Jessica: I'm sorry, Bart.  You know my parents can't find out about us.
         And besides, if it's secret, it's even more exciting...
   Bart: I guess...
Jessica: Hey, you want to go skateboarding?
   Bart: Actually, I was hoping I could sit down for just a second.
Jessica: [cajoling] Come on!  It'll be fun.
          [looks around, then kisses Bart]
   Bart: Wow!  [stands up] Now I have the energy to do anything!
         [doubles over again] Just give me two minutes.
-- Bart deals with Nelson's punch, 

The two go to the top of an impossibly steep and enormous hill.

   Bart: Jessica, I think this is too steep.
Jessica: Bart, you can't trust your perception at this altitude.
         [pushes him]
-- The children go skateboarding, 

Bart struggles to keep his balance as Jessica starts her own descent
amidst laughter.  "Actually," notes Bart, "if the road surface maintains
its integrity, I just might be able to hold on --" An oil truck crashed
at the side of the road leaks its contents and Bart barely manages to
stay on.  He sighs with relief, only to run into a field of ball
bearings.  He manages to avoid disaster here too.

As he comes over the next hill, he sees a crashed glue truck.  "Oh," he
sighs, "the glue will slow me down."  Two men stand next to the truck.
"Is the glue leaking?" one asks, and the other answers, "Naw, that glue
ain't going nowhere."  Bart laments, "Oh, nothing's ever going to stop
me!"...but he didn't count on an ant carrying an almond across the road
with its huge strength.  Seeing Bart approaching, it drops the almond in
a panic and runs off.  Bart's wheel catches on the almond, and he and
his skateboard bounce down the hill.

He looks up woozily at the bottom, only to hear, "Oh no!  There goes the
glue after all!"  It covers him in a great white flood.  Jessica pulls
up near him laughing and asks, "Fun, huh?"  Bart can only bubble.

Bart walks past the kitchen table with Snowball II stuck to his back.

Marge: Have you noticed any change in Bart?
Homer: New glasses?
Marge: No...he looks like something might be disturbing him.
Homer: Probably misses his old glasses.
Marge: I guess we could get more involved in Bart's activities but then
       I'd be afraid of smothering him.
Homer: Yeah, and then we'd get the chair.
Marge: That's not what I meant.
Homer: It was, Marge, admit it.
-- Marge's secret death-wish, 

The next day at school, the bell for classes rings as Bart walks to
class.  Jessica jumps out in front of him.

Jessica: Hi.
   Bart: Uh, we should get to class.
Jessica: What's the hurry?
   Bart: We could get in trouble for being late.
Jessica: Aw, you worry too much.  Come on, if you stay here a while I'll
         let you hold my hand.
          [she grabs his hand, then uses it to pull the fire alarm]
          [laughs] Teamwork!  Come on, Bart.
          [everyone rushes out in a panic]
  Willy: If I don't save the wee turtles, who will?!
          [kicks down door, comes out covered in turtles]
         Aah!  Save me from the wee turtles!  They were too quick for
         me!
-- Willy, noble in pain, 

Bart tells Lisa what happened.

 Lisa: I can't believe it, Bart.  I'd always thought Jessica was so
       sweet!
 Bart: She's like a Milk Dud, Lis: sweet on the outside, poison on the
       inside.
 Lisa: You gotta give her up.
 Bart: No no, wait: hear my plan.  Put up with her for seven more years,
       then we'll get married.  Once the first baby comes along she's
       bound to settle down and start treating me right.  After all, I
       deserve it.
 Lisa: Bart, it's naive to think you can change a person...except maybe
       that boy who works in the library...
        [flashback to library]
Ralph: Do you have, "Go, Dog, Go"?
  Boy: [scoffs] That's in Juvenile.  This is Young Adult.
        [back to present] Well-read, and just a little wild.  [dreamy]
       Ooh, if only someone could tame him...
 Bart: You're right, Lisa: love isn't about _fixing_ someone.  I'm just
       going to give her up cold turkey.  I'm not going to talk to her
       or see her -- it's over.  Thanks for the advice, sis.
 Lisa: [sighs wistfully]
-- Those library workers are the wildest, 

Bart crosses off the days on his calendar, starting April 1st and
continuing until June 30th.

 Bart: There.  If I can just get through this many days without seeing
       her she should be completely out of my system.  OK: day one.
       [circles it]
Marge: Time for church, Bart!  I bet your little friend Jessica will be
       there.
 Bart: D'oh!
-- 

As the family walk up to church, "Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring" plays on
the organ.  A beautiful woman's voice rises above the playing.

Bart: [hears singing] Jessica!
Lisa: Bart, be strong!  You don't need that little hellcat.
Bart: Oh, Lis: she's already drawing me to her with her beautiful siren
      song.
       [opens church door, sees Ned Flanders singing falsetto]
       [shudders] That's _very_ disturbing.
-- But hardly surprising, 

A hand reaches out and grabs Bart.

Jessica: Hey, Bart.
          [Bart looks away]
         What?  What's wrong?
   Bart: Well, Jessica...I don't think we should hang out together any
         more.  You're turning me into a criminal when all I want to be
         is a petty thug.
  Homer: Oh, good.  Here comes the collection plate!
          [puts a coupon inside]
  Marge: [reading it] "30 cents off Shake'N'Bake"...Homer!
  Homer: We can spare it, Marge!  We've been blessed.
-- Shake'N'Bake don't pay the bills, 

Jessica acts despondent.

Jessica: You're right about everything, Bart.  [sighs] I have been too
         reckless.  From now on, I am going to settle down.
          [dumps collection plate money into her purse]
   Bart: [gasps] Jessica!  What are you doing?
Jessica: Well, it takes money to start a new life.
   Bart: Stealing from the collection basket is really wrong!  Even _I_
         know that.
Jessica: Fine.  You just lost your cut.
-- Partners in crime, 

Mrs. Lovejoy: I'll just take that -- [sees empty collection plate]
               [gasps] Everyone turn around and look at this!
         Abe: What is it?  A Unitarian?
               [everyone surrounds Bart]
        Bart: [thinking] Now just relax.  For once, you didn't do
              anything wrong.  Just explain yourself and everyone will
              understand.
               [aloud] I --
Mrs. Lovejoy: -- took the money?  Yes, we know.
         Moe: He confessed!
        Bart: OK!  [jumps out window]
       Homer: [after a delay] Stop him!  He's headed for the window!
-- Closing the barn door too late, 

[End of Act Two.  Time: 15:50]

Homer and Marge have a talk with Bart at home.

Homer: Son, if you can look me in the eye and say you didn't take the
       collection money, that's all I need.
 Bart: [looking at him] I didn't take it.
Homer: Why you little -- [strangles him] How can you look me in the eye
       and lie like that?
Marge: Homer, stop it!  I believe him.
Homer: Tell me: if he didn't take the money, why is he wearing those
       fancy clothes?
Marge: [sighs] That's what he wore to church.
Homer: Oh, how convenient!
Marge: Bart, honey, do you know who _did_ take the money?
 Bart: [pause] No.
Homer: See, son?  Telling the truth isn't so bad.
-- Black is white, 

Bart walks outside, only to be booed by everyone.  People driving by
yell, "Crook!"  "Thief!"  "Steal the money from the church collection
plate!"

Jessica, meanwhile, plays with a baton.

   Bart: We gotta talk.
Jessica: Listen, thanks for not turning me in.  That was sweet.
   Bart: Well, it seems like if you really care for me, you should come
         forward.
Jessica: Oh, don't you see?  It's because I care for you that I _can't_
         come forward.
   Bart: [thinks] That doesn't make any sense.
Jessica: [petulant] All right, then I just don't feel like it, OK?
   Bart: Jessica, you're really beautiful, but _you_ are not very nice.
Jessica: [sighs contemptulously] Duh.
   Bart: You know, with the way you're treating me, why _should_ I
         protect you?
Jessica: Because, if you tell, no one will believe you.  Remember I'm
         the sweet, perfect minister's daughter...and you're just yellow
         trash.
-- Meta-humor galore, 

Bart thinks on things dejectedly in his treehouse.  Lisa climbs up to
see him.

  Lisa: [entering treehouse] So here's where you're hiding!
  Bart: Yeah.  This is my only refuge from the taunts and accusations of
        the townspeople.
Jasper: [appearing at window] Thief!
         [Bart pulls the blind]
  Lisa: Bart, we can't just let her get away with this.
  Bart: Give it up, Lis: she's a criminal mastermind.  She's got 108 IQ,
        she reads at a fifth grade level, and...[sighs] her hair smells
        like red Froot Loops.
  Lisa: [threatening] Yeah?  Well I eat Froot Loops for breakfast.
-- A dire threat, 

The next Sunday at church, Rev. Lovejoy has taken steps.

Lovejoy: Because of last week's problems, we'll be taking certain
         precautions with this week's collection.
  Marge: We really shouldn't have let them do this; it can't be helping
         his self-esteem.
          [Bart is in a Hannibal Lecter-type contraption]
-- Kids are resilient, however, 

Lovejoy: Now, for our offertory reading, Lisa Simpson -- who we'll all
         be keeping an eye on.
   Lisa: I know most of you have already judged my brother guilty
         without any proof, but doesn't the Bible teach us, "Judge not,
         lest ye be judged," Reverend?
Lovejoy: [sullen] I think it may be somewhere towards the back.
-- Bible knowledge just like a minister should have, 

   Lisa: There is someone among us with a guilty conscience.  After much
         soul-searching I decided it would be wrong of me to name names.
         But I urge that guilty person here, under the eyes of God, to
         come forward -- to confess, and save yourself from the torment
         of your own personal hell!
Skinner: Aah!  I smelled some marijuana smoke in Vietnam!
    Abe: I was the one who canceled "Star Trek"!
Hibbert: I left my Porsche keys inside Mrs. Glick!
   Lisa: I am talking to the collection money thief!  Only you can come
         forward and end this injustice.
          [Jessica looks around, smiling and saying nothing]
         Oh, what the heck: it was Jessica Lovejoy!
-- So much for not naming names, 

Lisa entreats everyone to search Jessica's room.  "To the little girl's
room!" cries Homer, and off everyone goes.

Moe uses a jack to lift up her mattress, revealing the money.

Skinner: _That's_ the collection money!
    Moe: [sniffs it] Oh yeah, smells like church.
Lovejoy: I guess it's obvious what's happened here.  Bart Simpson has
         somehow managed to sneak his bedroom into my house.
          [everyone looks at him]
         Well, come on!  Use your imaginations!
Jessica: No, Dad.  _I_ did it: it's your classic cry for attention.
Lovejoy: Well, young lady, I suppose we brought you home from boarding
         school a little prematurely.
Jessica: I was _expelled_, Dad!  Remember the pipe bomb, the Glee Club
         brawl?  Remember the school _chapel_ collection plate?
          [Lovejoy starts singing "Bringing in the Sheaves"]
         Exploding toilets ring a bell?  Come on, Dad!  Pay attention to
         me!  We're going there...
-- The truth comes out, 

"I think you all owe my son an apology," says Marge to the assembled
group.  Everyone files past the ensconced boy, grumbling their
apologies.

Jessica scrubs the church steps as Bart skateboards up to her.

   Bart: Hi Jessica.
Jessica: Hi Bart.  Come to watch me suffer?
   Bart: I just wanted to let you know that even though this was a
         difficult experience, I really learned a lot.  I'm a little
         wiser, and a little less naive.
Jessica: [coquettish] Well, I learned that I can make men do whatever I
         want.
   Bart: Well...don't you see, Jessica, then you really haven't learned
         --
Jessica: Um, would you finish scrubbing these steps with me?
   Bart: [enthusiastic] _Will_ I?
    Boy: [riding up on bike] Hey, Jessica!
Jessica: Coming!  [runs over to him; they ride off]
   Bart: Poor sucker.  It's amazing what some guys will do for a pretty
         face!  Not me, though.  [sly] Wait till she sees the second-
         rate job I do on these stairs.  [laughs to himself]
-- A different kind of revenge, 

[End of Act Three.  Time: 20:50]
 EPISODE TITLE: Lisa on Ice


EPISODE SUMMARY: 
[Syndication cuts are marked in curly braces "{}" and are courtesy of
Ricardo Lafaurie and Frederic Briere.]

Everyone but Marge sits in front of the TV.

 Announcer: It's "Channel Six Action News."
             [several explosions are shown]
      Bart: Ah, Action News.  The last place an impressionable kid can
            go for TV violence.
 Announcer: And now, here's your Action Anchor[tm], Kent Brockman.
      Kent: [jumping in, panting] Hello, I'm Kent Brockman!  Our top
            stories tonight: a tremendous _explosion_ in the price of
            lumber, President Reagan _dyes_...his hair, plus Garry
            Trudeau and his new musical comedy revue.  But first!  Let's
            check the death count from the killer storm bearing down on
            us like a shotgun full of snow.
Weatherman: Well, Kent, as of now the death count is zero.  But it _is_
            ready to shoot right up.
      Kent: Oh my God.  [shakes fist at heaven] Damn you snow!
-- Doing what's needed for ratings, 

Bart is jubilant upon hearing of the snowstorm.

      Bart: All right!  Snow day.  No school tomorrow!  [throws his
            schoolbook on the fire]
      Lisa: That doesn't mean you don't have to do your book report.
            What if the weatherman is wrong?
      Bart: Lisa, that man is a professional meteorologist.
Weatherman: Kent, I'd like to remind everybody to come down and watch me
            at the Springfield Laff'N'Brew, and burgers and fries this
            Saturday.  The forecast calls for a 75% chance of hilarity!
     Homer: I like those odds...
-- Professional barbequer too, 

The next morning at seven o'clock, Bart sleeps peacefully in bed when
Lisa throws open his door and yells "Snowball fight!"  Bart wakes up
groggily, only to be pounded in the face with a ball of snow.  Lisa
chuckles unkindly, then takes off with Bart in hot pursuit.  She runs
out the front door.

 Bart: You're going to eat a blizzard of...[looks around] unseasonable
       warmth?
 Lisa: I made the snowball from the frost in our freezer!  [laughs]
        [all the other kids around laugh]
Jimbo: Nice PJs, Simpson.  Did your mommy buy 'em for ya?
 Bart: Of course she did.  Who else would have?
Jimbo: [thinks] [menacing] All right, Simpson, you win _this_ round.
-- I know you are, but what am I?, 

No snow day, indeed.  Bart sits in class and frets about his unfinished
book report.

   Edna: OK, it's book report time.  We'll do them alphabetically.
         Today it's A through M.
   Bart: I'm saved!  I love being a S-s-s-s-simpson.
   Edna: Let's see, we have no A's, so let's go right to the B's.  Bart?
   Bart: Huh?
   Edna: Hah!
   Bart: [slowly] Mrs. Krabappel, I didn't --
Skinner: [over PA] Attention, this is Principal Skinner, your principal,
         with a message from the Principal's Office.  All students
         please proceed immediately to an assembly in the Butthead
         Memorial Auditorium.  [to himself] Dammit, I wish we hadn't let
         the students name that one.
-- Memorial?  Butthead's dead?, 

In the auditorium, Skinner speaks to the children.

Skinner: Children, the times they are a-becoming quite different.  Test
         scores are at an all-time low, so I've come up with these
         academic alerts.  [hold stack of cards] You will receive one as
         soon as your grades start to slip in any subject.  This way
         your parents won't have to wait until report card time to
         punish you.
 Martin: How innovative.  I like it!
Kearney: Hey Dolph, take a memo on your Newton: beat up Martin.
          [Dolph writes "Beat up Martin" which the Newton translates as
         "Eat up Martha"]
         Bah!  [throws Newton]
 Martin: [being bonked on the head] Ow!
-- Good ol' Apple Computer, 

Skinner: All right, first academic alert: Wiggum, Ralph.
  Ralph: I won, I won!  [walks on stage]
Skinner: No no, Ralph, this means you're failing English.
  Ralph: Me fail English?  That's unpossible!
Skinner: Mundt, Nelson, you're failing History, Geography, and Math,
         but, er, you're doing quite well in Home Ec.
 Nelson: Hey, keep it down, man.  [uncomfortable] Ha ha.
Skinner: Simpson --
          [Bart gulps]
         -- Lisa.
   Lisa: [walking up] Grades are all I have!  What could I be failing?
         I'm smart and a teacher's pet.
          [gets card, reads it] Gym?!  That's the stupidest thing I ever
         heard!
          [balls up card, throws it towards garbage can, misses]
-- Well, failing basketball, anyway, 

At home, Homer signs one of the academic alerts.

Marge: Lisa, your father and I are very concerned about this warning.  I
       really hope you try harder.
Homer: Whew!  That's all of 'em.  [puts stack in front of Bart] And I'm
       so proud you didn't try to forge my name.  How about a present,
       son?
 Bart: Well, I _could_ use a new pair of hockey skates.
Homer: Done and done.
 Lisa: That's not fair.  Why is Bart getting a present and I'm getting
       chewed out?
Homer: [sitting back] Ah, the mysteries of life.
-- Homerian philosophy, 

Lisa asks her gym teacher what to do.

Teacher: Tell you what, Simpson: I won't fail you if you join one of
         those peewee teams outside the school.
   Lisa: You mean those leagues where parents push their kids into
         vicious competition to compensate for their own failed dreams
         of glory?
Teacher: Look, I don't need this.  I inhaled my favorite whistle this
         morning!
-- Lisa talks to her gym teacher, 

So Lisa attends tryouts at the Springfield Youth Center.  At the
basketball tryouts, the other children manage to dribble with their
hands, yet Lisa can only do it with her forehead.  At the volleyball
tryouts, someone serves to Lisa and she raises her arms to bump it, but
it lands on a spike of her hair and deflates.  The coach walks out and
mourns, "Children, that was our only ball.  They'll be no team this
year."

Lisa is despondent at home.

 Lisa: [sobs] Mom, this is really scary.  I'm going to get my first F
       ever.
Marge: Cheer up!  So you're not good at sports: it's a very small part
       of life.
Homer: [walking in, humming] Sports, sports, sports, sports, sports,
       sports, sports, sports...Marge, Bart rides up in the front seat
       today because he's a good guy at sports.
Marge: [whispering] I think Lisa needs to feel a little special tonight.
       How about letting her ride up front too?
        [Homer looks at Bart, who shakes his head]
Homer: Ehh, I tried.
-- Not very hard, as usual, 

In the car, on the way to the hockey arena, Bart sits in the front while
Marge, Maggie, and Lisa are relegated to the back.

Homer: OK son, just remember to have fun out there today.  And if you
       lose, I'll kill you!
        [everyone laughs]
 Bart: [good-humored] Oh, Dad.
Homer: [looks menacingly at Bart]
 Bart: [cringes]
-- 

Chief Wiggum, coach of Bart's team (the Mighty Pigs), incites his team
to beat the Kwik-E-Mart Gougers coached by Apu.  Milhouse plays goal for
the Gougers, his glasses on outside his mask.  "I could have been
equipment manager, but no..." he laments angrily.  Bart stickhandles
flashily towards him, then winds up and takes a slapshot.  It hits
Milhouse's mask right between the eyes, knocking him over.

Apu helps Milhouse up, but the poor boy seems unconscious.  "Our goalie
cannot stand up," Apu muses, then calls, "Tell you what: get some rope."
Milhouse is tied spreadeagled to the goalposts; he looks up briefly,
only to have his head slump over again.

A Pigs player slaps the puck down to the other end of the rink and a
giant pile-up ensues.  The puck breaks free and slides slowly down the
ice, straight towards Milhouse.  He blows at it feebly to impede its
progress as Apu calls, "Defense, defense!  Come on, you call that
blowing?"  But Milhouse can only watch helplessly as it slides under him
into the goal.  The referee blows his whistle just as the buzzer goes
with the score now 3-2.  "Oh yes!" cries Wiggum, "We won!  We won!  Um,
unfortunately, because I bet on the other team, heh, we won't be going
for pizza."  His team sighs.

Homer: Well, boy, you won.  So I'm going to live up to my side of the
       agreement: here's your turtle, alive and well.
 Bart: [taking it] Aw, thanks, Dad.  [they hug] How about some adulation
       from my little sister?
 Lisa: Wow, Bart, I'm so impressed you were able to give Milhouse a
       concussion.
-- He didn't ask for _sincere_ adulation, 

Bart gets angry and positions himself in front of some garbage on the
floor.  "Aw, you're just jealous because you!  Stink!  At!  Sports!" he
tells Lisa, punctuating his speech with slapshots of garbage at her.
She blocks them all, yelling "Quit it, Bart!"  A can flies off and hits
Apu in the head, whereupon he turns around and sees Lisa fending off
Bart's attack.  "Ooh, you know I wonder...if her skills would transfer
over to the game of hockey.  Well, only one way to be sure."  He throws
a puck down on the ice and calls, "Heads up, little girl!" slapping it
at her.  She screams and ducks, catching it in one hand.  She looks at
it disbelievingly.

Apu runs towards her joyously: "The goalie of my dreams!"  He hugs her
and says, "Let's try a hard one to make sure it wasn't a fluke.  He goes
back and hits another puck at her which she bats away with a stick.  It
hits Milhouse who cries, "Hey!  Way to knock out my teeth."  Apu
encourages him, "Yeah, that's it, Milhouse, keep up the chatter."

[End of Act One.  Time: 7:11]

At dinner Homer feels the need to comment on Lisa's hockey talent.

Homer: Lisa, if the Bible has taught us nothing else -- and it hasn't --
       it's that girls should stick to girls' sports, such as hot-oil
       wrestling, foxy boxing, and such-and-such.
Marge: I think women should be able to play any sport men play, but
       hockey is so violent and dangerous -- look at Milhouse's teeth.
        [open her hand]
 Bart: Mom, will you stop showing us those?
-- Marge's darker side, 

    Lisa: I _have_ to join the team or I'll get an F that will haunt me
          for the rest of my life.
           [in the future, Lisa is being sworn in]
     Man: I now pronounce you President of these United --
Reporter: Stop the inauguration!  I just discovered our President Elect
          got an F in second grade gym class!
           [crows gasps; Lisa is handcuffed]
     Man: In that case I sentence you to a lifetime of horror on Monster
          Island.  [to Lisa] Don't worry, it's just a name.
           [Lisa and others are chased by fire-breathing monsters]
    Lisa: He said it was just a name!
     Man: What he meant is that Monster Island is actually a peninsula.
-- Lisa's future, 

Milhouse knocks on the door with a dentist and asks, "Do you have my
teef?"  Everyone looks at Marge, who closes her fist around them and
says, "No..."

At the next hockey game, Homer walks into the dressing room with Lisa to
lay down some rules.

Homer: OK, hotshots, now that my daughter is on your team, I want to
       make a few things clear.
 Lisa: [embarrassed] Please, Dad, I'll be fine
Homer: [makes negative mumbling noises at Lisa] I don't want anyone to
       give her a hard time just because she's different: no jokes, no
       taunting -- [spots Uter]
        [guffaws] Look, that kid's got bosoms!  Who's got a wet towel?
        [chases Uter, laughing] Come here, you butterball.
 Uter: [screams] Don't make me run, I'm full of chocolate!
-- Uter and the chocolate explosion, 

During the game, at first Lisa feels unsure of herself and afraid of the
puck.  Rather than stopping the puck to help her team, she fends it off
as though frightened, which accomplishes the same effect.

       [Homer and Bart laugh]
Marge: [covering her eyes] I can't even watch.  I don't know how you two
       can sit her laughing at poor Lisa while she's out there probably
       scared to death.
Homer: We're laughing _with_ her, Marge.  There's a big difference.
 Lisa: [off-camera] Aah!
        [Homer and Bart burst out laughing again]
        [Marge looks disapprovingly at Homer]
Homer: [to Marge, quickly] With her.
-- Lisa's first hockey game, 

Lisa looks for some praise after the game.

 Lisa: You really think I did OK out there, Mom?
Marge: Absolutely, honey.  By blocking the net, I really think you
       helped your team.
-- Marge's trenchant insight, 

Homer drives the car around to get the family.

Homer: OK, little buddy: hop in!
        [Bart steps forward]
       Ah bah!  I mean my little _girl_ buddy.
 Lisa: That's very nice, Dad, but it's wrong for you to reward violent
       competitive behavior.  However, I _will_ sit up front with you if
       it's a fatherly gesture of love.
Homer: [kindly] OK, hon.  [she gets in]
       Sucker!  Competitive violence, that's why you're here!  [laughs]
-- Such a devious ruse, 

Lisa eventually learns to trade her fear of the puck for anger.  Whereas
she once stopped the puck out of fear, she now does so with verve,
growling fiercely.  At a team party, Apu reflects on the season.

     Apu: We're having our best season ever.  And I would like to say
          that it is because of teamwork...gee, who am I kidding, huh?
          It's all because of Lisa.
 Kearney: Let's hear it for Lisa!
           [Bart looks sullen]
Milhouse: Hey Bart, if Lisa's better than you at hockey, does that mean
          you're going to become better than her at school?
    Bart: [gasps] Maybe I will, Milhouse.  Maybe I will.
           [in class, Bart grins and puts up his hand]
    Edna: Who can tell me the capital of Spain?  Bart Simpson?
    Edna: [later] The square root of 36?  Bart Simpson?
    Edna: [later] Who freed the slaves?  Bart Simpson?
    Edna: [later] Bart Simpson?
    Edna: [later] Bart Simpson?
    Edna: [later] Bart Simpson, will you stop raising your hand?  You
          haven't had one right answer all day.
    Bart: Sorry.
-- A for effort, however, 

          [Jimbo and Kearney restrain Bart]
  Nelson: [beating on Bart] This is for wasting teacher's valuable time!
    Lisa: [punches Jimbo, pulls his shirt half over his head]
          Lay off, guys!  He's with me.
           [Kearney and Nelson back away]
   Jimbo: [points at Bart] It's a lucky coincidence you happen to be
          your sister's brother.
    Lisa: Don't worry, Bart, they won't bother you any more.
           [everyone points and laughs]
 Skinner: I hardly ever let Mother fight for me any more!  [laughs]
Milhouse: Sorry, Bart, I'm going to hang out with Lisa...for
          protection..._and_ to be seen!
-- The new Simpson pants-wearer, 

At home, Homer looks in the fridge.

 Bart: Come watch TV with me, Dad.  We missed the first two episodes of
       "Cops", but if we hurry we can catch the last three.
Homer: Aw, sorry Bart, Lisa and I are going out for a gelato.  We'd ask
       you to come, but...you know.
 Bart: Oh.
Marge: Bart, _I_ can spend some time with you.
 Bart: I don't know, Mom.
Marge: Don't have a stereotypical view of me just because I'm your
       mother.  I know: how about we play the basketball?  I'm no Harvey
       Globetrotter, but --
 Bart: Ohh...
       {[outside, Marge dribbles with two hands]}
Marge: {Watch out for the Shaq attaq!
        [throws the ball at Bart's face]}
 Bart: {Ow!}
Marge: {I told you to watch out...}
-- Marge O'Neal, 

Lisa becomes ever more bestial on ice.

 Lisa: Milhouse!  Knock him down if he's in your way.
       Jimbo!  Jimbo, go for the face!
       Look!  Ralph Wiggum lost his shin guard.  Hack the bone!  Hack
       the bone!
Homer: Wow...eye of the tiger, mouth of a Teamster!  Just think of all
       the time I've wasted on _you_!  [points at Bart]
        [realizing] Er, well, not...wasted, uh...I love you.
-- Homer backpedals, 

After the game, Bart lies dejectedly on Lisa's bed and listens to all
the praise she receives.

Marge: Let me give my special little winner a big, _big_ hug.
 Lisa: [tired] Ma, I think I'm all hugged out, heh...aw, one more.
        [Marge hugs her again]
        [Lisa walks into her room, turns on the light]
 Bart: Hello, queen Lisa.
 Lisa: Bart!  What are you doing in my room?
 Bart: Lisa, certain differences -- rivalries, if you will -- have come
       up between us.  At first I thought we could talk it over like
       civilized people.  But instead, I just ripped the head off Mr.
       Honeybunny.
        [holds up stuffed rabbit in one hand, head in the other]
 Lisa: Bart, that was _your_ cherished childhood toy.
 Bart: Aah!  Mr. Honeybunny!  [tries to repair it, kisses it]
Homer: Quiet down, Bart!
-- 

Lisa orders her brother to leave.

Lisa: Bart, just get outta here.
Bart: Hey: it's a free country.  _You_ get out.
Lisa: That doesn't make sense.
Bart: I know you are, but what am I?
Lisa: Get out, get out!
-- Sibling rivalry, 

 Bart: OK, but on my way, I'm going to be doing this: [windmills arms]
       If you get hit, it's your own fault.
 Lisa: OK, then I'm going to start kicking air like this.  [kicks] And
       if any part of you should fill that air, [kicks] it's _your_ own
       fault.
        [they walk towards each other, then start fighting]
Marge: Oh, I better go check that out.  Now Homer, don't you eat this
       pie!
Homer: OK...[Marge leaves] All right, pie, I'm just going to do this.
       [chomps air] And if you get eaten, it's your own fault!
        [walks towards pie, chomping air, and hits head on range head]
       Ow!  Oh, my -- aw, to hell with this.  [grabs pie, eats it]
-- 

Marge walks upstairs to find the children fighting.

Marge: Stop it, stop it, stop it!  [flicks light on and off]
 Bart: Mom, that is _really_ annoying.
 Lisa: Bart started it.
 Bart: Uh uh, Lisa started it.
Marge: I don't care _who_ started it.  I don't ever want to see you two
       fighting like that ever again.  We love you both: you're _not_ in
       competition with each other.  Repeat: you are not in competition
       with each other.
Homer: Hey!  Apu just called.  This Friday, Lisa's team is playing
       Bart's team.  You're in direct competition.  And don't go easy on
       each other just because you're brother and sister.  I want to see
       you both fighting for your parents' love!
        [flicks light on and off]
       Fight!  Fight!  Fight!  Fight!...
-- How not to encourage your children, 

[End of Act Two.  Time: 14:49]

At the Springfield prison...

Wiggum: All right, I'm going to make a little deal with you mugs.  I'm
        going to let you all out to see my team play the hockey game
        _if_ you promise to return to your cells.
 Snake: Sorry, pig, we can't make that promise.
Wiggum: All right...all right, I'll sweeten the deal.  You can see the
        game, you don't have to come back, _but_: you have to promise
        not to commit any more crimes, OK?
 Snake: No.
Wiggum: I'll take that as a yes.
         [turns the key, lets them out]
-- The best cop in Springfield, 

{At school, Sherri and Terri chant while playing jump rope.}

Sherri+Terri: {At seven tonight the games begin,
              Bart vs. Lisa: who will win?
              Their father's fat and their mother's thin,
              And Grampa Simpson reeks of gin!}
         Abe: {Hey!  [sniffs himself] That's "Obsession" for men.}
-- Perfume _does_ have a strong alcoholic component, 

It's dinnertime before the game.

Homer: [eating] Pass ketchup.
        [Bart winds up, slaps it with his knife]
 Lisa: [catches it] You'll have to do better than that tonight, _chump_.
        [Bart hits relish towards her and she ducks]
Homer: [catches it] I asked for ketchup!  I'm eating salad here.
Marge: I won't have any aggressive condiment passing in this house.
-- Anti-controversy and anti-aggression, 

Moe walks in.

  Moe: Hello.
Homer: Moe, what are you doing here?
  Moe: What?  What, a bartender can't come by and say hi to his best
       customer?  Hey, hey there, Midge.  Oh, gee, I like what you've
       done with your hair.
Marge: You caught me at a _real_ bad time, Moe.  I hope you understand
       I'm too tense to pretend I like you.
  Moe: Uh, and how are the little kids doing?  I mean, _really_, how are
       they doing?  Any disabling injuries, something, say, that the
       gambling community might not yet know about?  [grabs Bart's leg]
       Come here, let me see those knees.
Marge: [stands up] Moe, I think you should leave.  [forces him out]
  Moe: But Blanche, you gotta help me out here, please!  I'm 64 grand in
       the hole!  They're going to take my thumbs!
-- Moe's Italian, er, Sicilian, roots, 

During the pregame warmup, Bart skates up to Lisa.

Bart: Good luck tonight, _sis_.  I'll try not to hurt you.
Lisa: Don't worry, I'm wearing my lucky rabbit's head.  [pulls out a
      rabbit's head on a pendant]
Bart: [gasps] Mr. Honeybunny!  You inhuman monster.
Lisa: You want a piece of me?
       [they start slugging each other]
 Apu: [pulling them apart] Hey.  Hey!  Stop it, stop it!  Conserve your
      precious hatred for the game.
-- Sound advice, 

Homer, Marge, and Maggie watch from the stands.

Homer: Now that we're all alone, Marge, admit it: you like Lisa best!
Marge: No!
Homer: Oh, so you're a Bart woman, are you?
Marge: No!
Homer: Well, you can't possibly like Maggie best.  What's she ever done?
       Nothin' for nobody.
        [Maggie jumps up and catches a ketchup bottle headed for Homer's
       head]
Marge: Homer, we can't root for one child over the other.  You wouldn't
       like it if the kids played favorites with us.
        [on the ice]
 Bart: Hey, Mom!  Look at me, Mom!
 Lisa: Hi, Mom!  Over here!  Mom!
Homer: [chuckles] Hi kids!
-- Just before the big game, 

The red carpet rolls out.

Announcer: And now, to honor America, here's Krusty the Klown.
   Krusty: [singing] Oh say, can you see
           La la la, da da light,
           What so proudly we yah,
           La la yah...oh.  I shouldn't have turned down those cue
           cards.
-- At least the flag is right-side up, 

The game begins.  Bart wins the face-off against Jimbo and makes a dash
for the net.  Lisa looks determined.  Stopping just outside the blue
line, he takes a huge slap shot -- which beats the goalie!  "I love
Bart!" yells Homer.

On another breakaway, Bart takes another huge slap shot -- which Lisa
gets her glove in front of.  "No, wait!  I love Lisa!" yells Homer.
"Beer?" he says upon seeing Marge return from the concession stand, "Oh,
Marge!  I love you!"

Three players check Lisa into the net, and the crowd cheers.  Bart gets
the puck only to be slammed into the board, and the crowd cheers again.
Hans Moleman trips down the stairs, and the crowd points and cheers.
With 1:07 left in the third, the score knotted at three, Jimbo makes a
break, only to have the puck stolen by Bart.

           [on the ice, Jimbo trips Bart]
    Marge: He tripped my boy!  I demand vengeance.  I want vengeance!
Announcer: Jimbo Jones, called for tripping.  The penalty shot will be
           taken by Bart Simpson.
    Homer: Oh my God, Marge.  A penalty shot with only four seconds
           left.  It's your child versus mine!  The winner will be
           showered with praise; the loser will be taunted and booed
           until my throat is sore!
-- Homer, caring parent, 

Bart skates to center ice and puts his stick down emphatically.

    Wiggum: Kill her, boy!
       Apu: Stop him dead, little girl!
Bart crowd: _Kill_, Bart!  _Kill_, Bart!  _Kill_, Bart!
Lisa crowd: Kill _Bart_!  Kill _Bart_!  Kill _Bart_!
-- Bart takes a penalty shot, 

Bart and Lisa look around at the angry crowd, then Bart stops,
remembering a time when he lifted baby Lisa up to the cookie jar so she
could get a cookie for him.  Lisa remembers a time when she clapped
happily as a young Bart made finger shadows for her in front of a tilted
lamp.  Bart thinks of Lisa helping him bandage his knee after a
skateboarding accident.  Lisa remembers eating ice cream by the wading
pool and dropping her scoop, only to have Bart give her a scoop of his.

Both children smile, throw aside their equipment, and hug.  "Great game,
Lis."  "Great game, Bart."  The buzzer sounds

  Man 1: What the heck is a tie game?
  Man 2: Tie game?
Woman 1: What the hell?
Woman 2: This is outrageous!
  Marge: Oh, I've never been so proud of them.
  Homer: [weeping] They're both losers.  Losers!
    Abe: Rip-off!
   Hans: We paid for blood!
 Wiggum: Let's tear this place apart!
    Abe: Good idea!
-- A good-old hockey riot, 

Everyone rips into things and pummels each other.  Bart and Lisa skate
slowly down the ice, arm-in-arm.

Snake: Those kids are, like, so sweet.  [sobs] If only they had had
       peewee hockey when I was a lad.  [sniffs] Oh well.
        [grabs crowbar, rips seats apart]
-- Yet another lesson lost, 

The final shot shows people punching one another and fires burning
inside the arena.

[End of Act Three.  Time: 21:03]

The theme music over the credits is played on an organ so that it sounds
as though it's from a hockey game.
 EPISODE TITLE: Homer Bad Man


EPISODE SUMMARY: 
[Syndication cuts are marked in curly braces "{}" and are courtesy of
Ricardo Lafaurie and Frederic Briere.]

Bart pours himself a bowl of a cereal resembling Lucky Charms.

Bart: Aw, damn FDA!  Why can't it all be marshmallows?
Lisa: Ew!  Bart, don't put the non-marshmallow pieces back in the box.
      They go in the trash!
-- Bart eats Lucky Charms, 

Homer sees his children squabbling.

Homer: Ooh, you like sweets, kids?  I know a place that's sweeter than
       sweetness itself.  In this sweet place, earthly donuts are sour
       as poison -- you'd spit them out, you would!  [pounds fist]
       I'm talking about...[pulls out tickets] the Candy Industry Trade
       Show!  Hee hee.
 Lisa: How did _you_ get tickets?
Homer: They hid them in every millionth Krusty Klump Bar and Krusty
       Klump Bar with Almonds.
        [flash to Homer opening all the wrappers at the Kwik-E-Mart]
  Apu: Hey.  Hey!  Hey!  I have asked you nicely not to mangle my
       merchandise.  You leave me no choice but to...ask you nicely
       again.
-- The perils of convenience store ownership, 

Bart and Lisa beg Homer to let them go.

 Bart: Can I come to the candy show, huh, huh?  Can I, can I?  Huh, huh,
       huh?  Can I?  Can I?
 Lisa: No, me!  Take me, me, me, me, me, me!  Take me, me!
Homer: Sorry, kids, but this is the one event I want my darling wife by
       my side.
Marge: Oh, well thank you, Homer, but take one of the kids.
Homer: Marge, they can't carry enough candy!  They have puny little
       muscles, not big ropy ones like you.
Marge: Mmm...
 Bart: You go, Mom, for the greater good.
 Lisa: For the greater good.
-- Altruism in Springfield, 

Homer has Marge dress in a grey trenchcoat which Bart and Lisa sew extra
pockets onto.

Marge: Homer, are all these pockets necessary?
Homer: They wouldn't be if you were willing to sit in a hollowed-out
       wheelchair!
-- The parents prepare for Candy Convention departure, 

        [doorbell rings]
 Marge: Oh, that's the babysitter.  No one in town will sit for you two
        any more.  I had to choose between a grad student at the
        university and a scary-looking hobo.
  Bart: [going to answer door] Please the hobo, please the hobo, please
        the hobo -- [opens it]
Ashley: Hi, I'm Ashley Grant.
  Bart: [groaning] Oh...
-- No Bart, put it down, Bart, 

Lisa recognizes her.

 Lisa: [gasps] Ashley Grant!  You gave a talk on women's issues at my
       school on how we don't have to be second-class citizens.
 Bart: [indignant] Mom!  How can you leave us with this maniac?
Homer: Hurry, Marge!  If we get there early we can get our pictures
       taken with the two surviving Musketeers!  [drags here]
Marge: There's also a baby somewhere upstairs -- ooh!  [leaves]
-- No time to waste, 

  Bart: So...you're one of those "Don't call me a chick" chicks, huh?
  Lisa: Ehh, sorry about my unenlightened brother.  He _will_ make the
        next few hours a living hell.
Ashley: Oh, I don't know.  See this, Bart?
         [dangles "Disembowler IV" video game cartridge]
  Bart: "Disembowler IV": the game where condemned criminals dig at each
        other with rusty hooks.
Ashley: Mm hmm.  Do a little housework and you can play for five
        minutes.
  Bart: No way.  [turns away, but has to turn back] Argh!  Yes, 'm.
Ashley: See, Lisa?  Males aren't hard to tame.  They all follow their...
        video cartridges.
         [swings it towards wall, Bart follows and smashes his nose]
  Bart: Ow.
-- The silicon and plastic 1990s carrot, 

The Candy Convention takes place in Room 1 at the community center.
Homer and Marge walk straight in past the barricades, where club-
wielding policemen stand guard in front of a throng of children.  Homer
giggles on his way in.

  Man: [over PA] Mr. Goodbar to the front desk.  The front desk is
       looking for Mr. Goodbar.
Homer: Ooh!  I feel like a kid in some kind of a store.
-- Homer arrives at the Candy Convention, 

Homer takes immediate advantage of all the free samples.  "Brilliant...
exquisite...ooh, you'll do well...gimme those!" he says through a full
mouth, running from one exhibit to the next.

Dr. Frink introduces his latest invention.

Frink: As you can see, I have created a lemon ball so sour, it can only
       be safely contained in a magnetic field.  The candy, known as
       77X42 is -- hey!  [looks in case] Where the hell's the candy?
Homer: [face grossly contorted] I dunno...
-- 

{Homer walks up to another booth.}

  Man: {Hey, sir!  Try our wax lips: the candy of 1000 uses.}
Homer: {[skeptical] Like what?}
  Man: {One, a humorous substitute for your own lips.}
Homer: {Mm hmm, keep going.}
  Man: {Two, er...ooh, I'm needed in the basement!}
-- Homer at the Wax Lips booth, 

{The man walks back and forth, gradually disappearing from sight as he
walks down the "stairs".  At the bottom, he peeps over the counter, sees
Homer still there, and ducks quickly.  "Hmm," says Homer, emptying a
bowl of wax lips into his pants and walking away.}

Marge, her trenchcoat stuffed to overflowing, sits down on a bench and
pulls out a piece of celery.  A security guard walks up and says, "All
right, you're going to have to put some sugar on that celery or get out,
ma'am."

The "Jolly Gummi Bears" display is a popular one.

Homer: Ooh, gummi bears!  Gummi calves' heads...gummi jaw breakers!
        [sees a gummi figure on a red pillow in a glass case, turning]
Homer: [lustily] Ohh...[walks up] What's that?
  Man: [German accent] That is the rarest gummi of them all, the gummi
       Venus de Milo, carved by gummi artisans who were exclusively in
       the medium of gummi.
Marge: Will you two stop saying "gummi" so much?
-- Gummi jaw breakers?, 

The gummi Venus de Milo winks.

Homer: Must have rare gummi...[to Marge] Distract the salesman.
Marge: No!  I won't make a spectacle out of myself any further.
        [her pocket bursts, spilling candy out]
        [sheepish] Oh, oh.  How'd they get there?  [laughs]
        [everyone helps her pick up]
Homer: Now, this is going to take all my skill...heh heh heh.
        [smashes glass, takes Venus de Milo; an alarm sounds]
  Man: Halt, halt!
Homer: Run, Marge!  Save the booty!
-- The Candy Convention ends abruptly, 

Everyone chases after Homer and Marge, who has trouble running with her
stuffed trenchcoat.  Homer stops at the exit, kicks a Buzz Cola machine
to get a can of pop, rips the tab off with his teeth, rips open a packet
of Pop Rox, and puts the packet over the can and shakes it.  "See you in
hell, candy boys!" he calls, lobbing it into the crowd.  They all stop
to watch as Homer continues to run in slow motion, the glass of the
doors shattering behind him with the force of the fiery blast.

At home, Marge giggles as the children explore under her trenchcoat.

 Bart: Hey Lis, I found a big caramel deposit at the small of her back!
 Lisa: [under the coat] I'm coming!
        [the coat bursts and deluges candy in a big pile]
        [Bart and Lisa fall out, laughing and cheering]
Homer: Wait a minute, wait a minute!  Where's my Gummi de Milo?  OK,
       don't panic, she can't have gotten far.  She has no arms.
Marge: [exasperated] I'm sure it'll turn up!  Take the babysitter home
       now.  She's been sitting in the car for twenty minutes.
Homer: Relax, Marge, there's plenty for her to do in there.  [horn honks
       outside] See?  She's having the time of her life.
-- Bet she's flashing the headlights too, 

On the way home, Homer tries his hand at conversation.

 Homer: So, a graduate student, huh?  How come you guys can go to the
        moon but you can't make my shoes smell good?
Ashley: I'm sorry?
 Homer: Aw, nobody's blaming you.  Hey: could you take the wheel for a
        second?  I have to scratch myself in two places at once.
Ashley: [repulsed] Just drop me off here.
         [Homer stops the car; Ashley gets out]
 Homer: [sees Venus de Milo on Ashley's pants] [gasps] Precious Venus...
         [rips it off; Ashley looks back to see Homer drooling lustily]
Ashley: Aah!  [slams door, runs off]
 Homer: Thank you.  [eats it]
-- Not too priceless to enjoy digesting, 

The next day, Bart and Lisa walk downstairs slowly, holding their
stomachs and groaning.

Homer: Hey kids!  Lots of candy left for breakfast.
        [Bart and Lisa groan]
Marge: Why don't we give it to some needy children then?
        [Bart and Lisa groan negatively, lie on candy, eat it slowly]
-- The morning after the candyfest, 

Suddenly, a clamoring crowd appears outside.

 Homer: Oh no!  The candy conventioneers tracked us down.
         [looks out window]
Ashley: [outside] There he is!  There's the man that sexually harassed
        me!
 Homer: Whew!  For a minute there, I thought I was in big trouble.  It's
        just the -- [realizes] D'oh!
-- Homer uses all the power of his brain, 

[End of Act One.  Time: 6:37]

The crowd outside the Simpson home chants.

Crowd: Two!  Four!  Six!  Eight!
       Homer's crime was very great!
        [pause]
       "Great" meaning "large" or "immense",
       We use it in the pejorative sense!
Homer: Marge, I swear I didn't touch her.  You know how bashful I am --
       I can't even say the word "titmouse" without giggling like a
       schoolgirl.  [giggles]
Marge: Er, at any rate, I believe you and I think you should go outside
       and straighten this out.  Some of their chants are very catchy
       and memorable.
-- Who can forget "pejorative"?, 

Homer walks out, in his bathrobe, to confront them.

Ashley: You grabbed me in the car!
 Homer: Oh, that.  No, I was just grabbing a gummi Venus de Milo that
        got stuck to your pants.
 Woman: Yeah, right.  That's the oldest excuse in the book.
         [crowd boos, hisses]
 Homer: C'mon!  I'm a decent guy.
         [window blows up his bathrobe, uncovering his shame]
         [crows boos, hisses]
-- "Decent" not being the opposite of "indecent", 

Homer runs back in the house just before being pelted by vegetables
thrown by the crowd.

 Bart: Why would anybody want to touch a girl's butt?  That's where
       cooties come from!
 Lisa: Dad, I don't understand.  What is she saying you did?
Homer: Well, Lisa, remember that postcard Grampa sent us from Florida of
       that alligator biting that woman's bottom?
 Bart: Oh, yeah, _that_ was _brilliant_!
Homer: That's right, we _all_ thought it was hilarious.  But it turns
       out we were wrong: that alligator was sexually harassing that
       woman.
 Bart: And the dog in the Coppertone ad?  Same deal, Dad?
Homer: Well, there's kind of a grey area.
-- Not in the nineties, there's not, 

Lisa reassures him, "_We_ know you're innocent, Dad."  Homer thanks his
children, but Marge observes that the protesters are building a shanty-
town of tents.  They camp out over night, and the minute Homer drives
his car out of the garage, the protesters surround him, pounding the
metal.  "Do your worst, protesters!  You can't stop me from living my
life!"  The protesters continue to dog him in the middle of the freeway,
one yelling "No respect for women -- no peace!"

At his work station, two protesters continue to rock Homer back and
forth.

          [protesters surround Homer at work]
     Man: Just try to push the right buttons now!
   Woman: We ain't crazy about nuclear power either!
Smithers: [walking in] You people aren't allowed in here.
           [everyone stops, quiet]
   Homer: [sullen] It's OK, they're with me.
           [Smithers walks out, everyone starts to yell again]
-- The Geneva protesters' convention, 

In bed that night, Homer sighs, glad to be finally rid of them.

Homer: They're ruining my whole life.  Marge, please, this is where I
       need you the most: I'm counting on you do to something or say
       something to make it all better.  OK...go!
Marge: Homer --
Homer: [anxious] Uh huh?
Marge: -- I already talked to the indignation coordinator out on the
       lawn today.  I told her you were a decent man, but she wouldn't
       listen.  Besides standing by you and supporting you, there isn't
       any more I can do.
Homer: You mean...I'm on my own?  I've never been on my own!  Oh no...on
       own...on own!  I need help...oh, God, help me.  Help me, God!
        [phone rings, Homer answers it very slowly]
Homer: [very slowly] Y'ello?
  Man: Hello, Homer.  This is God...frey Jones from the TV magazine show
       "Rock Bottom".
-- Does the first syllable count?, 

The scene switches to Jones at his desk.

Jones: We're aware of your problems, and, Mr. Simpson...we want to help.
Homer: Mmm.  I saw that report you did on Sasquatch.  It was fair and
       even-handed.  I'll do it!
-- "Rock Bottom"'s laurels, 

Homer is interviewed on-camera by Godfrey Jones.

Homer: Ehh, someone had to take the babysitter home.  Then I noticed she
       was sitting on the gummi Venus, so I grabbed it off her.  Oh,
       just thinking about that sweet, sweet candy...[moans lustfully] I
       just wish I had another one right now.  But the most important
       thing is --
Jones: That was really great Mr. Simpson.  We got everything we need.
Homer: OK.  Say, can you introduce me to the Sasquatch?  I like his
       style.
-- The interview on "Rock Bottom", 

Homer and the rest of his family watch the report that night on "Rock
Bottom".

 Homer: Hee hee!  Here comes the bouncing ball of justice!
 Jones: Tonight on "Rock Bottom", we go undercover at a sex farm for sex
        hookers.
Farmer: I keep telling you, I just grow sorghum here.
   Man: Uh huh.  And where are the hookers?
Farmer: [points] 'round back.  [realizes] Whoops.
 Jones: But first:
         [photo of Ashley and her parents at graduation]
        She was a university honor student who devoted her life to kids,
         [slomo of Homer reaching for his car keys]
        until the night a grossly-overweight pervert named Homer Simpson
        gave her a crash course in depravity.  "Babysitter and the
        Beast"!
-- The "Rock Bottom" show, 

"Aw, crap," laments Homer as the interview is shown.

Homer: Somebody had to take the babysitter home.  Then I noticed she was
       sitting on [splice] her sweet [splice] can.  [splice] -- o I grab
       her -- [splice] sweet can.  [splice] Oh, just thinking about
       [splice] her [splice] can [splice] I just wish I had he --
       [splice] sweet [splice] sweet [splice] s-s-sweet [splice] can.
Jones: So, Mr. Simpson: you admit you grabbed her can.  What do you have
       to say in your defense?
Homer: [looking lustful in a clearly-paused VCR shot]
Jones: Mr. Simpson, your silence will only incriminate you further.
        [paused shot of Homer grows larger]
       No, Mr. Simpson, don't take your anger out on me.  Get back!  Get
       back!  Mist -- Mr. Simpson -- nooo!
  Man: [quickly] Dramatization -- may not have happened.
-- High-quality "Rock Bottom" journalism, 

Homer: [fearfully] Marge?  Kids?  Everything's going to be just fine.
       No go upstairs, and pack your bags...we're going to start a new
       life...under the sea.
        [calypso music starts]
        [Homer dances with fish as Lisa plays a seahorse saxophone,
       Marge a squid harp, and Bart the xylophone clams]
Homer: [eats a dancing fish, sings]
       Under the sea, under the sea,
        [eats a couple more fish]
       There'll be no accusations, just friendly crustaceans
       Under the sea!
        [eats a line of seahorses, grabs an escaping one]
        [eats a live crab as though it were a shrimp]
        [eats a pair of dancing fish, then a snail who tries to escape]
        [stands there with fish skeletons floating about]
Marge: Homer, that's your solution to everything: to move under the sea.
       It's not going to happen!
Homer: Not with _that_ attitude!
-- The little Homer mermaid, 

Marge: Look, maybe this whole thing will blow over.
        [helicopters swoop over the house; news vans pull up]
Homer: It didn't blow over, Marge.  Nothing _ever_ blows over for me.
        [the car gets flipped by the wind from the helicopters]
-- They only blow over literally, 

The next morning, Homer gets out of the shower to see helicopters
looking into his bathroom window.  He panics and slips as cameras flash.
The picture appears on the news that night.

Newsman: Simpson scandal update: Homer sleeps nude in an oxygen tent
         which he believes gives him sexual powers.
  Homer: Hey -- that's a half-truth!
         {[changes channels to Sally Jesse Raphael]}
  Woman: {[weeping] I don't know Homer Simpson, I -- I never met Homer
         Simpson or had any contact with him, but -- [cries
         uncontrollably] -- I'm sorry, I can't go on.}
  Sally: {That's OK: your tears say more than real evidence _ever_
         could.}

Announcer: Today on "Ben": mothers and runaway daughters reunited by
           their hatred of Homer Simpson.  And here's your host, Gentle
           Ben.
            [a bear wearing a helmet with a microphone runs out]
  Woman 1: I just have one thing to say: let's have less Homer Simpson
           and more money for public schools.
            [smattering of applause; Ben growls]
  Woman 2: Ben, I have a question --
            [Ben runs over to tables piled with food]
      Man: No, Ben, no!
            [Ben swats him away; men shoot tranquilizers into him]
-- Nightmare daytime talk shows, 

Ben is about to collapse onto the crowd, but the screen goes blank just
in time.  Homer changes the channels again.

Announcer: And now we return to "Fox Night at the Movies": "Homer S.:
           Portrait of an Ass-Grabber", starring Dennis Franz.
    Homer: Ooh, "portrait"!  Sounds classy.  [looks at family, who look
           away] Doesn't it?
            [on screen, Franz laughs as he drives through a line of
           parking meters while the babysitter screams]
            [a cat cleans itself in the middle of the road]
 "Ashley": No, Mr. Simpson!  A cat is a living creature.
  "Homer": I don't care.  [runs it over]
            [crashes into some garbage bins]
  "Homer": Now I'm going to grab me some _sweet_.
 "Ashley": No, Mr. Simpson, that's sexual harassment.  If you keep it
           up, I'll yell so loud the whole country will hear
  "Homer": [laughs] With a _man_ in the White house?  [laughs] Not
           likely!  [laughs more]
-- Unbiased media coverage, as usual, 

On another channel, Kent Brockman commentates from a helicopter.

Kent: This is hour 57 of our live, round-the-clock coverage outside the
      Simpson estate.  Remember, by the way, to tune in at 8:00 for
      highlights of today's vigil, including when the garbage man came
      and when Marge Simpson put the cat out...possibly because it was
      harassed, we don't know.
      Of course, there's no way to see into the Simpson home without
      some kind of infrared heat-sensitive camera.  So, let's turn it
      on.
       [screen shows blue house, orange Simpsons watching TV]
      Now, this technology is new to me, but...I'm pretty sure that's
      Homer Simpson in the oven, rotating slowly.  [closeup of turkey]
      His body temperature has risen to over 400 degrees -- he's
      literally stewing in his own juices.
       [in the studio] Now, here are some results from our phone-in
      poll: 95% of the people believe Homer Simpson is guilty.  Of
      course, this is just a television poll which is not legally
      binding, unless proposition 304 passes.  And we all pray it will.
-- Channel Six's coverage, 

Homer mourns.

 Homer: Oh...I don't have a friend in the world.
   Moe: [outside] Let us through!
Barney: [outside] ...Homer's true friends!
 Marge: Oh, _really_?
   Moe: Come on, let us through, you vultures!
 Homer: Oh, Marge, it's a miracle.
   Moe: How can you judge this man without talking to the people who
        know him best?  _We_ got the real dirt on Homer Simpson, and the
        bidding starts at ten G's!
 Man 1: I bid ten G's!
 Man 2: Ten-five G's!
-- Homer's true materialistic friends, 

Homer closes the curtain dejectedly.

    Homer: Aw, I need a hug.
            [everyone pauses, then hugs him]
           How come you guys hesitated?
     Lisa: Sorry, Dad, we _do_ believe in you, we really do.
     Bart: It's just hard not to listen to TV: it's spent so much more
           time raising us than you have.
    Homer: Oh, maybe TV _is_ right.  TV's _always_ right!  [walks
           upstairs]
            [Bart and Lisa hug the TV]
            [from upstairs] Are you hugging the TV?!
Bart+Lisa: No...[kiss it]

[End of Act Two.  Time: 16:00]

Homer watches TV in the fetal position on his bed.

 Letterman: And the number one reference that I am running into the
            ground is..."Homer Simpson"!
             [music starts, audience laughs]
             [changes channel to Chespirito who gets his butt pinched]
Chespirito: Aie aie aie!  Es Homer Simpson.  Me ha molestado!  Oh!
            {[the flower he was smelling wilts]}
     Homer: {Oh, I like it better when they're making fun of people who
            _aren't_ me.}  [gasps] I know, "Evening at the Improv".
            They never talk about anything beyond the 1980s.  [flips]
  Comedian: See, I think about weird stuff.  Like, what would happen if
            E.T. and Mr. T had a baby?  Heh, well, you'd get Mr. E.T.,
            wouldn't you?  And you know, I think he'd sound a little
            something like this: "I pity the fool who doesn't phone
            home."  [audience laughs]
     Homer: [laughs] Ooh, I wouldn't want to be Mr. T right now.
-- Relief from the Homer Simpson fiasco, 

Marge rushes in.

Marge: Homer!  Homer, the kids have a great idea how you can clear your
       name.
 Lisa: The media's making a monster out of you because they don't care
       about the truth!  All they care about is entertainment.  Well,
       _you_ need a forum where they don't even know the _meaning_ of
       the word "entertainment": public access television.
Homer: Aw, but those shows all look so crummy.
Marge: Well we could dress it up a bit...we can bring a fern, and a
       folding chair from the garage, and the most decorative thing of
       all -- the truth!
        [everyone looks at her]
-- Marge, interior decorator, 

Inside a studio at Channel Three, Abe helps them decorate by hanging a
large U.S. flag behind Homer's podium.

Marge: There are only 49 stars on that flag.
  Abe: I'll be deep in the cold, cold ground before I recognize
       Missourah!
-- P.S.  I am not a crackpot, 

The camera rolls.

 Lisa: And now it's time for the Innocence Report with Homer Simpson.
       [holds sign: "Innocence Report"]
Homer: Hello.  I am Homer Simpson, or as some of you wags have dubbed
       me, Father Goose.  You know, everybody believed the worst about
       me right away; nobody cares that I didn't do it.  But I didn't!
       OK, look: I've done some bad things in my life, but harassing
       women is not one of them.  [softly] Like one time, we were having
       this race with the stupid old tiny bicycle with the big wheel in
       front, so I figure, "We'll see about that!"  So I get this big
       chunk of cinderblock, and --
Marge: [makes choking noises]
Homer: Oh, gotta go.  [walks off]
        [pops head back on] Innocent!
-- Classy public access TV, 

Lisa can't restrain herself.

    Lisa: Dad, you did it!  I am so proud of you.
     Kid: The switchboards are lighting up!
Everyone: Yay!
     Kid: Two calls: that's our best ever!  [answers one] Hello?  No,
          Janice doesn't live here...[answers other] Hello?  Yes, I _am_
          interested in long-distance savings!  _Very_ interested.
-- 1-800-PIN...aw, forget it, 

Homer is despondent.

Homer: [stirring a bowl] Aw, Marge, this is so depressing, my only hope
       is this homemade Prozac.  [tastes it] Mmm, needs more ice cream.
-- Homer's appeal to the public fails, 

The doorbell rings.

        [Homer answers the door]
   Man: [on pennyfarthing bicycle] So, er, you don't like the old-time
        bikes, huh?
         [kicks Homer in the face, rides off]
         [doorbell rings again; Homer answers]
 Willy: Homer!  I _love_ amateur video, and your show is the most
        amateur video I ever saw.  My hobby is secretly videotaping
        couples in cars.  I dinna come forward because in this country,
        it makes you look like a pervert -- but _every_ single Scottish
        person does it!
         [puts in videotape]
Quimby: [on TV] Oh baby, oh yeah, oh baby --
 Willy: Aw, no, that's Mayor Quimby.  [fast forwards] Ah, here we go.
 Homer: [on TV] Precious Venus...[gargles]
Ashley: Aah!  [slams door, runs off]
 Homer: Thank you!  [eats gummi Venus]
  Lisa: Dad, this clears you completely!
 Marge: You know, the courts might not work any more, but as long as
        everybody is videotaping everyone else, justice will be done.
-- A sad comment on American society, 

Homer takes the tape to the women's dorm at Springfield University.

  Lisa: See?
Ashley: Hmm.  Homer, I thought you were an animal, but your daughter
        said you were a decent man.  I guess she was right.
 Homer: You're _both_ right.
-- Homer's innocence, stored on video, 

On "Rock Bottom", Godfrey Jones is apologetic.

   Jones: In our mad pursuit of the scoop, we members of the press
          sometimes...make mistakes.  "Rock Bottom" would like to make
          the following corrections.
           [a list scrolls by very, very quickly]
    Bart: Wow!  V8 juice _isn't_ one-eighth gasoline.
   Homer: And Ted Koppel _is_ a robot!
    Lisa: There's you, Dad!
Everyone: Yay!
   Jones: Tomorrow, on "Rock Bottom":
           [slomo of Willy walking into Godfrey's office] he's a
          foreigner who takes perverted videos of you when you least
          expect it.  He's "Rowdy Roddy Peeper"...
   Homer: Oh, that man is _sick_!
   Marge: Groundskeeper Willy saved you, Homer.
   Homer: But listen to the music!  He's evil!
   Marge: Hasn't this experience taught you you can't believe everything
          you hear?
   Homer: Marge, my friend, I haven't learned a thing.
           [family walks off, disgruntled]
   Homer: [hugs TV] Let's never fight again.

EPISODE SUMMARY: 
[Syndication cuts are marked in curly braces "{}" and are courtesy of
Ricardo Lafaurie and Frederic Briere.]

A TV screen displays "Thou$and Dollar Movie".

Announcer: We now return to the 1971 film, "Good-Time Slim, Uncle
           Doobie, and the Great 'Frisco Freak-Out", starring Troy
           McClure.
            [a multicolored VW bug is chased by police]
      Man: Slim, if we've got the bag with the stolen diamonds, then
           what happened to the bag with our stash?
     Slim: There's more than one way to get high, baby.

            [Marge, dressed seductively, snuggles with Homey]
    Homer: Please, Marge!  How often can I see a movie of this calibre
           on late-night TV?
    Marge: Is there something wrong, Homey?
    Homer: No!  It's just that I've only seen this movie twice before
           and I've seen you every night for the last eleven ye -- er,
           what I meant to say is, uh, we'll snuggle tomorrow sweetie.
           I promise.
-- Homer's promises, never broken, 

A month later, a much fatter Homer groans and sits down on the bed,
sighing "Enchiladas..." Marge, dressed seductively again, turns away
from him, disappointed, as Homer's pants button pops off.

Later that year, Homey and Marge finally get time naked together.

       Bart: [bursting in] Mom!  Dad!
Homer+Marge: Don't turn on the light!  Don't turn on the light!
       Bart: There's a UFO outside my window.  Seriously!
              [in Bart's room]
      Marge: Oh, Bart, it's just an old golf umbrella stuck in a tree.
              [it dislodges and swoops towards the window]
       Bart: Aah!  C-c-can I sleep in there with you guys tonight?
      Marge: No.
       Bart: Can I sit on the roof with a baseball bat in case a UFO
             _does_ come?
      Marge: Yes, yes, yes, that's fine.  Good, good.  [walks out]
-- Marge, always the concerned parent, 

Back in the parents' bedroom...

Marge: Mmm, I hope you kept the Homey-fires burning.
        [Homer snores]
       Homer...
Homer: Huh?
Marge: Homer, wake up!  Wake up!
Homer: Wha?
Marge: We need to talk about the -- marital difficulties we've been
       having lately.
Homer: Marge, there's just too much pressure, what with my job, the
       kids, traffic snarls, political strife at home and abroad.  But I
       promise you, the second all those things go away, we'll have sex.
Marge: I simply can't wait that long.  Maybe we should get some help...
       how about a book?
Homer: [excited] Ooh, OK!
Marge: A _tasteful_ book.
Homer: [unexcited] Oh, all right.
-- Dear Penthouse Forum, 

{The parents hear a clattering noise as Bart falls off the roof with a
yell.  He rings the doorbell.}

The next day, the family go to "Books!  Books!  And Additional Books!",
where the daily special is Michener at $1.99/lb.  In the "Marital
Relations" section, some of the titles featured are "Weight Loss Through
Laborious Sex", "Bordello Repair", "Bork on Sex", "How to Seduce Your
Lousy, Lazy Husband", "Kama Sutra", and "Kosher Erotic Cakes."

Homer: [looking at Kama Sutra] Hey Marge!  This guy looks like Apu.
Marge: Shh.  I don't want people to see us looking at these books.
        [Bart and Lisa walk up]
 Bart: Hi, guys.  Whatcha lookin' at?
        [Homer and Marge fumble books]
Marge: Um...I'm just reading up on -- ["Tanks of the Third Reich"] --
       artillery.
Homer: Yes, and I'm pursuing my interest in -- ["Mapplethorpe"] -- aah!
-- At the book store, 

Marge heads to the "Books on Tape" section.

  Marge: This one's a good choice, and it's not too smutty.  It's a book
         on tape by Paul Harvey, you know, that nice midwestern man on
         the radio who's like a pleasant version of Grampa?
  Homer: Ooh!  "Mr. and Mrs. Erotic American."
   Lisa: Mom!  Dad!  Look, this biography of Peter Ueberroth is only
         99c.  And I found the new Al Gore book.  [holds it up]
  Marge: "Sane Planning, Sensible Tomorrow."
   Lisa: Yeah, I hope it's as exciting as his other book, "Rational
         Thinking, Reasonable Future".
   Bart: I'm getting this book on UFOs.  ["Unidentified Flying
         Outrage!"]  Did you know they're real, but there's a huge
         government conspiracy to cover it up?
   Lisa: Oh, that's just a paranoid fantasy.
          [the man runs Lisa's book over the scanner]
          [a signal travels down through the scanner, over wires, to a
         satellite dish, up to a satellite, and down to the Pentagon]
          [a man in uniform grabs a printout and dashes off to the White
         House]
Officer: Mr. Vice President!  Someone finally bought a copy of your
         book, sir.
Al Gore: Well, this calls for a celebration.
          [puts on a Kool 'n' the Gang record: "Celebrate good times...
         "]
         I will.
-- Celebrating sanely for a sensible tomorrow, "Grampa vs. Sexual
    Inadequacy"

A tape player plays the Paul Harvey cassette.  Marge and Homer sit on
the bed listening.

     Harvey: Hello, Americans, Paul Harvey here.  Did you know every
             good American is at heart an erotic American?  It's true.
             A famous couple -- I don't need to tell you it was Dwight
             and Mamie Eisenhower -- offered _this_ advice: "Double your
             pleasure with a bath...together!"
              [Homer sits in the bathtub, a lit candle perched nearby]
      Marge: [climbing in, straining] Homey, I can't quite --
      Homer: Faucet's jammed into my back...I'm stuck!
      Marge: [grunts] So am I!
      Homer: [strains; dislodges faucet] Oh!
              [water sprays into Marge's face; a drop extinguishes the
             candle]
Homer+Marge: Kids?  Kids!
-- 

In the car, Homer and Marge continue listening to the tape.

 Harvey: A romantic vacation can provide titillation.  Sensual, sanitary
         seclusion awaits you at any of America's fine AAA-approved
         motor lodges.
          [they pull up to the "Aphrodite Inn"]
  Marge: The Arabian Nights Room looks nice.
  Homer: Ooh, the Pharaoh's Chamber has a vibrating sarcophagus.
Manager: Er, sorry there, Fred and Ethel, you should have made a
         reservation.  We only got one room left.
 Quimby: [dressed in leopard skin] The toilet is overflowing in the
         Caveman Room!
          [Marge and Homer walk past "Safari Room" and "Camelot Room"]
  Homer: Oh, here we are: [opens door] [lusty] the Utility Room.
          [it's a real utility room with two cots]
  Marge: This isn't very erotic.  It's an actual utility room.
  Homer: No, honey: it's a romantic fantasy.  I imagine I'm the janitor
         and you're...the janitor's wife, who has to live with me in the
         utility room.
          [they lie down on the cots]
Manager: [walking in] Don't mind me, folks, just need to get the old
         wet-dry vac.
-- With occasional interruptions from the motel manager, "Grampa vs.
    Sexual Inadequacy"

Homer and Marge look less than impressed in the car the next day.

Harvey: By now your new, improved lovelife should have you flinging woo
        like nobody's business.  So to you, Mr. and Mrs. Erotic
        American, I bid...goodday.
         [the tape flies out the car window and onto the road]
         [Homer stops, backs up, and repeatedly drives over the tape]
-- Paul Harvey's love advice fails, 

Grampa greets Homer and Marge as they walk in the door.

  Abe: Welcome home, Son.  I broke two lamps and lost all your mail.
       [Marge walks away] What's wrong with your wife?
Homer: Never mind, you wouldn't understand.
  Abe: Flu?
Homer: No.
  Abe: Protein deficiency?
Homer: No.
  Abe: Pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis?
Homer: No.
  Abe: Unsatisfying sex life?
Homer: N -- yes!  But please, don't _you_ say that word!
  Abe: What, seeeex?  What's so unappealing about hearing your elderly
       father talk about sex?  I had seeex.
Homer: [groans]
-- Once, 

Homer takes Abe back to the Springfield Retirement Castle.

Homer: You're home safe.  Done my duty.  See you the next time we need
       your signature.
  Abe: Aw, you never want to spend any time with me.  Well I can help
       you with your lovin' problem: I got a home remedy that'll put the
       zowsers back in your trousers.
        [walks to sink, plugs it, starts pouring things from his
       medicine cabinet in]
       Legend has it my great grandpappy stumbled upon this recipe when
       he was trying to invent a cheap substitute for holy water.
        [bottles some]
       Here you g -- [sees Homer has left] Hey!
        [opens curtains] Here you go, you ingrate.  Think of me when
       you're having the best sex of your life.
-- Ew, 

Abe tosses the bottle out the window to Homer: "Drink it!"  Homer does
so, then twitches and smiles.  He skids away home.

       [Homer opens the door resolutely, then unplugs the TV]
        [the kids, watching it, open their mouths]
Homer: [quickly] Kids!  Here's $50, why not go to the movies, then take
       a cab to your aunts' house?  Stay there, phone call you later.
       Now, now, now!
        [sweeps Marge into his arms]
Marge: Whoa!  Homey, what's --
Homer: Marge, I'll explain to you afterwards.

       Maggie sit in the front row]
 Lisa: What do you think Mom and Dad are doing right now?
 Bart: I dunno.
-- Abe's miracle love tonic does its work, "Grampa vs. Sexual
    Inadequacy"

[End of Act One.  Time: 7:34]

Homer shaves, whistling.  Marge appears at the bathroom door and clears
her throat admiringly.

Marge: Here he is: Rex Harrison and Paul Anka rolled into one.  Ooh,
       hmm.  That tonic really works -- you and Grampa should bottle it
       and go into business together.
Homer: You want me to spend _more_ time with Dad?  What about my New
       Year's resolution?
Marge: You can make a lot of money...
Homer: Yeah!  Where are my pants?
Marge: You threw them out the window in a fit of passion.  You said you
       were never going to need them again.
       {[outside, said pants are stuck in the Flanders' tree]}
Maude: {Oh, hurry Neddy.  They're awful!}
  Ned: {[trying to dislodge them] You just be ready with that garbage
       bag!}
-- Pants of pollution, 

At the Springfield Retirement Castle, Abe mixes a giant batch of tonic
in his bathtub with a canoe paddle.  Homer bottles the concoction.

Homer: Ooh, Mama!  This is _finally_ really happening.  After years of
       disappointment with get-rich-quick schemes, I _know_ I'm gonna
       get Rich with _this_ scheme...and _quick_!
-- The bottling business begins, 

Homer and Abe set up a stand at the Springfield Mall.

Homer: Sir!  Uh, hello sir!  Yes, you look like a man who needs help
       satisfying his wife.  So --
        [man slugs him in the face]
       Ow!  Oh...I guess people have some sort of _moral_ objection to
       our sex drug.
  Abe: [grabbing bottle] Lemme sell it, you idjit.
        [takes deep breath] Step right up, folks, and witness the
       magnificent medicinal miracle of Simpson &amp; Son's patented
       revitalizing toniiic.
        [takes deep breath] Put some ardor in your larder with our
       energizing, moisturizing, tantalizing, romanticizing, surprising,
       her-prizing, revitalizing tonic.
        [a large crowd has gathered; they clap and cheer]
-- Abe, closet huckster, 

Sales increase dramatically.  Professor John Frink even buys a bottle.

     Frink: N-hey, I doubt very highly that one elixir could boast so
            many fantastic properties.
             [drinks some; turns into a handsome man]
             [smooth voice] What say we am-scray outta here and have a
            wild wingding at the cyclotron, doctor?
Mrs. Frink: [geeky] Anything you _say_, professor!  Whoa...
-- John Frink discovers Simpson &amp; Son's tonic, "Grampa vs. Sexual

Milhouse's parents cash in, too.

Mr. Van Houten: Tonight, we'll push the twin beds together...and I found
                something for Milhouse down at the mall, too: [hands it
                to him] a pup tent!
      Milhouse: Oh, boy!  Now I can sleep out in the yard.
Mr. Van Houten: Yeah!  Every single night...

the drapes.

{Dr. Hibbert has some qualms about the new tonic.  He reveals his fears
to his seductively-dressed wife who lies on their bed.}

Hibbert: {I've discovered that the rejuvenating effect people feel is
         actually a mild form of poisoning -- no doubt a result of the
         unsanitary conditions in Grampa Simpson's bathtub.  Nonetheless

scene.

Milhouse: What's going on?  Where are all the grown-ups?
  Nelson: Who cares?  With no adults, I _run_ this city.
           [pauses, looks awkward]
          Um...carry on.  [walks off]
    Bart: Listen to this: [reads] "Unexplainable behavior: individuals
          acting in a secretive fashion are often involved with UFOs or
          other paranormal phenomena, e.g., telephone explosions."
Milhouse: Jeez...if it's in a book, it's _gotta_ be true!

Homer and Abe prepare for a road trip.

  Abe: Hurry up!  We've got a lot of tonic to sell and a lot of towns to
       visit: Frigid Falls, Mount Seldom, Lake Flaccid...
Homer: Great.  I'm going to be stuck in the car all weekend with that
       wheezy windbag.
        [in the car]
  Abe: And that's what's wrong with Bart's generation.  Now as for
       _your_ generation --
Homer: [groaning] Ohh.
-- 

At one of their stops...

  Abe: And for the minimal outlay of one dollar, you can take home a
       bottle of liquid Lothario, distilled Don Juan, catalytically-
       carbonated Cassanova.  Lock old Rover in the shed, 'cause man has
       a new best friend in Simpson &amp; Son's revitalizing tonic.
  Man: I'm not convinced!  I've had bad luck with aphrodisiacs.
  Abe: All question will be answered, all fears will be allayed, with
       one incontrovertible demonstration.  May I have a volunteer from
       the audience?  [points to Homer] Yes, _you_ sir.
       Now, sir, you've never seen me before, is that correct?
Homer: [wooden] That is correct.
  Man: Well then how come his face is on the bottle?
Homer: [pause] Um...
  Abe: [pause] Um...
-- Salesmen stumpers, 

The pair get chased out of town.

       [banjo music plays]
  Abe: You're the worst shill I've ever seen!  You're a disgrace to the
       medicine shill business.
Homer: They didn't start chasing us until you turned on that getaway
       music!

        [pickup full of hillbillies stops and turns around]
-- How to avoid being ridden out of town, 

From his treehouse, through a telescope, Bart observes men chugging the
tonic and running indoors to their female partners.

    Bart: OK, it's not _painfully_ clear the adults are _definitely_
          paving the way for an invasion by the saucer people.
Milhouse: You fool!  Can't you see it's a massive government conspiracy?
          Or have they gotten to you too?
           [he and Bart start wrestling]
    Lisa: Hey!  Hey, hey, stop it!  Stop it!  Why are you guys jumping
          to such ridiculous conclusions?  Haven't you ever heard of
          Occam's Razor?  "The simplest explanation is probably the
          correct one."
    Bart: [condescending] So what's the simplest explanation?
    Lisa: I don't know.  Maybe they're all reverse vampires and they
          have to get home before dark.
Everyone: Aah!  Reverse vampires!  Reverse vampires!
           [Lisa sighs]
-- 

As Homer and Abe continue their drive.  Abe points out an old house in a
field.

  Abe: Hey, wait a minute!  That's Amos Pearson's moose farm.  Make a
       right here.
        [Homer does so; they get out]
Homer: Ew!  Why are we stopping at this dump?
  Abe: That's the house you grew up in, son.
Homer: Wow.  Let's go find that hot dog tree I planted.
  Abe: Yeah, we lived here 'til the bank foreclosed in '63.  Farm went
       bust after the cows started giving sour milk.  Something must
       have spooked 'em good.
        [flashback to young Homer in the barn]
Homer: Nah, stupid cows!  Nyah, nyeah, nyeah nyeah, nyeah!  [flaps
       tongue at them] Boo, boo, boo!  Aah!  Aah!
-- Something, indeed, 

They walk in the front door

  Abe: Oh, memories!  If this old place could talk, it'd say --
        [pulls light cord; ceiling collapses, piles vase, chair,
       toaster, and tricycle on Abe's head]
Homer: Heh heh heh -- [bathtub falls on him]
-- Sticks and stones, 

Both walk into the former living room, bruised and groaning.

         Abe: [points to old TV] There she is, the old Radiation King.
              You'd park yourself right there and watch for hours on
              end.
               [young Homer's shadow is burned into the floor and wall]
               [flashback to Homer watching Kennedy]
     Kennedy: If I may, Helen, I'd like to respond to that question with
              yet another flip remark.
               [reporters laugh, sigh]
       Homer: Wow.  [walks into kitchen] Look at me, er, uh, Mom: I am,
              er, uh, President Kennedy.
Mrs. Simpson: Oh, Abe: maybe our Homer could grow up to be President
              some day.
         Abe: You, President?  This is the greatest country in the
              world.  We've got a whole system set up to prevent people
              like you from ever becoming president.  Quit your
              daydreaming, melonhead!
               [back in the present]
         Abe: Quit your daydreaming, melonhead.
-- The more things change..., 

Homer: Dad, how come you never gave me any encouragement?  Maybe I could
       have been something more than I am.  Like a travel agent, to a
       great scientist, or the inventor of a hilarious refrigerator
       alarm.
  Abe: Who are you to complain?  You locked me up in a home and give me
       the same damn shower safety seat every Christmas.
        [in the car]
Homer: Your whole life you never said one nice thing to me.
  Abe: That's 'cause you're a screw-up.
Homer: _You're_ the screw-up!
  Abe: Why you little -- [strangles Homer]
Homer: All right, all right.  That's it: we're going home!  I'm sick of
       you and your stupid tonic.
  Abe: If I hadn't taken that stupid tonic 38 years ago, you'd have
       never been born and I'd have been happy.  You were an accident!
Homer: [gasps, stops car] Get out.
  Abe: I'm sorry I said that.
Homer: Out.
  Abe: I'm going to get out of the car, and I hope you'll find it in
       your heart not to drive away -- [Homer skids off]
       Well, I'll be all right as long as I can remember my army
       training.
        [that night, Abe still stands there] Dang.
-- The painful truth comes out, 

[End of Act Two.  Time: 15:46]

The doorbell rings.  Homer answers it to find Abe standing there with a
bunch of flowers.  "I'm sorry --" he begins, only to have Homer slam the
door and walk away.  Abe, not to be discouraged, shoves the flowers
through the mail slot and waves through it, "Hi."

Marge: Homey, are you really going to ignore Grampa for the rest of your
       life.
Homer: Of course not, Marge, just for the rest of his life.  He said I
       was an accident...he didn't want to have me.
Marge: You didn't want to have Bart.
Homer: I know, but you're never supposed to _tell_ the child.
Marge: You tell Bart all the time!  You told him this morning.
Homer: [plaintive] But when I do it, it's cute.
-- Double parenting standards, 

In the treehouse, the neighborhood kids try to figure out what's up with
the adults.

    Bart: So finally, we're all in agreement about what's going on with
          the adults.  Milhouse?
Milhouse: [steps up to blackboard] Ahem.  OK, here's what we've got: the
          Rand Corporation, in conjunction with the saucer people --
    Bart: Thank you.
Milhouse: -- under the supervision of the reverse vampires --

          through the looking glass, here, people...
-- A conspiracy theory Oliver Stone would be proud of, "Grampa vs.

Homer talks to his children about the situation with Abe.

       [Bart eats a candy bar]
Homer: Kids, your daddy and his daddy are involved in a very sticky,
       nutty, chewy, chocolatey -- put it away, boy!  -- situation.  And
       your daddy has realized something very important: a father should
       always make his kids feel wanted.  Starting right now I promise
       to spend a lot more time with you and give you the attention you
       deserve.
        [gets up, hugs Bart and Lisa really tight so they can hardly
       breathe]
-- Homer's contract with his kids, 

Abe, meanwhile, continues to try selling the tonic.

   Abe: And just feast your ears on this tantalizing testimonial from my
        own flesh and blood, the son that puts the fun in Simpson &amp; Son,
        my son, Barney!
Barney: [walks out from behind a curtain] I used to be a fat, disgusting
        slob.  [belches]
   Man: That medicine seems to be giving your son a lot of gas.  [HS]
   Abe: I assure you his belching is the result of an unrelated alcohol
        problem.
Barney: Oh -- [collapses]
-- Oh, well that's OK, then, 

Everyone walks away, unimpressed.  "It just ain't the same without
Homer," Abe laments.  "He knew how to drive a car," he continues,
walking to the next town.

Homer, meanwhile, has Maggie strapped to his chest.  He eats potato
chips, the crumbs showering his younger daughter.

Homer: Son...my dear son, from now I'm going to be a good and attentive
       father.  And for starters, your old man is going to teach you how
       to ride your very first bike.
        [brings out a girl's bike; starts riding it; it breaks]
 Bart: Number one, I know how to ride a bike.
       Number two, I already own a bike.
       And number three, _that_ is a girl's bike.
Homer: You're no girl, you're a boy.  A good boy.  You can be President
       -- scratch that, you _will_ be President!
-- Grand aspirations, 

Off-camera, Lisa calls "Daaad!"

Homer: I think Lisa needs another push on her new tire swing!
 Lisa: No, Dad, I want to get down.  This tire is filthy and the steel
       belts are poking me.
Homer: [pushing her] Whee!  Whee!
 Lisa: Nooo!  Nooo!
 Bart: No offense, Homer, but your half-assed underparenting was a lot
       more fun than your half-assed overparenting.
Homer: But I'm using my whole ass.
 Lisa: Dad, it's just that too much of your love can really be...scary.
Homer: [sighs] Some day you'll thank me for all this scary love.  But
       now I've got to go somewhere and do some serious thinking.
        [gets into car, drives off]
 Bart: I'm sure he meant to say, "serious drinking".
 Lisa: That's what I assumed.
-- His kids know him well, 

He goes back to the old house where he was born and walks in.  "Here's
where it all started to go wrong," he laments.  "How am I supposed to be
a good dad when I never had one myself?"  He kicks the wall, dislodging
an old book from a shelf.  It falls open to reveal a photo of young
Homer greeting Santa Claus on Christmas morning.  He strikes a match and
examines it.  "Oh, Dad wasn't even around on Christmas morning when I
actually got to meet Santa Claus.  Some father...wait a minute!"  He
looks more closely at Santa and realizes it was Abe dressed up.  "Aw,
this photo is a blessing.  It eases my pain."  But the match he's
holding makes the photo catch fire.  He tosses it away, screaming, as
fire spreads around the room.

Meanwhile, in another room of the same house, Abe stands in front of the
fireplace (which has a fire burning in it).  "This tonic's caused me
nothing but trouble," he observes.  "You've done all the damage you're
going to do!" he cries, throwing the bottle on the fire.  It explodes,
spraying rings of fire everywhere.  Abe runs out, yelling.  Homer, too,
runs out of the house, and the two collide on the front porch.

Homer: Dad!
  Abe: Son!
Homer: I'm a screw-up.  I burned down our house.
  Abe: No, I'm a screw-up.  _I_ burned down our house.
Homer: You know what?
  Abe: What?
Homer: We're _both_ screw-ups.
  Abe: It doesn't matter.  What matters is, you were right when you told
       me I never said anything nice about you.
Homer: [fearful] So...are you going to say something nice now?
  Abe: Well I hadn't thought _that_ far ahead.  [pause] Oh, OK, here it
       goes: I'm not sorry I had you, son.  I was always proud...that
       you weren't a short man.
Homer: Aw, Dad!
        [they hug as the house roof caves in]
  Abe: What do you say we roll on the grass, Son?
Homer: I'm with you, Dad.
        [they roll around, shouting, trying to extinguish the flames on
       their clothes]
-- All's well that ends well, 

[End of Act Three.  Time: 20:58]
 EPISODE TITLE: Fear of Flying


EPISODE SUMMARY: 
(Frederic Briere says there were no syndication cuts in this episode.)

At Moe's Tavern, the regulars sit around the bar.

 Lenny: Hey, Moe...you got change for a five?
   Moe: Yeah, sure thing Lenny.
         [opens cash register]
         [a cobra pops out and bites him repeatedly]
        A snake in the cash register!  [everyone laughs]
        Great prank, fellas, great prank.  Oh, I'm gonna be sick
        tonight.
Barney: Hey Moe, you want to smell my flower?
   Moe: _Do_ I?!  [walks over]
         [Barney holds a lighter under Moe's chest]
        Ooh!  I'm burning up here.  Ooh!  [everyone laughs]
        Aw, taking advantage of my alcohol-soaked clothes.  Ho, ho, it's
        funny _and_ it makes you think.  Oh, I need some coffee before I
        pass out.  Homer, pass me the sugar.
 Homer: [unscrewing lid] This is going to be great!
         [Moe pours sugar in his cup; a whole lot comes out]
Barney: Oh, jeez.
   Moe: Aw, there's sugar all over the bar now.
 Lenny: That's not funny, Homer.
Barney: Yeah!  We were just messing around, and you had to go too far.
-- The subtleties of pranks, 

     Moe: How many people want Homer banned from this place for life?
Everyone: Yeah!
   Homer: Aw, come on, everybody.  This bar is like a tavern to me.
     Moe: Sorry, Homer, you should have thought of that before you gave
          me the old sugar-me-do.  I'm taking your caricature down from
          Mount Lushmore [does so] and I'm taking your favorite song out
          of the juke box.
   Homer: [gasps] "It's Raining Men"?
     Moe: Yeah, not no more it ain't.
           [tosses it out like a frisbee]
           [it hits Smithers, who's driving a car]
Smithers: Ow!  [checks title] Ooh!
           [Homer gets tossed out]
   Homer: Oh.  Heh heh heh, joke's on them: I'm still alive.
-- Homer "Eddie Vedder" Simpson, 

Bart tries to console his father.

 Bart: Cheer up, Homer.
Homer: Can't.
 Bart: [happily] OK.
Marge: What if you pretended that this couch were a bar?  Then you could
       spend more nights at home with us.  Huh?
Homer: I'm not going to dignify that with an answer.
 Lisa: Look on the bright side, Dad.  Did you know that the Chinese use
       the same word for "crisis" as they do for "opportunity"?
Homer: Yes!  Cris-atunity.
-- Something like that, anyway, 

Homer: You're right.  I've been wasting my life away in that dump for
       years.  That's it!  I'm going to find a _new_ bar to drink in,
       and I'm going to get drunker than I've ever been in my entire
       life!  Bart!  Where's my wallet?
 Bart: [pulling it from his own pocket] Right here, Dad!
Homer: Thank you!
-- Homer gives up Moe's Tavern, 

The first place Homer goes looks high-priced.

    Homer: Wow, classy.
Maitre D': Good evening, sir.  Would you please leave without a fuss
           right now?
    Homer: [meek] OK.
-- Homer's search for a new bar begins, 

As Homer walks to the next bar, a snatch of Cheers-esque music plays.

Homer: Ooh, this looks like a nice friendly place.
Carla: Sammy, you're too old to go on a date with two twins on the same
       night you're supposed to marry Diane without Rebecca knowing.
  Sam: OK, Carla, I'll make you a bet: if this affects my major league
       comeback, I'll sell my bar.
 Norm: Woody...gimme a beer.
Woody: I think you've had enough, Mr. Peterson.  My chiropractor says I
       can't carry you home any more.
 Norm: Just gimme another beer, you brain-dead hick!  [grabs wine
       bottle, smashes it, holds it by the neck]
       I'll kill you!  I'll kill all of you!
Cliff: [restraining him] Whoa, settle down, Normy.  Gotta save those
       pipes for Karaoke.
Homer: [gasps] Whoa!  [runs out]
 Norm: I love you guys...[weeps]
-- You wanna go where everybody knows their character, 

The next bar Homer tries has two female zodiacal symbols interlocking on
the sign above the door.

Homer: Wait a minute...there's something bothering me about this place.
       [looks around] I know!  This lesbian bar doesn't have a fire
       exit.  Enjoy your death trap, ladies.  [leaves]
Woman: What was her problem?
-- Homer at the "She-She Club", 

Back at Moe's Tavern, a man in a top hat with a mustache walks in.  He
looks and sounds like Homer, only he has a British accent.

  Guy: Greetings, good men.  Might I trouble you for a drink?
  Moe: Oh, get out of here, Homer.
  Guy: Homer?  Who is Homer?  My name is Guy Incognito.
        [he gets beaten up and tossed out, unconscious]
Homer: [walks up, looks at Guy] [gasps] Oh my God!  This man is my exact
       double.  [gasps] Oh my God!  That dog has a puffy tail!
        [he chases it, giggling] Here, Puff!  Here, Puff!
-- A great moment passes Homer by, 

Homer's quest takes him to the airport.

        Homer: The last bar in Springfield...if they don't let me in
               here, I'm going to have to quit drinking!
Homer's liver: Yay!
        Homer: Shut up, liver!  [punches it] Ow!  My liver hurts...
                [walks in] I'd like a beer, please.
    Bartender: Uh, sorry, you gotta be a pilot to drink in here.
        Homer: Um, but I _am_ a pilot.
    Bartender: Where's your uniform?
        Homer: Um...I stowed it safely in the overhead compartment.
    Bartender: Well, you talk the talk.  Here's a loaner.  [gives him a
               uniform]
-- Homer in "The Little Black Box", 

A man bursts in, breathless.

  Man: We need a pilot, pronto!  Who wants to fly to the Windy City?
        [pilots all go, "Oh, I'll go!", "Me", "I'm your man", etc.]
  Man: Conditions are a little windy.
        [pilots all go, "Well", "I dunno", "Never mind", etc.]
  Man: [to Homer] You!
Homer: [now dressed as a pilot] But I --
  Man: Hey...you're not just impersonating a pilot so you can drink
       here, are you?
Homer: Yeah.  That's exactly why I'm here.
  Man: [laughs] You fly boys, you crack me up.
Homer: [being pushed into the cockpit] But I keep telling you I'm not a
       pilot!
  Man: And I keep telling you you fly boys crack me up!
-- 

 Alan: Hi, I'm Alan.  I'm your copilot.
Homer: Uh, yeah, uh, hmm.  Er, uh, as a change of pace, I'm going to let
       you do most of the work.  I think you're ready for it, Alan.
        [Alan makes a face]
       And, um, I'll just get us started.
        [flips a switch randomly]
 Alan: Uh, we'll need that to live.
        [Homer flips another switch; the wheels retract and the plane
       smashes into the runway]
-- Homer, involuntary pilot, 

A senior airline official talks to Homer in his office.

Official: If word gets out about this, Krazy Klown Airlines will be a
          laughingstock.  In exchange for your silence, I'm prepared to
          offer your family free tickets to anywhere in the United
          States.  Excluding Alaska and Hawaii, the freak states.
   Homer: Woo hoo!
           [at home]
          Good news, everybody!  Because I endangered lives, we can fly
          anywhere we want!
    Bart: Alaska!
    Lisa: Hawaii!
-- Well, _almost_ anywhere, 

Marge seems less than keen.

Marge: Er, I don't know, Homer.  We're right in the middle of the busy
       housekeeping season.
Homer: But Marge, you deserve a vacation.  It's a chance for you to
       clean up after us in a whole other state!
Marge: I don't want to be a wet blanket, but getting on a plane like
       that seems like a hassle coupled with a burden.
Homer: Come on, Marge, I want to shake off the dust of this one-horse
       town.  I want to explore the world.  I want to watch TV in a
       different time zone.  I want to visit strange, exotic malls.  I'm
       sick of eating hoagies.  I want a grinder, a sub, a foot-long
       hero...I want to _live_, Marge!  Won't you let me _live_?  Won't
       you please?!
-- Passionate pleas, 

So Marge, of course, gives in.  Homer chomps peanuts contentedly.

Homer: So, Marge, pretty sweet, eh?
Marge: Hmm.  Oh, I forgot to clean the lint basket in the dryer.  If
       someone broke into the house and did laundry, it could start a
       fire.
        [a baby starts crying]
 Bart: Oh, great.  I specifically asked not to be seated next to a baby.
        [camera pulls back to reveal Maggie crying]
  Abe: [looking out window] Wow...we must be _really_ flying high!
       Those people down there look all tiny and blurry...just like the
       inside of a cataract.
-- Conversation while the plane is on the ground, 

Stewardess: [over PA] Attention passengers.  Due to our policy of
            overselling flights, this flight has been oversold.  In
            accordance with FAA rules, the first two people to the front
            will be upgraded to first class.
             [everyone rushes madly; Bart and Lisa climb over everyone]
Stewardess: OK, you two!
      Lisa: Come on, Bart!  They're going to pamper us!
      Bart: [gasps]
      Lisa: Not _literally_, of course.
             [in first class, someone fills Bart's martini glass with
            milk]
      Bart: I come for the service, [sigh] but I stay for the leg room.
             [Lisa roasts marshmallows over a mini-fire on her tray]
-- 

The pilot announces, "Flight crew, prepare for takeoff."  Marge starts
hyperventilating and shredding a napkin.  When the seatbelt sign comes
on, she panics.

Marge: [panicked] I think I'll go get a picture of the plane taking off.
       [struggles with her seat belt]
Homer: Marge, what's wrong?  Are you hungry?  Sleepy?  Gassy?  Is it
       gas?  It's gas, isn't it?
Marge: Homer, I've never told you this before, but I'm not a good flyer.
       [pants, gasps] I have to get off the plane.  Let me off the
       plane.  [stands up] I'm asking you nicely to open the doors!
Homer: Take it easy, Marge.  How about if we dope you up real good?
Marge: [screaming] Let me off let me off let me off let me off let me
       off let me off -- [runs up and down the aisle]
        [the plane takes off as the family watches]
Homer: It's OK, Marge.  We don't need to go on a trip; we'll just wait
       for the killer bees to come to us.
-- Homer, consoling, 

[End of Act One.  Time: 8:33]

The family unpack their suitcases at home.

 Bart: You know, I have this feeling that we forgot something...
  Abe: [still on the plane] Aaaaah!
Homer: Ehh, I'm sure it's nothing.
 Lisa: Mom, are you feeling any better?
Marge: Yes, but I'd rather not talk about it.
Homer: Permit _me_ to solve the mystery: your mother has a fear of
       flying.
 Bart: So much for the days when I could say, "At least my _mother_'s
       normal."
Marge: Well, everybody's got a fear of something.
Homer: Not everybody.
Marge: [to Homer] Sock puppets!
Homer: Where?!  Where?!  Aah!  Aah!
 Lisa: Mom, are you _sure_ you don't want to discuss it?
Marge: Sure as sugar...[laughs awkwardly]
-- No dysfunctionality here, 

Homer: Lisa, the important thing is for your mother to repress what
       happened.  Push it deep down inside her, so she'll never annoy us
       again.
 Lisa: But if we don't encourage her to vent her feelings, they can come
       out in other ways.
Marge: I just realized we never had a wedding for the cat and the dog...
       they've been living in sin!
        [the pets whimper]
-- Not with each other, but..., 

The kitchen table is covered with lavishly prepared food.  Marge stands
in front of the stove, three boiling pots on the go.  The rest of the
family walks to the kitchen door.

 Lisa: Mom, you've been cooking all night?
Marge: [happy] Judge, jury, and executioner, all rolled into one, you
       are!
 Lisa: See, Dad, I told you Mom would have problems.
Marge: No, no, honey, it's all right.  Really, I'm fine, I'm all right.
       Mother always said, "Don't complain.  Be good.  Behave.  Behave.
       Be nice.  Smile.  Be polite.  Don't wink..." [walks out]
Homer: You heard your mother's ramblings.  She's fine, so behave.
-- Homer, attuned to Marge's needs, 

That night, in bed, Homer is awakened by hammering.  He rolls over, sees
Marge isn't there, goes to the window, and opens it.

Homer: Marge, it's 3 a.m.!  Shouldn't you be baking?
Marge: In a little while.
-- Marge hammers shingles at night, 

The next day, as Marge sits on the couch, the family approaches her.

 Lisa: Mom, can we talk to you?
Marge: Can't talk.  Keeping myself in a state of catlike readiness.
 Lisa: Uh, neat.
-- 

   Lisa: Anyway, Mom, maybe you should go into therapy.
  Marge: No, I don't need therapy, I'm fine.  And it's too expensive.
  Homer: And I don't believe in it!  It breaks up families, turns wives
         against husbands, children against fathers, neighbors against
         me.  You don't have to pay some fancy psychiatrist ten bucks an
         hour to get top-notch therapy.
          [at KBBL]
Psychic: Hello, "Radio Psychic".  You will die a terrible, terrible
         death.
  Marge: [on the phone] [gasps]
Psychic: Ooh, I'm sorry!  That was our last caller.  OK, I'm getting
         something now.  Hmm.  OK, you will die a terrible, terrible
         death.
  Marge: But I --
     DJ: Thank you for calling "Radio Psychic".  Do you have a song
         request?
  Homer: [running to the phone] "It's Raining Men"!
-- Homer "Waylon" Simpson, 

At the VHS Village, Homer chooses some videos to help Marge out.

   Homer: Now Marge, "Dear Abby" says seeing films about air travel can
          calm your fears.  Ooh!  Here are some upbeat titles: "Hero",
          "Fearless"..."Alive!"
           [at home, Marge watches them]
   Man 1: No thanks to the plane, many of us are still...
Everyone: Alive!
   Man 2: [through full mouth] We certainly are.  [chews]
   Man 3: Pass me another hunk of copilot.
    Lisa: Dad, Mom's getting worse.  You have to take her to see a real
          psychiatrist.  Look how tense she is!
   Homer: She's fine!
           [camera shows Marge sitting on air]
          Oh.
-- Rigid, not tense, 

The family take her to a psychiatrist the next day.

Homer: [sarcastic] All right, Lisa, you got your way.  Your Mom's going
       to a psychiatrist.  She's going to tell Marge to leave me.  It'll
       break up the family and you'll have to live with your grandmother
       and pick beans.
 Lisa: Dad, I like picking beans with Gramma.
Homer: Well, keep it up, then.
 Lisa: [sarcastic] OK, I will.
Homer: Good.  You do that.
 Lisa: Fine.
Homer: You'll be picking many a bean.
 Lisa: Hope I do.
-- Homer gives his kids sarcasm lessons, 

Bart espies Principal Skinner reading a "Principal's World" magazine.

   Bart: I don't believe it!  Principal Skinner.  Well, well, well, I
         never thought I'd win _this_ easy.
Skinner: Hmph.  This has nothing to do with you, Simpson.  I have many,
         many issues with my beloved smother -- mother.
  Homer: Bart, leave that man alone with his pain and sit down.
   Bart: [abashed] OK.
          [Homer laughs at Skinner, makes crazy noises at him]
-- Homer, sensitive to mental illness, 

Homer and Marge meet the psychiatrist.

Homer: All right, how much do you charge?
Zweig: If money's a problem, I charge on a sliding scale.  I can go as
       low as $30 an hour.
Homer: Keep sliding.
Marge: $30 will be fine.
Homer: Whoa, whoa whoa whoa whoa!  First, what are your qualifications?
Zweig: Well -- [she motions to a wall of diplomas]
Homer: Oh, no.  I'm not here to take a reading test.  I want to see some
       credentials.
Marge: Mph, I'm sorry, Doctor, he's just afraid you'll blame all my
       problems on him.
Zweig: I'm not here to blame anyone.
        [she double-underlines "Husband" on a pad of paper]
-- The first meeting with Dr. Zweig, 

Zweig: Marge, therapy can be an intense process.
Marge: Uh huh...
Zweig: We're going to delve deeply into your subconscious and we're not
       going to stop until we've exposed the root of your fear of
       flying.
Marge: Mmm...
Zweig: Don't worry.  This is a private sanctuary where whatever
       transpires will be just between us.
        [Homer, dressed as a window washer, appears at the window]
Marge: Huh?
Zweig: Oh, that's just Murray the window washer.  He comes every day at
       12:00.
Marge: But it's a few seconds before 12:00.
        [Murray drops down on Homer, knocking him off]
-- Marge's first session, 

[End of Act Two.  Time: 13:30]

Marge comes out of a therapy session to be greeted by Homer.

Homer: Ever since you started therapy, all you can do is talk about
       yourself.  Well what about _me_, Marge?
Marge: I just left my first session and I haven't even opened my mouth
       yet!
Homer: You see?  You see?  "_I_ just left _my_ first session and _I_
       haven't opened _my_ mouth yet".
-- Homer traps Marge, 

At Marge's next session...

Zweig: Marge, there's no simple explanation for your .
       But it can probably be traced to some childhood trauma.  Think
       back...what's the earliest memory you have of something bad
       happening?
Marge: Hmm...that would have to be my first day of school.
        [flashback]
Patty: They got this thing called a "fire drill".  They use it to drill
       a flaming hole in your head.
Marge: Mmm...
Selma: And there's only one big toilet, and they make you all go at the
       same time.  [laughs]
-- The sensitive Bouvier twins, 

Marge: [voice over] The kids at school were even worse.
        [young Marge gets on the bus, sits next to a girl]
 Girl: [seeing her lunch pail] Ew!  You like the Monkees?  You _know_
       they don't write their own songs.
Marge: They do so!
 Girl: They don't even play their own instruments.
Marge: No...no!
 Girl: That's not even Michael Nesmith's real hat.
Marge: Aah!
        [back in the present]
Zweig: Kids can be so cruel.
Marge: But it's true.  They didn't write their own songs _or_ play their
       own instruments.
Zweig: The Monkees weren't about music, Marge.  They were about
       rebellion, about political and social upheaval!
        [Marge smiles, relieved]
-- Dr. Zweig does her job, 

The family watches TV that night.

Homer: [sullen] Did you talk about me in therapy today?
Marge: I don't think so.
Homer: Tell me the truth!  [gasps] Don't tell her I raised my voice.
       [laughs nervously] Happy family, happy family...
-- 

In the next therapy session...

Marge: I keep having the same dream.  I'm the mother from "Lost in
       Space".
        [scene shift to Marge's dream]
Marge: Ready for breakfast, Dr. Smith?
Homer: Oh, being stuck on this godforsaken planet has vanquished what
       little appetite I have.  [sits down, mows down]
 Lisa: [as a robot] Warning.  Warning.  Dr. Smith refuses to do his
       astrochores.
Homer: Why, you clattering clank of cogs and -- my fair lady, as you
       well know, my back is a disaster area.  Oh, the pain.  Oh, the
       pain of it all!
 Lisa: Danger.  Danger.  My hook are flailing wildly.
        [a rocket takes off]
Marge: Wait!  Wait, Daddy, please don't leave.  Take me with you!
        [back to the office]
Zweig: Marge, are you aware you just said "Please don't leave" to your
       daddy?
Marge: No I didn't.
Zweig: Yes you did.  And you also infringed on any number of copyrights.
-- Dr. Zweig, psychiatric lawyer, 

Zweig: Now...let's talk about your father.
Marge: [hurried] Sure.  OK, I'll talk about father...Father Christmas.
       That's what they call Santa Claus in England.  They drive on the
       wrong side of the road there.  Now _that's_ crazy.  [laughs
       nervously] People are always saying how small England is but you
       couldn't fit it all in here, not by a long shot.  [laughs again]
       You know what?  I'm cured.  [gets up to leave]
Zweig: Marge, get back here and tell me about your father.
Marge: OK.  OK, but you're going to make a big deal out of this.  He was
       a pilot.
Zweig: A pilot?!  This _is_ a big deal.
Marge: You see?
-- Self-fulfilling prophecies., 

Dr. Zweig laughs nervously.

Zweig: Er, Marge, this may not be the best time to bring this up, but,
       uh, your last check bounced.
Marge: Wait, I'm remembering something.
Zweig: Yes, Marge, there's still the matter of --
Marge: I was a little girl...
        [flashback to Marge holding Daddy's hand]
Daddy: Goodbye, Margie.  Be a good girl, now.  [gets on plane]
Marge: Why does Daddy have to leave?
Mommy: Because he's a pilot.  He flies all over the world.
Marge: I want to see Daddy fly.  [runs up plane steps]
Mommy: Margie!  No, come back!
        [Marge gets inside, looks around]
Marge: Daddy?  Daddy, where are --
Daddy: [a steward] So, who wants pre-flight cookie?  Fig Newtons?
       Hydrox?
Marge: Daddy?  Aah!
Daddy: Don't look at me.  Don't look at me!
-- The shameful truth comes out, 

Back in the present...

Marge: [weeping] My father was a stewardess!
Zweig: Marge, there's nothing to be ashamed of here.  Today, male flight
       attendants or "stewards" are common.
Marge: They are?
Zweig: Yes, thanks to trailblazers like your father.  You might say he
       was a pioneer.
Marge: Yeah...you might even say he was an American hero.
Zweig: Let's not go nuts.
-- Too late, 

Dr. Zweig concludes, "The important thing is that we've pinpointed the
precise moment when you developed your ."  But Marge
starts remembering some other stuff.  As a baby, she remembers her
grandmother trying to feed her with a spoon, saying "Here comes the
airplane" but taking a long time to put the spoon in baby's mouth.  As a
young girl, a toy plane she was riding in caught fire.  Her mother takes
her to a cornfield once, when a biplane swoops down and fires its
machine guns at her.

Marge: Do you think those things could also have contributed to my fear
       of flying?
Zweig: [brusque] Yes, yes, it's all a rich tapestry.
Marge: Oh, well, thank you doctor.  You've changed my life!
Zweig: You know, Marge, we've really just begun to scratch the surface.
       There's still the far more serious problem of your husband.
Homer: [walking in] That's OK, you don't have to make her into some kind
       of superwoman.  She can get on a plane, that's plenty.  [rushes
       Marge out]
Marge: Thank you, doctor.  Whenever the wind whistles through the
       leaves, I'll think "Lowenstein", "Lowenstein".
Zweig: My name is Zweig.
Marge: [whispering] Lowenstein...
-- Marge the old honeydripper, 

The family finally get on a plane together.

Homer: Don't worry about a thing, honey.  I'm going to help you through
       this.
        [he and Marge sit down; some noises occur]
       Those are all normal noises.  Luggage compartment closing...cross
       checking...just sit back and relax.
        [shot from outside the plane]
       That's just the engine powering up...that's just the engine
       struggling...
        [the plane drives off the runway into a swamp]
       That's just a carp swimming around your ankles...
Marge: Mmm...
-- Not much help allaying those fears, 

[End of Act Three.  Time: 19:50]
 EPISODE TITLE: Homer the Great


EPISODE SUMMARY: 
[Syndication cuts are marked in curly braces "{}" and are courtesy of
Frederic Briere.]

The scene opens on the Stern Lecture Plumbing van ("I told you not to
flush that"), then focuses on the Simpsons' basement window.  A plumber
stands in a foot of water in front of a leaky pipe.

Plumber: Looks like you got a leak.
  Marge: Could you start fixing it pretty soon?  The basement is getting
         awfully flooded.  And I think the cat's down there.
          [Snowball II meows balefully from underwater]
Plumber: Yeah, I probably won't be able to get the parts I need for two,
         three weeks and that's if I order them today -- which I won't.
  Marge: Oh, dear.
          [his pager beeps; he looks, it shows "Low Battery"]
Plumber: Hmm, emergency call.  Gotta go.  [starts to leave]
  Homer: What should we do until you get back?
Plumber: Ehh, put a pan down there.
          [Homer puts one down; it floats away]
  Homer: Aw, it didn't work!
-- A good use of $75/hour, 

On Homer's way to work, he gets stuck behind a huge lineup of cars on
the freeway.

Homer: Lousy traffic jams...[laughs] the traffic report will get me out
       of this one.
        [turns on KBBL]
Arnie: [from a helicopter] This is Arnie Pie!  Looks like we got a
       little accident that's backing traffic up as far as this reporter
       can see.
        [camera pulls back; the helicopter is causing the jam]
-- At least he's not lying, 

Homer arrives at work quite late and pulls into the last available spot,
right on the end of a row.  From the other side of a fence, Bart waves
to him from his bedroom window: "Hi Dad!"  Homer makes dismissive noises
and walks towards the power plant entrance.  As he gets close, Lenny and
Carl pull up in their cars into parking spots right at the entrance.
"Hey," asks Homer suspiciously, "how come you guys got such great
parking places?"  Lenny answers quietly, "It's a secret."  Carl tells
him "Shh!  Shut up!"

Homer walks to his station at work and sits on his chair, which promptly
collapses.  He looks at the bottom of the stool, which reads "Econo-save
budget stool: Factory Second".  "All right, Econo-save, you just made
the list!"  Homer says menacingly, pulling out "Homer's Revenge List"
and adding "Econo Save" to the end.

He walks into the room where Carl and Lenny work and asks, "Hey!  Will
you guys help me fix my -- " but stops when he sees them sitting in big,
comfortable, vibrating chairs with their names on them.  "Hey...how come
you guys got better chairs than me."  Lenny answers him again, "It's a
secret!" and again Carl warns, "Shh!  Shut up!"

At the soda machine, Lenny presses a ring with a special pattern onto it
into a special place on the machine and gets a soda without paying for
it.  Homer walks up, starts putting change in some change, and asks the
boys if they want to go bowling tonight.  "Naw, we're busy," replies
Lenny, and Carl adds, "Yeah, we got, er, things to do."  "Like what?"
asks Homer, slyly.  "Uh, it's a secret," says Lenny for the third time.
Carl, in the middle of drinking, stops and eyes Lenny, leaving Homer to
say, "Shut up!"

At dinner, Homer tells the family about his day.

Homer: So anyway, Lenny and Carl are never around on Wednesdays and they
       don't tell me where they go.  It's like a conspiracy.
 Bart: A conspiracy, eh?  You think they might be involved in the
       Kennedy assassination in some way?
Homer: I do...now.  Anyway, I'm going to follow them tonight and see
       where they go.
Marge: Oh, Homer, don't start stalking people again.  It's so _illegal_.
       Remember when you were stalking Charles Kuralt because you
       thought he dug up your garden?
Homer: Well, something did!
Marge: I don't want you stalking anyone tonight.
Homer: Oh, OK, have it your own way, Marge.  I'll be back in a minute
       [gets up]: I'm...[sly] going outside.  To..._stalk_...Lenny and
       Carl.  [realizes] D'oh!
-- Homer has a garden?, 

Homer's head pops up from some bushes, then disappears again.  He
tiptoes up to Lenny's car, attaches a can of yellow paint to the trailer
hitch, pokes a hole in the bottom of it, then jumps out of sight just in
time as Lenny and Carl get in and drive off.  "Heh heh heh, all I have
to do is follow the yellow drip road," Homer chuckles.

The pair stop in front of a strange-looking building.  Homer's mouth
opens wide in amazement.  Getting out, Lenny asserts, "There's our
secret meeting place."  Carl agrees, "Yes.  Let's go inside."  "Sounds
good," answers Lenny, and the two walk in.  A large man in a strange
robe guards the door menacingly.  Homer walks up innocently, humming,
and when the man blocks his entrance, he turns around quickly, still
humming.

Inside, a large open hall is filled with men all wearing the same odd
robes.  Homer, not deterred, is sprawled over the glass-dome skylight.

  Homer: [giggles] I can see everything and they're none the wiser!
          [the glass starts to crack, then it breaks and he falls in]
    Moe: An intruder!
Skinner: He will pay the ultimate price.
Hibbert: Yes...the ultimate price.
    Moe: Get outta here!  [tosses him out the front door]
-- "Ultimate" is relative, 

At work the next day, Homer confronts his two chums.

Homer: I saw weird stuff in that place last night.  Weird, strange,
       sick, twisted, eerie, godless, evil stuff!  And I want in.
 Carl: We don't, uh, know what you're talking about, Homer.
Lenny: And you can't join the Stonecutters because it's too exclusive!
 Carl: [sighs] Well, it was a real nice secret organization we had once.
-- And he'll tell two friends, and so on..., 

Homer: Stonecutters, eh?  How do I join?
Lenny: There are only two ways to gain membership: be the son of a
       Stonecutter --
Homer: Next?
Lenny: -- or, save the life of a Stonecutter.
        [starts to eat a sandwich]
Homer: Hey!  [grabs it, stomps on it]
       I saved your life!  That egg sandwich could have killed you by
       cholesterol.
Lenny: Pfft, forget it, Homer.  While it has been established that eggs
       contain cholesterol, it has not yet been proven conclusively that
       they actually raise the level of serum cholesterol in the human
       blood stream.
Homer: So one of those Egg Council creeps got to you too, huh?
Lenny: Aw, you've got it all wrong, Homer.  It's not like that.
        [a man in an egg costume creeps, then runs, away]
Homer: You'd better run, egg!
-- The insidious Egg Council, 

Homer whines to Marge in bed.

   Homer: Why don't people like me, Marge?
   Marge: Mmm, everyone likes you, you're a wonderful person.
   Homer: Why don't those stupid idiots let me in their crappy club for
          jerks?
   Marge: I'm sure it's nothing personal, Homer.
   Homer: It is.  It's been happening to me all my life.
           [flashback to kids climbing into a treefort]
     Boy: Hey Billy!  Hey Joey!  Come on in.  There's plenty of room.
          Sorry, not you, Homer.
   Homer: Why not?
           [boy points to sign, "No Homers Club"]
          But you let in Homer Glumplich.
Homer G.: [pops head out window] Hyuck hyuck!
     Boy: It says no Homer_s_.  We're allowed to have one.
   Homer: Oh...
           [back to the present]
   Homer: I felt so left out.
   Marge: Kids can be so cruel.
    Bart: [walking by] We can?  Thanks, Mom!
    Lisa: [from another room] Ow!  Cut it out, Bart!
-- A license to ill, 

Homer continues to mope the next day at dinner.

Homer: I'd give anything to get into the Stonecutters.
 Lisa: What do they do there, Dad?
  Abe: I'm a member --
Homer: What do they do?  What _don't_ they do?  [laughs] Oh, they do so
       many things they never stop.  Oh, the things they do there, my
       stars.
 Lisa: You don't know _what_ they do there, do you?
Homer: Not as such, no.
  Abe: I'm a Stonecutter --
 Bart: Dad, remember those self-hypnosis courses we took to help us
       ignore Grampa?
Homer: Do I ever!  It's five years later and I _still_ think I'm a
       chicken.  I'm a chicken, Marge!
Marge: I know, I know.
 Bart: Maybe we should be listening to him now.
-- Bart, the voice of reason, 

  Abe: I'm a member!
Homer: Huh?
  Abe: What?
Homer: What?
  Abe: Huh?
 Lisa: You're a member of the Stonecutters, Grampa?
  Abe: Oh, sure.  Let's see...[pulls out wallet, starts going through
       it] I'm an elk, a Mason, a communist.  I'm the president of the
       Gay and Lesbian Alliance for some reason...ah, here it is.  The
       Stonecutters.
Homer: This is it!  My ticket in: they have to let me in if I'm the son
       of a member.  I'll take this communist one too.  [walks out]
-- McCarthy, no Springfieldian he, 

Homer drags Abe into the next meeting.

Homer: Coming through!  Can't throw me out, my father's a member.  I'm
       in, I'm in.
Lenny: OK, OK, Homer, you're in.  Just don't point that..._thing_ at me.
Homer: [pushes Grampa over] Aw, thanks, Lenny.  When am I going to be
       initiated?
 Carl: As soon as Number One gets here.
Homer: [scoffing] Number One?  Heh heh, what kind of stupid weiner name
       is that?  [dumb voice] Hello, my name is Number One.  Hee hee...
       [tiring of it] and so forth.
-- Mockery has its day, 

Lenny: We call each other by number, not by name.  Carl is Number
       Fourteen, I'm Number Twelve.  Burnsie's Number 29.
Homer: [incredulous] _You_ outrank Mr. Burns here?
Lenny: Sure.  Watch -- hey, 29, get over here!
        [Burns walks over; Lenny pinches his nose]
Burns: [shudders] Thank you, Sir.  May I have another?
        [Lenny kicks him in the butt; he falls over]
        [ominous] Patience, Monty...climb the ladder.
-- The sword of Damocles returns, 

An man walks out from behind the curtain on stage and stands behind the
podium.

Homer: Is he the leader?
  Moe: Of this chapter.  There are chapters all over the world.  And, it
       has been foretold that some day, a Chosen One will --
Homer: OK, OK, I didn't ask for your life story.
-- Homer the sympathetic listener, 

The blindfolded Homer is led to the front of the stage by Moe.

      Carl: Let the initiation begin.
Number One: All Stonecutters must take the Leap of Faith.  If you
            survive this five-story plunge, your character will be
            proven.
             [Homer whimpers]
       Moe: Happy landings!  [pushes him]
             [Homer falls two feet onto the floor; everyone laughs]
             [the floor collapses and Homer falls through with a yell
            and a crash -- five times consecutively]
     Homer: [from the bottom] I think I have to do it again.  My
            blindfold came off.
-- Playing by the rules, 

Number One leads the blindfolded Homer to the next test.

Number One: This ritual is called...Crossing the Desert.
             [Homer gets paddled on the butt by Hibbert, Skinner,
            Brockman, Krusty, Moe, Quimby, and Willy in succession]
Number One: And this, we call the Unblinking Eye.
             [he gets paddled by the same people in reverse order]
     Homer: Hey...have you ever noticed that the Crossing the Desert is
            a lot like the Unblinking Eye.  And it's _exactly_ like the
            Wreck of the Hesperus.
Number One: And now, the final ordeal: the Paddling of the Swollen
            Ass...With Paddles.
-- Homer's initiation continues, 

At last, Homer takes the final oath.

     Homer: And by the sacred parchment, I swear that if I reveal the
            secrets of the Stonecutters, may my stomach become bloated
            and my head be plucked of all but three hairs --
       Moe: Um, I think he should have to take a different oath.
Number One: Everyone takes the same oath.  Welcome to the club, Number
            908.  You have joined the Sacred Order of the Stonecutters
            who, since ancient times, have split the rocks of ignorance
            that obscure the light of knowledge and truth.  Now let's
            all get drunk and play ping pong!
  Everyone: Yay!
       Moe: 'Cause he's already kind of heavy, you know, and --
-- Moe, who's never been on safari, 

[End of Act One.  Time: 9:04]

Back in the Simpson basement, the pipe is still leaking.

Plumber: Well, to be honest, I never got around to ordering that part
         for you, so, uh, it's still going to be a couple of weeks.
  Homer: [sly] Oh, really?
Plumber: Yes...
  Homer: Really?
Plumber: Yes, yes.
  Homer: But what if I were to shake your hand in _this_ wise?
          [he and the plumber do a ridiculous handshake and pull up
         their shirts to reveal Stonecutters T-shirts]
Plumber: Whoa, I didn't realize you were a member!
          [fixes the pipe with one twist, fishes Snowball II out of the
         water]
-- Membership has its privileges[tm], 

On the way to work, Homer finds himself in a huge traffic jam again.
"Heh heh heh, so long, suckers!" he calls, driving down a seldom-used
road.  He stops in front of a big rock, pushes a Stonecutter garage door
opener, and the rock splits in two, revealing a covered tunnel that
leads straight to work.  Its walls are lined with paintings; Handel's
"Water Music" plays over speakers.

Homer parks at the plant next to the fence again.  Bart walks up on the
other side and asks, "Same old space, huh, Dad?"  Homer affirms, "Yes,
but they gave me these rollerblades so I can glide to the front door."
"Gliding" proves to be more like balancing with difficulty, but Homer
laughs and says, "Sweet!" nonetheless.

At Homer's work station, a workman brings in a new, nice chair for him.
Carl and Lenny watch.

Homer: Jealous?
Lenny: Well...no, we've got the same chair.
Homer: [smug] You're jealous.
Lenny: Your membership pack.  [hands it to him]
Homer: [pulls out a decal] What's this?
Lenny: You put that sticker on your car so you won't get any tickets.
       And this other one keeps paramedics from stealing your wallet
       while they're working on you.
 Carl: Oh, and don't bother calling 911 any more...here's the _real_
       number.  [hands him a card with "912"]
Homer: Ooh!
-- 912 ain't no joke, 

{Homer reads to Lisa from the "Secret World History".}

      Lisa: {I _still_ don't believe all the founding fathers were
            Stonecutters.}
     Homer: {That's because you trust your stupid schoolbooks.  Here's
            what _really_ happened at the signing of the Declaration of
            Independence.
             [flash to signing]}
Washington: {And a nation is born.  Now let us party like 'twas 1799!
             [small kegs are rolled in; two men chug]}
  Everyone: {[chanting] Quaff!  Quaff!  Quaff!  Quaff!
             [a man lights a match, blows beer at it]
             [it makes a flamethrower and burns another man's wig]}
     Owner: {Please, sir!  You're destroying my establishment.}
       Man: {We just created the greatest democracy on earth, you low-
            life commoner.  [kicks him]}
     Homer: {[in the present] You want to see how Davy Crockett _really_
            died at the Alamo?  You must be eighteen...}
-- Or is that NC-17?, 

Marge walks in with a phone message for Homer, who drinks a beer on the
couch.

Marge: Homer, a man who called himself You-Know-Who just invited you to
       a secret wink-wink at the you-know-what.  You certainly are
       popular now that you're a Stonecutter.
Homer: Oh, yeah.  [reads from a book] "Beer busts, beer blasts, keggers,
       stein hoists, A.A. meetings, beer nights..." It's wonderful,
       Marge!  I've never felt so accepted in all my life.  These people
       look deep within my soul and assign me a number based on the
       order in which I joined.  [sniffs tearily]
-- A true measure of worth, 

At the next meeting, everyone raises their glasses and sings.

Everyone: Who controls the British crown?
          Who keeps the metric system down?
          We do!  We do.
          Who leaves the Atlantis off the maps?  [shot of Carl]
          Who keeps the Martians under wraps?  [shot of Lenny]
          We do!  We do.  [shot of Martian]
          Who holds back the electric car?
          Who makes Steve Guttenberg a star?  [shot of Steve]
          We do!  We do.
          Who robs cave fish of their sight?  [shot of Skinner]
          Who rigs every Oscar night?  [shot of Homer]
          We do!  We do.
-- The Stonecutters' call to order, 

Number One thanks everyone for the rousing chorus.

Number One: Tonight we are here to commemorate our glorious society's
            1500th anniversary, and in honor of this momentous
            occasion...we're havin' ribs.
             [everyone cheers as caterers roll carts out]
     Homer: Uh oh, I need a bib.  If I slop any on my shirt, I could
            lose the respect of my beloved bretheren.
Number One: So let us rejoice and enjoy our meal in the shadow of the
            hallowed, sacred parchment.
             [everyone looks, gasps to see it gone]
     Lenny: Homer...[points at his "bib" -- the parchment]
     Homer: Huh?  Oh, yeah.  Thanks, Lenny.  [wipes his mouth with it]
Number One: This is just appalling and outrageous!
     Homer: What, did I miss something?  [wipes his mouth again]
             [everyone murmurs angrily]
    Krusty: Oh...
       Moe: Oh, God!
     Lenny: Oh, Homer, no!  [Homer cleans his ears] This is outrageous:
            you can't do that!  [Homer blows his nose] No!
      Carl: You really are stupid.
-- Hallowed, sacred, slightly soiled parchment, 

The sacred parchment, now torn and smeared, is hung again on the wall.
Homer is forced to leave the Stonecutters.

            [Homer hands over his robe]
Number One: And the official Stonecutter underwear too.
     Homer: Aw.  [hands it over]
             [Number One places them on a fire; ghosts fly out of them
            as they burn up]
     Homer: Please don't kick me out.  This society is everything to me.
            Please give me another chance.  I've learned my lesson!
            I've!  Learned!  My!  Les!  Son!  [pounds parchment five
            times in his misery]
             [everyone clamors for more punishment]
            Oh, sorry.
-- Homer "learns" another lesson, 

Number One: Homer Simpson, for your continuing and baffling desecration
            of our beloved sacred parchment, you are hereby banished
            from the stonecutters forever.  And as a final humiliation,
            you must walk home naked, dragging behind you the Stone of
            Shame.
             [someone snaps a metal collar around his neck]
             [he starts to walk out when everyone gasps and points]
   Hibbert: The mark!
     Homer: Oh, that.  It's just a birthmark.  And I'll thank you not to
            stare!
       Moe: He's the Chosen One!
             [everyone bows low before him]
Number One: You are the Chosen One whom the sacred parchment prophesied
            would lead us to glory!  Now to the top of Mount Springfield
            for the coronation!  Remove the Shone of Shame.
     Homer: Woo hoo!
Number One: Attach the Stone of Triumph!
     Homer: B'oh!
  Everyone: Yay!  [they all run off]
             [Homer strains like anything with the new larger stone]
-- Rags to riches, 

[End of Act Two.  Time: 14:50]

Homer, newly dressed in a special outfit, runs out onto a stage and
marvels as the rest of the Stonecutters bow down.  "Wow.  Mental note:
don't overdo this," he says.  He walks off and everyone stands, but he
then hops back out and everyone bows again.  And, in true Homer fashion,
keeps running out and running in while everyone is forced to keep
standing then bowing again.

At home, an artist finishes painting a portrait of the Chosen One atop
Mount Springfield with a heavenly light shining on him while the other
Stonecutters stare with wonder.  The real Homer sits on the couch,
dazed, his robes open, a beer in one hand.

Homer: I've always wondered if there was a god.  And now I know there is
       -- and it's me.
Marge: You're not a god, Homer.
 Lisa: Remember Dad, "All glory is fleeting."
Homer: So?
 Lisa: "Beware the Ides of March."
Homer: No!
 Lisa: Dad, I know you think you're happy now, but it's not going to
       last forever.
Homer: Everything lasts forever.
 Lisa: Don't you see?  Getting what you want all the time will
       ultimately leave you unfulfilled and joyless.
Homer: Remove the girl...
 Lisa: Dad, you're not with your Stonecutters now.  There are no lackeys
       around to carry out your every --
        [Bart covers her mouth, drags her away, then salutes]
-- Bart, Homer's lackey?, 

At the bowling alley, Homer bowls with the Chosen One ball.  He hits the
pins well, but one pin wobbles then decides to stay up.  Chief Wiggum
unholsters his gun and shoots it down.  "Another strike for the chosen
one!  Hurrah!" calls the assembled group of Stonecutters.  "Woo hoo!"
cheers Homer.

At the pool table, Homer breaks, and all the balls follow roundabout
paths to the right corner pocket.  "Well that's just an excellent
break," comments Moe, and the others agree.  The camera pulls back to
reveal a man tilting the table strongly.

At the poker table, Carl shows a pair of tens, Wiggum a pair of kings,
Lenny three twos, and Moe two aces.

   Homer: Uh...I'm out.
    Carl: No, no no, Homer, you have the Royal, um...Sampler.  [three
          six ten jack king]
   Homer: [bored] Oh, I win again, don't I. Woo hoo.
           [everyone congratulates him]
          You know, I think you guys are letting me win.
Everyone: No!  No...
   Homer: From now on you want me to be honest with me.  I mean, I'm not
          perfect, right?
    Carl: Uh...y -- uh, yeah.
  Wiggum: Um, well, y -- na -- y -- na -- um --
     Moe: Um, y -- uh -- y -- n -- run!
           [everyone takes off]
-- A hard time with the truth, 

In Lisa's class at school, Skinner walks in.

 Skinner: [to Lisa] The Grand Exulted Leader requests a moment of your
          time.  [claps hands] Class dismissed!
Children: Yay!
  Hoover: Yay.
   Homer: [walks in] Lisa, you were right.  My happiness _is_ fading.
    Lisa: You're experiencing spiritual emptiness because your power has
          isolated you from other human beings.
   Homer: What do you mean, isolated?
           [echo in the class: "ated...ated...ated...ated"]
    Lisa: Well, maybe you could reach out to the community and help
          other people.
   Homer: Hmm...I _could_ help others.  [slowly] I'll get a bunch of
          monkeys, dress them up, and make them reenact the civil war.
    Lisa: Dad, that doesn't help people!
   Homer: Couldn't hurt...unless the monkeys start hurting people.
          Which they almost certainly would.
-- It was the best of times..., 

At the next Stonecutter meeting, Homer bangs his gavel as the crowd
toast each other with beer steins.  They turn to face him and cheer.

Homer: Brothers, I've learned a wonderful lesson: helping others makes
       our own lives better and makes us better people.  So instead of
       just shooting pool and drinking beer, let us Stonecutters use
       what we have to help the less fortunate.
        [crowd stares, dumbfounded; crickets chirp]
  Moe: He's gone mad with power like that Albert Schweitzer guy.
-- Albert, Adolf, what's the difference, 

So Homer starts a "Stonecutters Daycare Center" in front of the
Stonecutter temple.  Homer seesaws with a bunch of kids at once; Barney
is covered with children as he walks; Lenny and Carl play jumprope with
a child.  At the top of a twirly tube slide, Moe calls "Whee!" and
slides down with a child in his lap.  Only the child makes it to the
bottom, though, as Moe calls out, "Ooh, for the love of God!  Somebody
get the jaws of life."

Herman throws a ball at a child with his arm, and Monty Burns tries to
push a child in a swing.  "Higher!" screams the hardly-moving child,
"Higher!"  Monty intones, "Oh, I'll give you higher, my filthy little
urchin," and pushes hard.  He forgets to move out of the way, though,
and gets smucked in the face first, then the back of the head.  "You've
won this round," he concedes, only to get smacked by the child again.

Homer assembles the crew to repaint an apartment building covered with
graffiti.  The superintendent walks out and kisses Homer.  "It looks so
much better...a beautiful sky blue," she admires as a helicopter crashes
into it.

At home, the pets watch Homer with respect as he talks to his family.

     Homer: You were right, Lisa: I've never felt so spiritually
            fulfilled.  And with my brothers the Stonecutters behind me,
            this is the beginning of a better world for all of us.
       Moe: We've got to kill him!
Number One: Take it easy, Moe.  Let's hear from the Stonecutter world
            council before we act too rashly.
   Orville: Kill him.
 Nicholson: Kill him.
     Mr. T: Kill the fool!
      Bush: I'm afraid I have to disagree with Orville, Jack, and Mr.
            Can't we just do something to his voice box?
-- Sage World Council advice, 

Number One: We might as well face the truth: as long as we're
            Stonecutters, he will control our lives.
       Moe: Maybe...but _maybe_ we don't want to be Stonecutters no
            more.
             [a crane removes a "Baskin Robbins" sign and replaces it
            with "Abandoned Store"]
Number One: Silence!  I now call to order the first meeting of the
            ancient mystic society of...No Homers.
             [George Bush unveils a logo]
  Everyone: Yay!
     Homer: [knocking] Hey fellahs, can I join?
Number One: Sorry...no Homers.
  Homer G.: Hyuck hyuck.
-- No Homers, plural, already!, 

So Homer calls a meeting at the old Stonecutter meeting hall.

    Homer: Loyal Stonecutters, let us begin our reenactment of the
           Battle of Gettysburg.
            [camera pulls back to reveal scattered, costumed monkeys]
    Marge: [walking in] Homer, you can't just keep hanging out with
           these globus monkeys.  Somebody's going to get parasites.
    Homer: Oh Marge, kids, I miss my club.
    Marge: Oh, Homey.  You know, you _are_ a member of a very exclusive
           club.
    Homer: Black panthers?
    Marge: No, the family Simpson, which has just five members -- and
           only two of those members have special rings.
Bart+Lisa: Yeah!
            [they blow on their whistle rings]
    Marge: I meant our wedding rings!
-- 

Homer: You know, Marge, you're right.  The Simpson family is the best
       possible club I could belong to.
        [group hug]
        [at home, Bart paddles Homer]
Homer: This club better be worth it!
        [Bart paddles Homer more]
Marge: All right, all right.  It's Lisa's turn.
-- Democracy in the Simpson family club, 

[End of Act Thre.  Time: 21:04]

Over the credits, the Stonecutter theme song plays.  When the Gracie
logo appears and the woman says "Shh!", Carl's voice says, "Shut up!"
 EPISODE TITLE: And Maggie Makes Three


EPISODE SUMMARY: 
[Syndication cuts are marked in curly braces "{}" and are courtesy of
Ricardo Lafaurie and Frederic Briere.]

The scene opens on a TV show.  A speedboat drives into view.

 Announcer: We now return to "Knightboat: the Crime-Solving Boat".
   Michael: Faster, Knightboat!  We gotta catch those starfish poachers.
Knightboat: You don't have to yell, Michael, I'm all around you.
   Michael: Oh, no!  They're headed for land.
             [the poachers ride onto the beach, jump on motorcycles, and
            speed away]
   Michael: We'll never catch them now.
Knightboat: Incorrect: look!  A canal.
     Homer: Go, Knightboat, go!
      Bart: Oh, every week there's a canal.
      Lisa: Or an inlet.
      Bart: Or a fjord.
     Homer: Quiet!  I will not hear another word against the boat.
-- Ripoff 90s shows, 

Marge walks in.

Marge: OK, TV off.  It's family time.
Homer: Oh, but Marge!  Knightboat, the _crime-solving_ boat.
Marge: Homer, you promised.  One night of family time a week -- besides,
       that backtalking boat sets a bad example.
 Bart: Says you, woman.
-- Marge, right yet again, 

Marge turns the TV off amidst groans.

Marge: All right, family time begins now.
        [turns a kitchen timer to 0:60]
        [Bart yawns; Homer yawns]
        [Homer grabs the timer and starts turning it the other way]
Marge: Homer!
Homer: It was Bart.
-- Homer and his scapegoats, 

     Lisa: Why don't we all look at the photo album?
    Homer: [as Marge opens it] So many memories.  Aw, look --
           Knightboat.
Bart+Lisa: Aww...
    Homer: And _here's_ our TV next to the mirror!  It looks like we
           have two.
Bart+Lisa: Wow, two!
    Marge: Yeah, yeah, yeah, two.  Let's get to the baby pictures.
Bart+Lisa: Aw, Mom!
    Homer: [sarcastic] Oh, yeah, _that's_ exciting.
-- Quality family time, 

Marge shows one of a young Bart, naked, with a cowboy at, riding
Snowball I. The next is of young Lisa next to a giant castle of blocks
she's built.  In the next, a Lisa cries as Bart stands among the ruins
of her castle.

           [looking at the photo album]
    Marge: Here's Bart sleeping.  Here he is dozing...here he is after a
           visit from the sandman.  Ooh, here's nappy time, Bart!
           Here's a cute one: he's all tuckered out.
     Lisa: Why aren't there any pictures of Maggie?
            [Maggie looks worried]
    Homer: Well I'm _glad_ you asked.  It's actually a very interesting
           story.
Bart+Lisa: [groaning] Oh...
    Homer: It all began about two years ago before Maggie was even born.
           {Bart, you were Lisa's age and Lisa, you were...the age Bart
           was several years ago.}
     Bart: {Get the camera ready, Bart very sleepy...[yawns]}
-- Photo ops, 

    Homer: {Listen carefully and my words will shape images as clear as
           any TV show.}  It was a tumultuous time for our nation: the
           clear beverage craze gave us all a reason to live.  The
           information superhighway showed the average person what some
           nerd thinks about Star Trek.  And the domestication of the
           dog continued unabated.
            [flash to Homer at work]
           I was at my work station when suddenly --
            [a voice comes over the PA]
Terrorist: Attention American workers: your plant has been taken over by
           an all-star team of freelance terrorists.
            [the lights go off; the emergency lighting comes on]
    Homer: Not on _my_ shift!  [jumps into an overhead vent]
            [in Burns' office, terrorists prepare to kill bound and
           gagged Lenny, Burns, and Carl]
            [Homer arrives through a vent and karate chops them all]
    Homer: Simpson ten, terrorists eight.
            [the gagged captives laugh despite themselves]
    Marge: Homer, tell the story right!
    Homer: Oh, OK.
-- Hyperbolic Homer, 

In the actual story...

          [Homer raises his arms one at a time in front of a fan]
           [Carl and Lenny hold hankies to their noses and cough]
    Carl: [gagging] Homer, you should see a doctor -- I don't think a
          healthy man can make that kind of smell.
Smithers: [walking in] Your paychecks, gentlemen.
   Homer: [opening his] Woo hoo!  This is it: with this single, glorious
          check, I'm finally completely out of debt!  [he checks a
          calendar with the 18th circled: "Out of debt here"]
          Yes!  With my bills paid off, I can finally quit this lousy
          job.
   Lenny: But Homer, how are you going to make a living?
   Homer: Don't worry about Homer J., I've got a plan.  [menacing] A
          plan that'll fix you good...
    Carl: Hey, what did we do?
   Homer: Sorry, that just slipped out.  [hugs them] I'll miss you.
-- Homer's sincere departure, 

Homer walks into Burns' office.

Homer: Did you hear me?  I said I quit, Monty!  And since I quit, I can
       do anything I want.
Burns: Is that so?
Homer: Ooh, lovely desk.  It would be too bad if someone, oh, I don't
       know...didn't use a coaster!
        [picks glass off coaster, puts it on the desk]
Burns: [gasps]
Homer: [laughs] Such a nice tidy office...maybe it's time you started
       living like a pig!
        [empties single wad of paper from garbage pail onto floor]
Burns: [stammers incoherently]
Homer: Oh, I hope I haven't upset you...bongo-head!
        [starts playing the bongos on Burns' head, grunting along]
Burns: [calm] Oh, I should be resisting this, but I'm paralyzed with
       rage...and island rhythms.
        [Homer drives through the plant on an electric car]
        [everyone cheers as Homer continues playing]
 Carl: Yeah, way to play the boss' head like a bongo, Homer!
Lenny: [moving to the beat] He's getting a pretty good sound out of that
       guy.
-- New uses for Burns' pate, 

Outside the plant, Homer tosses Burns off the cart with a "That's for
employing me for eight years!"  On his way across a wooden bridge, he
tosses a match on it, setting it alight.

 Homer: And that is that!  Goodbye mind-numbing, back-breaking labor
        forever.  Hello, dream job in paradise.
         [scene switch to Homer against a backdrop of blue skies,
        beaches, palm trees, and steel drum music]
        And now, the final phase of my plan.
         [camera pulls back to reveal Homer is at the bowling alley]
         [walking up to him] Hey Barney, any chance you can get me a job
        here?
Barney: Hey, sure, Homer.  I told you, my uncle owns the place.  Hey,
        Uncle Al: can Homer here have a job?
    Al: Sure.
 Homer: Woo hoo!  [dances a little jig]
    Al: Barney, you're fired.
Barney: OK.  [walks away]
    Al: Show up tomorrow.  Bring three rags.  Oh!  And, uh, change your
        pants.
 Homer: Why?
    Al: When it happens, you'll know.
-- Homer's new plan for life, 

At home...

     Bart: You're a pin-monkey?  Wow!  Finally I don't have to be
           ashamed of my father's job.
     Lisa: I think it's romantic, throwing off the shackles of the
           workaday world and following a dream...of sorts.
    Marge: I don't know if it's such a good idea.  Can we get by on a
           pin-monkey's salary?
    Homer: Don't worry, Marge, I've come up with a perfectly balanced
           budget.  There will be exactly enough money for you, me,
           Bart, and Lisa, if we make a few small sacrifices.
    Marge: [skeptical] Uh huh...
    Homer: From now on, we use regular toilet paper, not that fancy
           quilted kind.
            [Bart punches the wall]
    Homer: And only one of you kids can go to college.
Bart+Lisa: Fine.
-- Probably _not_ Bart, I'm guessing, 

Homer continues his narration.

       [scene shows Marge dressing up and Homer in a suit]
Homer: [voice-over] That night, your mother and I went out for a
       romantic evening to celebrate the start of our new life...
        ["At the Copacabana" plays]
        [camera shows Marge and Homer dancing while seated in the car at
       at Krusty Burger drive thru]
Homer: [voice-over] ...followed by a stroll on the beach.
        [they lie down on the sand near the water and kiss]
Homer: Marge...
Marge: Homer...
Homer: [sly] I've got sand in my underpants.
Marge: Me too.  Let's go home.
        [they leave; Homer runs back quickly to scoop more sand into his
       pants]
-- So much for _that_ lumbering double entendre, "And Maggie Makes
    Three"

At home, Homer enters the bedroom with Marge in his arms and manages to
remove his shoes, jacket, and tie without putting her down.

Homer: [sighs] I love you, Marge.
Marge: I love you too, Homey.
Homer: Everything in our lives is finally perfectly balanced.  I hope
       things stay exactly like this forever.
Marge: Mm hmm.
        ["Seconds later" scene shows lots of little Homer sperm bumping
       their heads and going "D'oh!  D'oh!"]
        [one breaks through the egg and goes "Woo hoo!"]
        [scene switch to present day, Homer swimming like a sperm]
Marge: Did you have to be so graphic?
Homer: It's OK, Marge: they pave the way for this kind of filth in
       school.
-- Homer gives sex-ed lessons, 

     Lisa: So, Dad, were you excited that Mom was pregnant?
    Homer: Actually, your mother hadn't told me.  At that time I had no
           idea Maggie even existed.
            [he goes to sit down, right where Maggie is]
Bart+Lisa: Dad!  [Marge grabs her away]
    Homer: [not realizing] Hi Maggie!
-- At _that_ time?, 

[End of Act One.  Time: 7:51]

Homer continues the story.

Homer: So anywho, back then there was _no_ way for me to know your
       mother was pregnant.
        [flash to Marge pushing Homer out of the way, running into the
       bathroom, and throwing up]
Homer: Marge, you tie up the bathroom every morning!  I've got to wash
       my hair.  [pounds on door]
-- 

Homer: [voice-over] The next few weeks at my dream job were like a
       wonderful waking coma.
        [Homer turns the balls so all finger holes point the same way]
        [everyone walking by says, "Hi Homer!" cheerfully]
Homer: [spraying shoes then sniffing them] Mmm, bowling fresh.
        [putting urinal cakes in the urinals] Mmm, urinal fresh.
        [Homer shines a ball in the "Shine-O Ball-O; glances around
       furtively, then shines his head in it]
   Al: [reflected in Homer's head] Homer, did you polish your head in
       the Shine-O Ball-O?
Homer: Mmm...no.
   Al: OK, then.  [checks his hair, then walks off]
-- I guess Homer's got an oily T-zone, 

Homer explains, "I slowly learned the intricate mysteries of the alley,
like where the pins go after they're knocked down."  Jacques bowls a
strike, and pins fall down a chute onto a huge pile.  A truck, meanwhile
feeds logs onto a conveyer belt which are each whittled down to a single
pin, painted white, varnished, hardened, painted with two red stripes by
hand, then checked by a man in a lab coat.

          [Homer serves drinks to bowlers]
   Homer: [voice-over] I was in heaven.  If horseracing is the sport of
          kings, then surely bowling is a...very good sport as well.
Bowler 1: Hey, great job, Homer.
Bowler 2: Thanks a lot, Homer.
Bowler 3: Hey, you're the best.
   Homer: [singing] I'm going to make it after all!
           [tosses his bowling ball, which breaks through the alley]
-- Homer Tyler Moore, 

Meanwhile, Dr. Hibbert, sporting an Arsenioesque shaved brush cut, has
some news for Marge.

Hibbert: Congratulations, Mrs. Simpson: you're pregnant.
  Marge: Mmm...
Hibbert: Am I to take it that this is [chuckles] an unwanted pregnancy?
  Marge: Oh, no, no, not exactly.  It's just that I haven't told Homer
         yet, and with his new job, I don't know how we're going to be
         able to afford this.
Hibbert: Well, you know a healthy baby can bring upwards of $60,000.
  Marge: What?!
Hibbert: Well, of course, that was just a test.  Er, had you reacted
         differently, you'd be in jail right now.  Simply a test.
         [laughs uncomfortably]
-- Dr. Hibbert, evil Republican, 

Marge breaks the news to her children.

Marge: So in a few months, both of you will have a brand new brother or
       sister.
 Bart: Been there, done that.
 Lisa: I hope it's a girl.
 Bart: You know nothing about genetics, Lis: it goes boy, girl, boy,
       girl.
 Lisa: You're worried about telling Dad, aren't you, Mom?
Marge: Why do you say that?
 Lisa: Well you've been in my room for about four hours now.
Marge: Hey, I'm just hangin'.
        [Marge goes to the door and peeks around the corner furtively]
-- A bun in the oven, 

That night, before bed, Marge decides to tell Homer.

Marge: Homey, I --
Homer: Can't talk, praying.  Dear Lord, the gods have been good to me
       and I am thankful.  For the first time in my life, everything is
       absolutely perfect just the way it is.
Marge: Mmm.
Homer: So here's the deal: you freeze everything as it is, and I won't
       ask for anything more.  If that is OK, please give me absolutely
       no sign.  [brief pause] OK, deal.
       In gratitude, I present you this offering of cookies and milk.
       If you want me to eat them for you, please give me no sign.
       [brief pause] Thy will be done!  [mows down]
-- Homer's solution to the Lord's unresponsiveness, "And Maggie Makes
    Three"

Marge's sisters make googling noises at Marge's large stomach, their
cigarettes making Marge (and her baby) cough.

      Marge: I've got to tell Homer about this baby in just the right
             way and at just the right time.  Until then, please, keep
             this to yourselves.
      Patty: Oh, if he found out now, it would probably destroy him,
             huh?
      Marge: Oh, yes.
Patty+Selma: Gotta go!
      Marge: Wait a minute!  Wait, I know that look.  Now promise you
             won't tell Homer.
      Selma: Oh, we promise we won't tell..._Homer_.
              [they go to the phone book and open it to page one]
      Patty: [dials 356756] Hello, is this A. Aaronson?  It might
             interest to you to know that Marge Simpson is pregnant
             again.
              [later]
      Patty: [on the phone] Just thought you'd like to know, Mr.
             Zykowski.  [hangs up, sighs] There.  Aaronson and Zykowski
             are the two biggest gossips in town.  In an hour, everyone
             will know.
-- Odd last-name coincidences, 

Homer walks out of the bowling alley, refreshed.

 Homer: Ah, another perfect day in my perfect life with my perfect job.
Wiggum: [driving by] Hey, just heard the news over the squawk box.
        That's nice work, Homer.
 Homer: Thank you, thank you very much.  It is nice work.
   Apu: Oh, Mr. Simpson, I have just heard about the little bundle of
        joy.  Congratulations, sir!
 Homer: It's true, the bundle is little, but I'm not in it for the
        money.
   Moe: [sly] Hey, Homer!  Way to get Marge pregnant.  [laughs]
 Homer: This is getting very abstract, but thank you: I _do_ enjoy
        working at the bowling alley.
-- Nietzschean Moe, 

Marge enters the front door of her house.

   Everyone: Surprise!  Baby shower.
      Marge: Baby shower?  You _know_ I haven't told Homer yet, and
             he'll be home any minute.
Patty+Selma: [mocking] Oh _really_?
              [the door opens]
      Marge: [gasps, sees no one there] Phew!  [starts to close the
             door]
      Homer: [barging in] Hey, it's me.  It's hell out there!
              [notices everyone standing around]
             Hey, wait a minute.  What are all these presents?  It looks
             like you're..._showering_ Marge with gifts.  Hmm...with
             little, tiny baby-sized gifts.  Well, I'll be in the tub.
             [walks up stairs]
      Maude: By the way, congratulations on your new job, Homer.
      Homer: New job?  ...Marge is pregnant?!  [pulls hair out] Noooooo!
             [runs up stairs screaming, slams bedroom door]
-- Homer infers an exceedingly indirect inference, "And Maggie Makes
    Three"

 Bart: [in the present] Wow, Dad, you really threw a tantrum like a
       little sissy girl?
Homer: Oh, just that one time.
Marge: Actually, when I was about to have Bart --
Homer: [in flashback] You're pregnant?!  [pulls hair, screams]
Marge: [in the present] And then when I told him about Lisa --
Homer: [in flashback] You're pregnant again?!  [pulls hair, screams,
       runs off]
Homer: [in the present] Well, who _wouldn't_ be upset?  That new baby in
       your mother's womb was a ticking time bomb threatening to blow
       this family eight ways from Sunday.
        [Bart and Lisa are walking off]
       Hey!  Where are you going?
 Bart: Dad, you can't expect a person to sit for thirty minutes
       straight.
 Lisa: I'm going to get a snack, or maybe go to the bathroom.
Marge: I'll stay here, but I'm going to think about products I might
       like to purchase.  [closes eyes] Ooh...mmm...ooh, I don't have
       that.
-- Leading to commercial, 

[End of Act Two.  Time: 14:23]

Homer whines to Marge that night.

Homer: Oh, you're pregnant!  We're going to have to have a baby.  All
       our financial plans are ruined.  We're doomed...doomed, I tells
       ya!
        [Homer's head expands, then explodes]
Marge: [in the present] Bart, let your father tell the story.
Homer: Yeah!
 Bart: OK, but I know funny.
Homer: Anywho...
Homer: [in the past, still headless] [weeps] We're doomed!
Marge: [voice-over] Homer, you had a head.
Homer: [voice-over] Check.
        [a new one grows]
Marge: And your bottom was a little bigger.
Homer: Aw.
        [it inflates like a balloon]
-- Poetic license, 

Marge: You've worked hard at the bowling alley.  Why don't you ask for a
       raise?
Homer: Yeah, a raise.  I've never been good enough at any job to deserve
       one before, but I'm damn good at this one.  That's it: I'm going
       to march right up to Al and say --
        [at the alley]
Homer: Steve!  I mean, Al!  I think I deserve a raise.
   Al: Aw, you're a hard worker, and I'd like to give you a raise, but
       the alley just ain't doing enough business to pay that kind of
       money.
Homer: How about...if I _triple_ the business?  Then could I get a
       raise?
   Al: Well, yeah, but --
Homer: [motions him to stop]
        [shot of Homer reading "Advanced Marketing" at home]
        [shot of garbage can containing "Advanced Marketing" and Homer
       reading "Basic Marketing"]
        [shot of both books in garbage and Homer reading the dictionary]
-- Slow starts, 

Homer stares at a bowling ball for a while after looking up "marketing",
then leaps forward: "Of course!"  He stands in front of the bowling
alley firing a shotgun repeatedly into the air and entreating the
screaming people around him to come and bowl.

 Lisa: Mom, make Dad tell the story right!
Marge: That's what really happened.
 Lisa: Oh...
-- Homer describes his marketing plan involving a shotgun, "And Maggie
    Makes Three"

          [Homer walks dejected through the empty alley]
   Homer: [voice-over] My marketing plan attracted a record number of
          police and fire officials.  But few stayed to bowl.  I'd
          failed.  Quitting my dream job was the hardest thing I'd ever
          done.
      Al: You did a great job, Homer, and I'm really going to miss you.
          The place has never been cleaner, and the way you kept the
          young people away -- whew!  That was beautiful.
           [assembled bowlers murmur assent]
          Anyway, we all pitched in and we got you this little going-
          away thing.
           [a jacket saying "Sorry you had to 'split'"]
   Homer: [sniffs] This was the happiest time of my life.  I'll never
          forget you guys.  Especially you, Joey.
    Joey: [a young boy dressed like a shoe-shine boy] See you 'round,
          Mr. Homer.
   Homer: Don't worry, Joey, we'll make it to California some day.
    Joey: Sure we will, Mr. Homer, sure we will.  [coughs]
Bowler 1: It's going to be sad around here without you, Homer.
           [bowlers murmur assent as Homer walks out]
Bowler 2: Boy, this is depressing.
Bowler 3: Hey, I know what would cheer us up: bowling!
-- Homer's grandiose plans laid to rest, 

Homer listens to the sounds of the bowling alley one last time, then
walks away.  "I needed more money to support my growing family," Homer
continues, "and there was only one place in town that a man like me
could make it.  The camera pans to the power plant; Homer begins walking
slowly towards it.  As he arrives, it begins raining, and the guard at
the gate says, "Uh oh, acid rain again," [HS] as he puts on a gas mask.
The rain dissolves Homer's going-away present.

Homer approaches a woman sitting at a desk in front of a giant portrait
of Mr. Snrub -- I mean, Mr. Burns.

Woman: Yes?  Are you a new applicant?
Homer: Actually, I quit and I came to get my job back.
Woman: Through there.  [points to a doggy door]
        [Homer crawls through, into Mr. Burns' office]
        [he coughs up dust]
Burns: So...come crawling back, eh?
Homer: Seems like the classy thing to do would be not to call attention
       to it.
-- Trying to convince Monty of reason, 

Smithers and Burns lead Homer to his work station.

   Homer: Thanks for giving me my old job back.
   Burns: I'm afraid it's not that simple.  As punishment for your
          desertion, it's company policy to give you the plague.
Smithers: Uh, sir, that's the plaque.
   Burns: Ah yes, the special demotivational plaque to break what's left
          of your spirit.  Because, you see, you're here forever.
           [Smithers screws a "Don't forget: you're here forever" plaque
          into the wall]
   Burns: Don't forget: you're here forever!
-- Unpleasant reminders, 

Homer arrives home dejected.

Homer: Aw, I've never been so miserable in all my life.  But I can't
       take it out on Marge and the kids -- I've gotta carry the burden
       all by myself.
        [walks in] Hi, honey, how are you?
Marge: Well, actually --
Homer: Aw, I can't go on with this charade any longer!  I hate my job, I
       hate my life, and ever since I found out about this baby there's
       been nothing but bad luck.
Marge: My contractions started an hour ago.
Homer: It's just in one ear and out the other with you, isn't it, Marge?
-- Homer, sensitive new-age man, 

At the hospital, {Mayor Quimby holds a newborn child in his arms while
the mother (a young woman) rests.}

    Quimby: {This is incredible.  It's God's most wondrous miracle.}
     Nurse: {Sir, I think your wife wants to hold the baby.}
    Quimby: {My wife?  Where?  Where?!  [runs off in a panic]}
    Doctor: {Congratulations, it's a boy!  [takes a polaroid]}
McAllister: {Argh.  [holding his baby by the feet] You're truly the
            catch of the day.}
     Homer: [nonplussed] It's wonderful, it's magical, oh boy, here it
            comes, another mouth.
   Hibbert: One more push should do it.
     Homer: Marvelous.
             [a baby cries once, then again]
   Hibbert: Congratulations, Mr. Simpson: you have a beautiful, healthy
            baby.
     Homer: OK.  [makes thumbs up sign]
             [Maggie grabs the thumb with her tiny hand] Huh?
     Marge: Homey, I think someone is saying "Hello".
     Homer: Hello.  Aw, it's a boy -- and what a boy!
   Hibbert: Er, that's the umbilical cord.  It's a girl.
-- Details, 

Homer: A girl!  Oh, Marge, we have a wonderful baby girl.  Not just a
       girl -- the most beautiful baby girl in the whole world.
Marge: [sighs]
Homer: Come on, Marge, show a little enthusiasm.
        [they kiss; Maggie shapes her lips like a kiss, then grabs a
       pacifier and sucks it]
-- The genesis of the pacifier explained, 

       [in the present]
 Lisa: So you loved her right from the start!
Homer: [tickling Maggie and giggling] Absolutely.
 Bart: Then why no pictures?
Homer: Oh, there are pictures.  I keep them where I need the most
       cheering up.
        [shot of pictures covering demotivational plaque at work]
        [all that can be seen of the plaque is "Do it for her"]

 EPISODE TITLE: Bart's Comet


EPISODE SUMMARY: 
[Syndication cuts are marked in curly braces "{}" and are courtesy of
Frederic Briere.]

The scene opens on Springfield Elementary.  Principal Skinner, decked
out in a lab coat and safety glasses, stands under a "Science Fair"
banner.

 Skinner: And now, to top off our most propane-explosion-free science
          week ever, our grand finale: the launching of a weather
          balloon!
Children: Yay!
    Bart: Go, weather balloon!  Hurrah for science, woo!
 Skinner: [to himself] "Hurrah for science, woo"?  I can't say I approve
          of the "woo" but the "hurrah" was quite heartening.
-- Skinner, censurer, 

"Release the balloon," calls the beloved principal.  Groundskeeper Willy
complies, snipping its string.  Everyone cheers as the balloon rises
except for Bart, who pulls a string, smiling.  Two flaps on the balloon
unfold, one with Skinner's head and arms holding a "Hi, I'm Big Butt
Skinner" sign, the other with Skinner's legs.  The children all point
and laugh.  "Nooo!" cries Skinner, running after it.

    Bart: I don't think I really captured the eyes.
Milhouse: Bart, if you have a failing, it's that you're always demanding
          perfection -- _if_ you have a failing.
 Skinner: Whoever brings down that balloon doesn't have to learn
          fractions!
Children: Yay!  [start throwing rocks at it]
 Skinner: [hearing clanking noises] Uh, careful, children, that's my
          car...
-- Bart pulls a weather balloon prank, 

Nelson and Jimbo, hearing that it's Skinner's car, purposely throw big
rocks straight at it and laugh.

Skinner: [ominous] Destroy that balloon.
  Willy: Aye.  [cocks a shotgun, shoots into the sky]
          [two fighter planes fly overhead]
Pilot 1: Tango 14, we're being fired at.  I'm getting an exact ID on the
         bogey now.
          [screen shows a silhouette of Willy and "Identify"]
          [screen flashes "Iraqi fighter jet"]
Pilot 1: Iraqis again.  Launching sidewinder missile.
          [missile destroys the other plane]
         Missed him.  Launching second sidewinder missile.
          [missile destroys his own plane]
Pilot 1: [parachuting] This is what happens when you cut money out of
         the military and put it into health care!
Pilot 2: [parachuting] It's a good program!  Just give it a chance,
         that's all I ask.
          [their parachutes fail; they crash to the ground]
-- Pros and cons of deficit reduction schemes, 

Back at the school, Skinner rues his misfortune.

 Skinner: Oh, it won't come down for months.  Curse the man who invented
          helium!  Curse Pierre-Jules-Cesar Janssen.  Now to find out
          who did this...Bart!  Empty your pockets.
    Bart: Empty _my_ pockets, you say?  [does so] Well, certainly, but I
          fail to see how --
 Skinner: [picking something up] Hmm...blueprints of the dummy...
          notarized photos of you _making_ the dummy...and an alternate
          wording for the _banner_, "Buttzilla".
    Bart: Race you to Utah, Milhouse.
Milhouse: OK.
-- Exit Bart, 

Skinner grabs Bart.

Skinner: I'm going to punish you for this, Bart -- and it won't just be
         a simple caning this time.  Because you have impeded science,
         you must now _aid_ science.  Yes...starting tomorrow, you will
         assist me with my amateur astronomy, taking down measurements,
         carrying equipment, and so forth. 4:30 in the morning.
   Bart: There's a 4:30 in the morning now?
-- Bart's twelve-hour days, 

The next morning, Bart's radio turns on at precisely 4:00.

   DJ: Top of the hour, time for the morning news.  But of course, there
       _is_ no news yet.  Everyone's still asleep in their comfy, comfy
       beds.  Good night, everybody.
 Bart: [groans] Oh...
       {[walks to his parents' room]}
       {Mom, will you make me breakfast?}
Marge: {[mostly asleep] There's a stuffed pepper in the trash from last
       night.  Just rinse it good.}
       {[downstairs, the pets watch TV]}
  {TV: Come home, Lassie.  Here, boy!  Come on, girl.}
       {[the pets see Bart coming and quickly turn the TV off and
       pretend to sleep]}
-- The secret nocturnal lives of pets, 

Bart opens the garage and drives his bike off to school.  On his way, he
observes, "Still dark...better use the generator."  He engages it, but
the pressure on his tire is so great that he has to struggle to move
forward at all.

He meets Skinner in a field near the school.

Skinner: Ah, there's nothing more exciting than science.  You get all
         the fun of sitting still, being quiet, writing down numbers,
         paying attention...[chuckles] Science has it all.
   Bart: Is that the telescope we're going to be looking through?
Skinner: Yes, but you won't be looking through it: I forbid it, heh heh.
         But you don't _need_ a telescope to enjoy astronomy, Bart:
         there are all the constellations you've heard so much about.
         [pointing] There's Orion, the swan, the chariot race --
   Bart: Why don't they look anything like their names?
Skinner: Well, you do have to use your imagination.  Look: there's the
         three wise men.  [points to Curly, Larry, and Moe]
-- Wise at slapstick, maybe, 

   Bart: Who names these things [the constellations] anyway?
Skinner: Whoever discovers them.  I've been hoping I could find
         something that would be named after me.
   Bart: And you've never found anything?
Skinner: Once...but by the time I got to the phone, my discovery had
         already been reported by Principal Kahoutek...[a cloud covers
         the moon; scary music plays]
         I got back at him, though...him and that little _boy_ of his.
          [the music ends]
         Anyway, that's why I always keep a cellular phone next to me.
-- The former green beret and his tricks, 

Skinner: Now, this morning we're going to be mapping a small square of
         sky that's thought to be empty.  It's my hope that it's not.
   Bart: So what am I supposed to do exactly?
Skinner: Just write down my findings as I give them to you.  Six hours
         nineteen minutes right ascension, fourteen degrees twenty-two
         minutes declination: no sighting.
   Bart: [bored] Mm hmm.
Skinner: Six hours nineteen minutes right ascension, fourteen degrees
         twenty-three minutes declination: no sighting.
   Bart: Mm hmm.
          [later]
Skinner: Six hours nineteen minutes right ascension, fourteen degrees
         fifty-eight minutes declination: no sighting.  Did you get that
         one Bart?
   Bart: Hell no?
Skinner: Good.
-- Gripping astronomy, 

Skinner spots something and gasps with excitement.

Skinner: My stars!  Give me the phone.  [dials 325-6753]
  Woman: [at observatory] Check out 6-19-14-59.
          [man at telescope does so]
          [the Skinner weather balloon comes into focus]
Skinner: No, there's no need to do that...it's already named after me.
-- Skinner the observator, 

Skinner: It's coming pretty close to the ground, maybe I can catch it.
         Don't touch the telescope, Bart.  A slight change in elevation
         can destroy a whole morning's work.  [runs off]
   Bart: [looks at telescope, grins, spins it] Woo!  Pirates off the
         port bow, all hands on deck!  [looks through it] Hey...
          [pushes "redial" on the phone]
         Hello, observatory?  This is Bart Simpson.  I see something in
         the sky at 4-12-8 and the last number is 7.
Skinner: [catching the balloon] Ah, got you, my rumpy doppelganger.
          [floats to ground next to Bart] I've got it!  I -- what are
         you doing?  Give me that phone!
  Woman: [on phone] Congratulations, Bart.  You've just discovered a
         comet.
Skinner: Nooo!
          [lets go of balloon by accident]
         Noooo!
          [paperman rides by, throws paper in front of him]
          [headline: "Prez Sez: school is for losers"]
         Nooooo!
-- A chapter of accidents, 

[End of Act One.  Time: 6:38]

At dinner that night, everyone chows down.

Homer: {And then I sped away without anyone seeing my license plate.}
 Lisa: {Sounds like you had a good day today, Dad.}
Homer: {Yeah...except I forgot to go to work.}
       {[everyone looks at him silently]}
Marge: What did you do today, Bart?
 Bart: What _didn't_ I do?  [hands his mother a newspaper]
Marge: [reads comet] "Boy Discovers Comet"...
 Lisa: What?
Marge: "A young Springfieldianite has discovered a new comet to be known
       as the `Bart Simpson Comet'."  [gasps] Oh, honey, I'm so _proud_
       of you.
 Bart: But then, you've _always_ been proud of me.
Marge: [pauses] Yes...
-- Well no, actually, 

The next day at lunch, Bart carries his tray past a table of children.

     Ham: Won't you join us, Bart?
    Bart: [looks around] Uh...I guess so.
Database: As the first student at Springfield Elementary to discover a
          comet, we're very proud to make you a member of our very
          select group.  Welcome to Super Friends.
    Bart: Huh?
    Kids: Welcome, Super Friend.
     Ham: I am called Ham, because I enjoy ham radio.  This is Email...
          Cosine...Report Card...Database...and Lisa.  Your nickname
          will be Cosmos.
    Bart: [finishing a mouthful hurriedly] Well, I'm done eating.
          Goodbye.
    Kids: Goodbye, Cosmos.
-- Bart's not as cool as Green Lantern, 

   Database: Perhaps some night you could show us your comet.
       Bart: [pointing] There it is right there.
   Database: I make it a point never to turn my head unless I expect to
             see something, Bart.  Now truly, we can't see your comet in
             broad daylight and without a telescope.
       Bart: But you don't _need_ a stupid telescope.  It's right
             _there_.
              [the kids look and gasp as they see it]
      Email: Oh no, no, no, this isn't right at all!
   Database: It must be coming toward us at a fantastic speed.
       Bart: Huh?
       Lisa: Don't you realize what's happening, Bart?  Your comet is
             going to collide with the Earth and every living thing in
             its path will be killed!
       Bart: I knew you'd try to find something wrong with my comet,
             Lisa.  You've always been petty and small, _right_ from the
             beginning.
Report Card: We must alert the proper authorities.
      Email: To the observatory!
-- The comet's threat is discovered, 

The Super Friends ride their bikes off to the observatory, singing "We
are the Super Friends."  Their newest member goes, "Shut up!"  One of
the astronomers focuses the telescope on the comet and intones "Dear
God!"  The other says, "Warren, we've talked about you hogging the
eyepiece."

   Abe: Sounds like the doomsday whistle!  Ain't been blown for nigh
        onto three years.
Jasper: Tsk, tsk, tsk...trouble abrewing.
-- The air raid siren blows, 

Diamond Joe Quimby calls a meeting at the town hall.

Quimby: Fellow citizens, when I learned about the impending crisis, I
        caught the very next plane to Springfeld...field.
         [everyone claps politely]
        First of all, yes, there is a comet in the sky, and yes, it is
        going to hit Springfield.
         [a couple of people clap]
        You don't need to applaud that.
-- The mayor calls a town meeting, 

Quimby: Now, here's what we think the impact might look like.  Show
        them, Jerry.
         [first slide shows arrows pointing to "Springfield" and the
        "Comet"]
         [second slide shows collision of two and an arrow pointing to
        "Moe's"]
   Moe: Oh, dear God, no!
         [third slide shows smoking crater with arrows pointing to
        "Charred Bodies"]
Quimby: Fortunately we have a plan: Professor Frink?
 Frink: Nn-hey, good evening, ladies and --
   Man: [hysterical] Quit stalling!  What's the plan?
 Frink: All right, just take your seat, just take your seat.
         [pulls a sheet off a model of the city]
        Now, working with former Carter Administration officials and
        military men who were forced into early retirement for various
        reasons which we won't go into here, nn-hey, we have planned
        this defense for the city: [flicks a switch] as the comet
        hurtles towards the city, our rocket will intercept it and blow
        it to smithereens.
         [little models of the comet and rocket demonstrate]
         [the comet explodes and catches "Moe's" on fire]
   Moe: Oh, dear God, no!
-- Moe, loser either way, 

"And that will be the end of Mr. Comet," forecasts Quimby.  Everyone
cheers and leaves the hall.  Once outside, they point at the comet and
laugh derisively -- all except Lisa, who looks around, worried.

Homer: Will you all stop worrying about that stupid comet?  It's going
       to be destroyed, didn't you hear what that guy in the building
       said?
 Lisa: But Dad, don't you think --
Homer: Uh, Lisa, the whole reason we have elected officials is so we
       don't _have_ to think all the time.  Just like that rainforest
       scare a few years back: our officials saw there was a problem and
       they fixed it, didn't they?
 Lisa: No, Dad, I don't think --
Homer: There's that word again.
-- Homer doing what he does best, 

A newspaper headline reads, "Rocket to Kick Comet's Tail".  The comet
looms large in the sky as everyone on the street looks up at it.  At the
Springfield Armory, the rocket (with a panel saying "Caution: aim way
from face" on the side) is raised on a platform and pointed towards the
sky.  The Simpson family sit on lawn chairs on their roof.

Marge: Homer, what if this doesn't work?
Homer: Well, then I have a backup plan.  See?  While the unprepared are
       still sitting around twiddling their thumbs and going --
       [twiddles his thumbs, hums a goofy tune]
 Bart: {[interrupts] Dad!  The plan.}
Homer: {I'm getting to that!  So anyway, they're going -- [twiddles his
       thumbs more, hums more]}
 Bart: [interrupts] Dad!
Homer: So anyway, we get in our car and take the bridge out of town, all
       the while they're still going -- [twiddles his thumbs and hums
       again]
 Lisa: [interrupts] Dad, they're firing the rocket!
Homer: [knocked backwards by the blast] All right!
-- The alternate plan cut short, 

The rocket climbs into the sky as everyone oohs and aahs.  Up, up it
flies, straight up to the comet...and passes right in front of it, down,
down onto the only bridge out of town, destroying it.

   Lisa: It blew up the bridge!  We're doomed.
  Homer: It's times like this I wish I were a religious man.
Lovejoy: [running down the street] It's all over, people!  We don't have
         a prayer, argh...
-- Religion, opiate of Homer, 

[End of Act Two.  Time: 12:40]

Kent Brockman delivers the news.

       Kent: And, like Icarus, the rocket foolishly soared too high, and
             lost control of its servo guidance mechanism, leaving us
             with some...[checks watch] six hours to live.  So, let's go
             live now to the charred remains of the only bridge out of
             town with Arnie Pie and Arnie in the Sky!
      Arnie: With the bridge gone and the airport unfortunately on the
             other side of the bridge, a number of citizens are
             attempting to jump the gorge with their cars.  It's a
             silent testament to the never-give-up and never-think-
             things-out spirit of our citizens.
       Kent: With our utter annihilation imminent, our federal
             government has snapped into action.  We go live now via
             satellite to the floor of the United States congress.
    Speaker: Then it is unanimous, we are going to approve the bill to
             evacuate the town of Springfield in the great state of --
Congressman: Wait a minute, I want to tack on a rider to that bill: $30
             million of taxpayer money to support the perverted arts.
    Speaker: All in favor of the amended Springfield-slash-pervert bill?
              [everyone boos]
    Speaker: Bill defeated.  [bangs gavel]
       Kent: I've said it before and I'll say it again: democracy simply
             doesn't work.
-- Kent Brockman shows his true color: pink, 

 Kent: Now, over the years, a newsman learns a number of things that for
       one reason or another, he just cannot report.  It doesn't seem to
       matter now, so...the following people are gay.
        [a list flashes by hurriedly]
Marge: Turn it off!
Homer: [copying down the list quickly] Just a second...
-- Homer and his useless lists, 

Homer: What's everyone so worked up about?  So there's a comet -- big
       deal.  It'll burn up in our atmosphere and what's ever left will
       be no bigger than a chihuahua's head.
 Bart: Wow, Dad, maybe you're right.
Homer: Of course I'm right.  If I'm not, may we all be horribly crushed
       from above somehow.
        [everyone groans]
       OK, if you're that worried about it, let's go down to the bomb
       shelter.
 Lisa: We have a bomb shelter?
Homer: Homer Simpson takes care of _his_ family.
        [the family goes outside]
Homer: [pounding on a door] Flanders!  Open up.
-- Homer, living vicariously through Ned, 

  Ned: Heidy-hoeroony, neighbor.  What can I do you for?
Homer: Get out of there.  My family needs to use your bomb shelter.
Marge: Homer!
  Ned: Uh oh, I kind of figured this might happen, so I built the
       shelter big enough for both our families.
Homer: No deal.  Out.
Marge: Get in the shelter, Homer!
-- Homer rejects the first offer, 

The shadow of the comet looms over the city hall.  It looms over the
zoo, to the frightened protests of the animals.  Some penguins look at
one another and then suddenly develop the ability to fly.  A boy working
on his bike in the street leaves it there and hides under a park bench.
Other people abandon their cars in the middle of the road and run for
cover.

In Ned's bomb shelter, the two families sit around, bored.

Marge: [checks her watch] One more hour.
Homer: An hour?  I can't wait another hour.  What's keeping that stupid
       comet?
        [someone knocks on the door]
       Ah, there it is.
        [Ned answers it; the rest of Springfield stands outside]
  Ned: Well, howdily-doodily, neighbors.  Shouldn't you be in your
       shelterinis by now?
  Moe: [menacing] We haven't got shelterinis.  We want in yours!
  Ned: Well, ho ho, the shelter's kind of full.
  Moe: [not realizing] Really?  Oh.  Well, we'll just go off some place
       and die then.  Thanks.  [everyone walks off]
  Ned: Wait!  You know, I may regret this when our air runs out and we
       can't whistle _or_ stay alive, but...oh, what the hey.
        [everyone barges in]
-- Moe's bargaining tactics, 

The shelter is very crowded indeed with everyone there.

  Homer: I can't get the -- [struggles] -- I can't get the door closed.
         Somebody's going to have to get out.
   Lisa: [muffled] I'd get out but I don't know where I am.
 Barney: Hey!  Somebody's touching me.
Skinner: I am.
 Barney: [happy] Oh, OK.
-- Ned's shelter brims over capacity, 

Krusty, ever resourceful, comes up with a plan.

 Krusty: OK, OK, let's figure out who should stay.  The world of the
         future will need laughter, so I'm in.
    Moe: And they'll need somebody to dispense drinks, i.e., me, and
         someone'll have to run the power.  You can do that, Homer.
  Homer: [uncertain] Uh, yeah...I can do that.
          [the comet looms ever closer]
Lovejoy: OK, let's start again.  We'll need laughter, religious
         enlightenment, gossip -- that's Mrs. Lovejoy --
-- Predicting the future world necessities, 

Homer: Wait a minute: we all know the one thing we won't need in the
       future!  Left-handed stores.  That's you, Flanders!
        [whispered to Rod &amp; Todd] I'm terribly story.
        [to everyone] Flanders is the only useless person here.  If
       anyone dies, it should be him.
        [whispered] I'm sorry, please forgive me.
        [to everyone] So let's kick Flanders out.
        [whispered] Sorry.
  Ned: Well sir, sounds fair.  Toodleloo, everybody; I'll scream when
       the comet gets here.
Maude: Oh, I'm coming with you, Neddy.
  Ned: No, sweetheart, you...you stay here because --
Maude: [quickly] OK.
  Ned: I might go mad with fear out there, so Todd, I want you to shoot
       Daddy if he tries to get back in.
 Todd: OK, Dad.  [weeps]
  Ned: OK.  [sings on his way out] Que sera sera, whatever will be, will
       be, the future's not ours to see...
-- Ned, closed fatalist, 

Moe suggests something to lighten the mood.

       Moe: Hey, uh, I got an idea: we can play a game to pass the time.
            Er, I'll make the sound of a barnyard animal, and, er, you
            all try to guess what it is.  Ahem: [makes some
            unidentifiable noise]
    Wiggum: It's a pig!
      Bart: It's a cow, man.
      Lisa: It's a pony.
    Krusty: No, it's a goat.  You know, one of them lady goats.
     Selma: There are no lady goats: a lady goat is a sheep.
   Hibbert: I believe she's right.
      Otto: You're crazy.
McAllister: Arr, what's it to you?
      Otto: What's it to _me_?
             [everyone starts arguing]
     Marge: Stop it!  Stop it!  Can't you see this barnyard noise
            guessing game is tearing us apart?
             [Ned still sings "Que Sera, Sera" outside]
            Say, Moe, was it a duck?
             [everyone argues again]
-- The final hour before the comet hits, 

Homer calls for order.

  Homer: Shut up!  Shut up!  Stop it!  Stop it.  I can't take this any
         more.  I can't let that brave man out there die alone.  I'm
         surprised and disgusted by all of you -- especially his
         children.  I'm going out there!
          [goes out, slams door behind him]
          [pops his head back in] It was a baby ox.
    Moe: He's right, you know.
Skinner: [surprised] About the ox?
    Moe: About everything, dammit.  Hey Homer, wait up.  I want to die
         too.
    Apu: If you are going, I am going.
 Barney: Me too!
          [everyone assents and leaves]
-- Never-think-things-through, indeed, 

Ned stands alone on a hilltop, singing to himself.

     Ned: [singing] When I was just a little girl,
          I asked my mother, "What will I be?
          Will I be pretty?  Will I be rich?"
          Here's what she said to me:
Everyone: [joining in] Que sera, sera,
          Whatever will be, will be
          The future's not ours to see
          Que sera --
  Quimby: [pointing at the comet] Run!
-- Forced bravado, 

The comet speeds towards Springfield, through the polluted atmosphere.
Chunks of it start to fly off.  "Look!" cries Marge, "It's breaking up!"
yells Lisa.  The rapidly diminishing-in-size comet punctures the Skinner
weather balloon, then places a direct hit on Ned's bomb shelter --
destroying it in a pile of masonry.

    Bart: Cool.  [picks up what's left of the comet]
    Lisa: We're saved!
Everyone: Yay!
   Selma: Sure makes you appreciate the preciousness of life.
           [she and Patty light a cigarette and puff contentedly]
     Moe: Let's go burn down the observatory so this will never happen
          again.
-- Moe's miracle cure, 

Lisa is astounded.

 Lisa: I can't believe that extra-thick layer of pollution that I've
       actually picketed against burned up the comet.
 Bart: But what's really amazing, is that this is _exactly_ what Dad
       said would happen.
 Lisa: Yeah, Dad was right.
Homer: I know, kids.  I'm scared too!
-- Homer "Nostradamus" Simpson, 

[End of Act Three.  Time: 20:57]

Over the closing credits, an orchestral version of "Que Sera, Sera"
plays.
 EPISODE TITLE: Homer the Clown


EPISODE SUMMARY: 
[Syndication cuts are marked in curly braces "{}" and are courtesy of
Frederic Briere.]

It's the Krusty the Klown Show.  Krusty rides out on a bicycle, in front
of the camera and off to the side.  He rides back on a smaller bike,
then a smaller one still, then a smaller one still, until he's riding a
bicycle no more than six inches tall.  He does a loop-the-loop around a
metal track without falling off, then poses triumphantly on one knee,
tossing the bicycle into the air and swallowing it.  The children cheer
happily.

Lisa: When Krusty wants to, he can still blow 'em away.
Bart: Yes.  He can take a simple, everyday thing like eating a bicycle
      and make it funny.
-- Bart and Lisa marvel at the Klown, 

"See you tomorrow, kids!"  Krusty laughs, "but before I go, I'd just
like to say --" He opens his mouth and a bicycle bell rings.  The
children cheer; Krusty waves as the curtain falls.  Once it falls, his
grin turns somber.  He pulls out a pack of cigarettes.

Krusty: Ah, there's nothing better than a cigarette...unless it's a
        cigarette lit with a $100 bill!
         [tosses a burning $100 bill away]
         [hands bundles of cash to his aides] Put five thousand bucks on
        the Lakers.  Hire Kenny G to play for me in the elevator.  My
        house is dirty; buy me a clean one.
         [walks into his office, closes the door]
  Bill: Krusty, as your accountant, I must warn you your spending --
Krusty: Did you send those thousand roses to Bea Arthur's grave?
  Bill: [exasperated] Yes, but she's still --
Krusty: I don't want to hear the end of any sentences!
 Woman: [over intercom] George Carlin on three.
Krusty: [answers it] Yeah?...Lawsuit?  Oh, come on.  My "Seven Words You
        Can't Say on TV" bit was _entirely_ different from _your_ "Seven
        Words You Can't Say on TV" bit.  ...So I'm a thief, am I?  Well,
        excuuuse me!  [to his accountant] Give him ten grand.
 Woman: Steve Martin on four.
Krusty: Ten grand.
-- Krusty learns the value of paying people off, 

Just then, Fat Tony walks into Krusty's office, two of his henchmen in
tow.

  Tony: Krusty, with regards to the large wager you made on yesterday's
        horse race --
Krusty: Aw, come on, let -- how about letting me go double or nothing on
        the big opera tonight?
  Tony: Who do you like?
Krusty: The tenor!
  Tony: [thinks] OK.  But we're only letting the bet ride because you
        crack us so consistently up.
-- Krusty's gambling racketeers, 

Fat Tony and his men leave.

     Bill: You've got to stop blowing your money like this, Krusty.
   Krusty: No can do.
            [lights a cigarette with an original Superman comic]
     Bill: And those ridiculous bets you make...gambling is the finest
           thing a person can do _if_ he's good at it, but you haven't
           won anything in months.
   Krusty: So?  I'll just make some more money.  Crank out some cheesy
           merchandise.
     Bill: But you've already merchandised everything: Krusty's Monopoly
           Game, the Krusty Krowd Kontrol Barrier..._nothing_ is selling
           any more, not even your new Lady Krusty line.
   Krusty: But our infomercials are running 24 hours a day!
            [flips TV on]
            [a woman goes over her upper lip with a chomping Krusty
           shaver-type thing]
   Johnny: So, what do you think of the Lady Krusty Mustache Removal
           System now, Angelique?
Angelique: It's Krusteriffic, Johnny Unitas.  But is my upper lip
           supposed to bleed like this?
   Johnny: Probably.
-- Truth in advertising, 

  Bill: At this rate you'll be broke in a month.  The only thing left to
        do is...open a Clown College and train some regional Krustys.
Krusty: You mean like that bozo, Bonko the Clown?
  Bill: Exactly.
Krusty: Forget it.  I'll just cut back on the condor egg omelettes.
        Mmm, a couple of those would be tasty right now.
  Bill: I'll found the college tomorrow.
         [Krusty lights a cigarette with a string of pearls]
-- Endangered omelettes, 

In the middle of driving down the highway, Homer skids to a halt in
front of a billboard.

 Homer: [gasps] It must be the first of the month: new billboard day!
         [a car-carrying truck stops behind him]
         [a bunch of cars drive onto it accidentally]
Driver: Heh heh heh...finders keepers.  [drives off]
 Homer: [reading] "This year, give her English muffins."  Whatever you
        say, Mr. Billboard!  [skids off]
         [stops suddenly at another billboard for barbeque sauce]
         [cars collide behind him and explode]
 Homer: [reading] "Best in the West."  Heh heh heh, that rhymes!
         [looking at the next one] "Clown college"?  You can't eat that.
-- Homer's billboard-judging criteria, 

At the power plant, Homer piles his purchases (including MSG, "Best in
the West", and English muffins) at his work station.  "Well, I got
everything I was supposed to get.  I'm not going to enroll in that clown
college, though...that advertisement had absolutely no effect on me
whatsoever.  In his daydream, he imagines himself sleeping and dreaming
of himself eating a sandwich.  The billboard for the clown college
batters its way into his thoughts.  The Krustys on the billboard start
dancing to circus music.

Lenny walks in: "Hey, Homer: the section you're supposed to be
monitoring is on fire."  Through Homer's eyes, Lenny is a dancing clown.
Four clowns roll out of a safety door and start dancing sitting down (in
actuality, it's Charlie and three other men trying to put out their
burning clothes).  Homer chuckles to himself.  "Clowns are funny..."

At dinner that night, Homer scoops a large pile of mashed potatoes onto
his plate and shapes it carefully into a circus tent with his fork.
"Mom?"  Lisa asks worriedly.  "I think I'll have some wine," responds
Marge.  Homer looks up to see his family dressed like clowns, holding
miniature billboards advertising the clown college and dancing to circus
music.  "Marge...?" asks Homer slowly.  "Yes, Homey?" answers the clown
Marge, starting to hum circus music.

Homer: That's it!  You people have stood in my way long enough.  I'm
       going to clown college!  [leaves]
 Bart: I don't think any of us expected him to say that.
-- 

{Marge dresses Homer in a grey suit.}

Homer: {Hurry up!  It's my first day of clown college.}
Marge: {Hold still, Homer.  Don't squirm!}
Homer: {[squirming] I _am_ holding still.  I _am_ squirming.}
 Bart: {Dad, you can't just go around pretending to be Krusty, it's
       sacrilege.  He's a one-and-only.  I mean, he invented the pie-
       fight, the pratfall, and the seltzer bottle, as far as I know.}
 Lisa: {Yeah, Dad, it was bad enough when you tried to pass yourself off
       as Tom Bosley, but Krusty?}
Homer: {You weren't complaining when I got you this close to Chachi.}
 Bart: {[pauses] [looks at Lisa] What's a Chachi?}
-- It's like a hibachi, only funnier, 

At Krusty's Clown College (formerly Willie Nelson's house), Krusty
addresses the enrollees.

 Krusty: All right, now there can only be one Krusty in each territory,
         so I hope this works out.  Tell me where you're from.
  Man 1: Georgia.
Texan 1: Texas.
Texan 2: Uh, Brooklyn.
  Man 2: Russia.
  Man 3: New Hampshire.
  Homer: Homer.
-- Homer from Bonerland, 

Krusty: OK, we'll start off with the baggy -- wha?  [sees Homer] Those
        are supposed to be baggy pants.  Baggy!
 Homer: Ooh.  I've never had a pair of pants that fit this well in my
        life.
         [back in the classroom]
Krusty: OK, memorize these funny place names: Walla Walla.  Keokuk.
        Cucamonga.  Seattle --
 Homer: [laughs] Stop it, you're killing me!  [laughs more] Seattle.
Krusty: [groans]
-- The trials of teaching Homer, 

Krusty: And now, everybody's favorite, the Spin Cycle Fantastique trick!
        It's a great piece of buffoonery if you pull it off, but if you
        blow it, you'll look like a fool.
         [Homer gets on the little bike and wobbles]
 Homer: Steady...steady...[crashes through ramp]
         [back in class]
Krusty: Now, when the wealthy dowager comes in, the party's over, right?
        Wrong!
         [throws pie into dowager's face; her head cracks the wall]
 Homer: [taking notes] Kill wealthy dowager.
-- The trials of teaching Homer, part deux, 

Homer tries the Spin Cycle trick again, but his pants get caught in the
pedals and pulled off him.  "Burn that seat," Krusty orders.

Back in class...

Krusty: These Krusty brand balloons are three bucks each.  But get a
        cheap one and what happens?  It goes off, takes out the eyeballs
        of every kid in the room!  What's _that_ going to cost you?
         [to accountant] Hey, Bill, what did that cost us?
-- Krusty teaches balloon animal art, 

Homer tries the Spin Cycle trick once more, but when he gets to the ramp
the torsion twists it around his body.

At home, Homey puts the finishing touches on his clown makeup.  To his
credit, he looks just like Krusty except for the missing tuft of green
hair on his head.  Turning around, he sprays Bart in the face with
Seltzer.

 Bart: Wow, I'm sorry I doubted you before, Dad.
 Lisa: If there had to be a bastardized version of Krusty, I'm glad it's
       you.
Homer: Thanks, honey.  Bank shot!
        [bounces seltzer off Bart's cheek and onto Lisa]
 Lisa: Wow!  That's good aim, Dad.
Homer: Well, it _was_ my major.
-- With a minor in dirty limericks, 

Graduation day arrives.  Krusty addresses the first class.

Krusty: Welcome to the noble family of skilled Krustaceans.  You will
        now go back to your home towns and do kids' parties, swap meets,
        and all the other piddling crap I wouldn't touch with a ten foot
        clown pole.  Now, come and get your catskins -- er, I mean,
        sheepskins.
         [everyone lines up]
         [Krusty hands out the first one]
         [he shakes the man's hand and shocks him with a joy buzzer]
   Man: [walking up] This is the happiest day of my li -- ow!
Krusty: Heh heh.
 Homer: [grabs his diploma] Got it!  No shock for me, hee hee!  [runs
        off]
Krusty: Oh yeah?
         [Krusty pounces on him and shocks him repeatedly]
-- Those goofy clown graduations, 

[End of Act One.  Time: 7:56]

A pile of giant hamburgers rests in front of a new Krusty Burger
restaurant.  An assembled crowd of children cheer.

   Emcee: And now, to help introduce our fantastic new burger -- the one
          with ketchup -- here he is, coming in by parachute: Krusty the
          Klown!
           [sound of Homer yelling, getting rapidly louder]
           [he smashes through the hamburger display; his parachute
          floats gently after him]
   Homer: [dazed] [laughs like Krusty]
Children: Yay!
   Homer: [reading monotonically] "To audience: I now proclaim this new
          burger...for sale!"
Children: Yay!
   Homer: [sees emcee motioning, laughs like Krusty]
           [Homer does some inept cartwheels] Oh...save me.
Children: Yay!
           [a midget in a prison outfit and mask walks out]
   Child: It's the Krusty Burglar!
   Homer: Ohmigod!  He's stealing all the burglars!  Why you little --
          [jumps Krusty Burglar, starts pummeling him]
   Emcee: Oh, Homer, it -- it's all -- it -- it's all j -- jus -- just
          an act!
   Child: [crying] Stop!  Stop, he's already dead.
           [two men drag Homer off]
   Emcee: Er, Krusty the Klown, everybody!
           [a few children clap; the rest are too horrified]
 Burglar: Please look at my Medic Alert bracelet...
-- The dedication that shouldn't have been, 

Homer drives off to his next engagement -- a birthday party at
Milhouse's.  The children cheer as he skids onto the lawn, losing a tire
and crashing into a tree.  A second later, he flies out the windshield
and lands face down in front of the porch.  "Hey, hey," he moans weakly.

   Homer: [folding a balloon incompetently] And then, take that...and...
          put that in there, and you...ah!  There's your giraffe, little
          girl.
   Ralph: I'm a boy!
   Homer: That's the spirit.  Never give up.
Milhouse: Well, I guess you're pretty impressed, huh, Bart?  _My_ Dad
          got Krusty the Klown to personally appear at my party.
    Bart: Ehh, I have a feeling I could get him to appear at my house.
Milhouse: Ho ho, I don't know, Bart.  My Dad's a pretty big wheel down
          at the cracker factory.
-- A big salted wheel, that is, 

Homer dances in front of the children while they throw stuff that
splatters at him.  He gets sick of it soon enough, and collapses into an
arm chair.  "Uh, it's not 5:30 yet," Mr. Van Houten reminds him, so
Homer gets back up and dances some more.

At work, Homer sits tiredly at his station.

Lenny: Hey: nice threads.
Homer: Whew, I'm beat.  And after work I've got to dedicate a new Jiffy
       Lube and cohost the Ace Awards.
Lenny: Wow!  Jiffy Lube!
 Carl: Boy, you're really running yourself ragged.
Homer: Yeah.  When I started this clown thing, I thought it would be
       nothing but glory.  You know, the glory of being a clown.  I tell
       you, it's hard, tiring work.  But when I see the smiles on their
       little faces, I just know they're getting ready to jab me with
       something.
-- Clowning breeds cynicism, 

At the Ace Awards, Dick Cavett stands at the podium.

     Dick: Well, my time's almost up here, so, uh, I'd just like to
           say...I know Woody Allen.
            [a couple of people clap halfheartedly]
    Homer: And now the winner for the most promising new series on
           cable: "Old Starsky and Hutches".  [funky music starts]
Announcer: Accepting the award is the son of the guy who played Huggy
           Bear.
            [after the show]
     Dick: Let's walk and talk.  I, uh, I have some wonderful stories
           about other famous people that include me in some way.
    Homer: Er, can't, I gotta go distract bulls at a rodeo.
     Dick: Hey, me too.  We can go together.
    Homer: Um...no, I'm going a different way than you, Dick.
     Dick: Heh heh, your...churlish attitude reminds me of a time I was
           having dinner with Groucho and --
    Homer: Look, you're going to be having dinner with Groucho tonight
           if you don't beat it.
-- Homer does the Ace Awards, 

Homer rues his decision to become a clown on the drive.

 Homer: Aw, being a clown sucks.  You get kicked by kids, bit by dogs,
        and admired by the elderly.  Who am I clowning?  I have no
        business being a clown!  I've leaving the clowning business to
        all the other clowns in the clowning business.
         [a siren sounds behind him]
        Aw, no.
Wiggum: [getting out of his car] Well, well, well, Velocity Boy, I'm
        going to give you the biggest ticket you -- hey!  Krusty!
 Homer: I'm not Krusty.
Wiggum: Oh, to think I was going to give _you_ a ticket.  Krusty the
        Klown.
 Homer: [annoyed] I am _not_ Krusty!
Wiggum: Hey Krusty, Krusty, remember the time we got loaded and set
        those beavers loose in that pine furniture store?  [laughs] Ah,
        memories.  [rips ticket up] All right, you take it easy, Krusty.
         [drives off]
 Homer: Hey, he didn't give me a ticket!  This is an intriguing
        development...
-- Intriguing, indeed, 

Homer discovers just how intriguing at the Kwik-E-Mart.

Homer: [gasps] You mean I get five percent off on everything in the
       store just because I look like -- I mean, just because I _am_
       Krusty the Klown?
  Apu: How could I charge full price to the man whose lust for filthy
       magazines kept me in business during that first shaky year?
       [quietly] Oh, by the way, here is your new issue of "Gigantic
       Asses".
        [holds up magazine with a large butt on it]
-- The upside of mistaken identities, 

Homer takes his family to Luigi's restaurant.

   Homer: I'm telling you Marge, this will work.  They'll think I'm
          Krusty and give us free stuff.  I've been getting free stuff
          all day!  Look at this swell bucket of house paint.  [holds
          one up] Look at it!
   Marge: I'm not saying it won't work, I'm just saying it's dishonest.
   Homer: Well if we agree, then why are we arguing?
           [they walk into the restaurant]
   Luigi: Hey, Krusty!  Hey, ooh, beautiful date-a tonight, huh?  And
          such-a lovely children you have-a now.
    Bart: I'm more striking than lovely.
   Luigi: You come-a with me -- come-a with Luigi!  You don't want to
          sit with the rest of these-a scum.
Everyone: Hey!  What do you call that? etc.
   Luigi: I only-a consider you scum compared-a to Krusty.
Everyone: Ah!  Oh, well, right.  I can see that, etc.
   Luigi: Yeah, you see how you scum.
-- Homer (er, Krusty) takes the family for dinner, 

Krusty's woes with Fat Tony continue.  He and Bill watch TV with Fat
Tony and his two henchmen.

  Bill: Let me get this straight: you took all the money you made
        franchising your name and bet it against the Harlem
        Globetrotters?
Krusty: Oh, I thought the Generals were due!
         [TV shows a Globetrotter spinning the ball as Generals watch]
        He's spinning the ball on his finger!  Just take it, take the
        ball.
         [the Globetrotter kicks it into the net behind him]
        That game was fixed.  They were using a freakin' ladder, for
        gods' sakes.
-- Krusty learns the Globetrotter truth the hard way, 

  Tony: I am afraid the time has come for you to pay us.
Krusty: Look, I'm cleaned out.  Just take the Clown College.
  Tony: We have already taken it.
         [at the college]
   Man: Kids have a lot of money these days.  So after you finish your
        performance, you might consider robbing them.
Krusty: Look, what did I tell you?  You can't get blood from a turnip.
        You want to kill me?  Go ahead and kill me.
         [someone starts firing at him]
        Oh!  Hey!  Hey, all right, OK, already!  [firing stops] Look, we
        can talk this over.
  Tony: No more talk.  It is time for us to take you for a ride.
Krusty: Oh, no...mind if I go to the bathroom first?
  Tony: I see no harm in that.
         [Krusty runs off, slams the bathroom door]
         [a window slides open; a car speeds away; a plane flies
        overhead]
  Legs: When he's done in there, I gotta go.
-- 

[End of Act Two.  Time: 14:45]

Fat Tony and his henchmen go cruising for Krusty.

      Tony: OK, wherever Krusty's gone, we'll find him.  Legs, you check
            out the East Side.  Louie, Rome and Budapest.  Tell the boys
            I want a total world search.
Legs+Louie: Right, boss.
     Homer: [at a car dealer] I want a free car because I'm Krusty.
            Krusty the Klown?  Get it?  Krus -- [honks horn] -- ty!
            [honk]
             [Tony's car skids to a halt]
      Tony: Cancel the world search.
     Homer: I want everything that's coming to Krusty the Klown.  Which
            is me, Krusty!
     Louie: [behind a fence with a rifle] Hey!  It's Krusty, all right.
            Should I shoot him gangland-style or execution-style?
      Tony: Listen to your heart.
  Salesman: Well I can't _give_ you the car, Krusty, but I _can_ let you
            have this little number for practically nothing: only
            $38,000.
             [bullets hit the car]
     Homer: [suspicious] Hey, what are all these holes?
  Salesman: [quickly] These are speed holes.  They make the car go
            faster.
     Homer: Oh, yeah.  Speed holes!
             [bullets riddle the car and smash the windshield]
  Salesman: You want my advice?  I think you should buy this car.
-- Instant depreciation, 

"We need more ammo," notes Fat Tony, "let's go to Big 5."

Krusty has gone to Switzerland for plastic surgery.

Doctor: Krusty, your plastic surgery is complete.  Now, when I remove
        the bandages, don't be alarmed by the total stranger staring
        back at you.  [hands him a mirror]
Krusty: Aah!  I look exactly the same, you moron!
Doctor: Ho ho, nonsense, Krusty: you look at least ten years younger!
        Plus, I did your breasts.
Krusty: Does anyone hear me complaining about the breasts?  Oh, what's
        the use?  I gotta go back to Springfield and face the music.
        Can you loan me bus fair?
         [the doctor stuffs a bill in Krusty's new cleavage]
         [offended] Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
-- 

Homer, meanwhile, uses a pickaxe to make some speed holes in his own
car.

  Ned: Whatcha diddely-doin', neighbor?
Homer: Aw, putting speed holes in my car.  Makes it go faster.
  Ned: Is that so?  Well, gee, maybe the old Flanders-mobile could use
       some -- [a shot rings out] aah!  [Ned collapses]
        [he gets up slowly] Wow!  Lucky I always keep a bible close to
       my heart -- [boom!] aah!  [Ned collapses]
        [he gets up] Ho ho, lucky I was wearing an extra large piece of
       the True Cross today.  I think I'll go inside.
        [a shot hits Homer's pick axe]
Homer: What keeps doing that?
 Tony: I told you we should have bought more than three bullets.  Let's
       just grab him!
-- Louie the henchman, not the marksman, 

In the car, Homer pleads with his captors.

Homer: But wait...you can't kill me for being Krusty the Klown.  I'm not
       him...I'm Homer Simpson!
 Tony: The same Homer Simpson who crashed his car through the wall of
       our club?
Homer: Uh, actually, my name is Barney.  Yeah, Barney Gumbel.
 Legs: The same Barney Gumbel who keeps taking picture of my sister?
Homer: Uh, actually, my _real_ name is, uh -- think, Krusty, think!  --
       Joe Valachi!
Louie: The same Joe Valachi who squealed to the Senate Committee about
       Organized Crime?
        [later]
Homer: Benedict Arnold!
 Legs: The same Benedict Arnold who plotted to surrender West Point to
       the hated British?
Homer: D'oh!
-- Homer "Fletch" Simpson, 

Homer is sat in a chair and a bright spotlight shone on him.  An elderly
man in a black coat walks in.

Vittorio: I am so glad I had a chance to meet you before we did this,
          Krusty, because I am a great fan.  [holds out hand] Don
          Vittorio DiMaggio.
   Homer: [sadly] Krusty the Klown.
Vittorio: Sorry I have to do this, Krusty.  [pulls a gun]
           [points it at Homer, cocks trigger]
          I cannot do it.  To murder a funny man of such genius would be
          a crime.  Ah, tell you what, Krusty: do for me my favorite
          trick where you ride the little bike for me through the loop,
          and I will let you live.
   Homer: Oh, but I've never been able to do that --
           [trigger is cocked] Hey, how about if I just squirt you in
          the face with my boutoniere?
           [trigger cocks more] OK.
-- The power of persuasion, 

Homer grabs a little bike and frets, "I'll never be able to do this
trick.  Never!"  At Vittorio's prodding, he balances on the bike and
succeeds in riding it towards the loop.  "Hey!  I'm doing it, I'm doing
it!" he cries gleefully, riding up the loop -- but as he gets to the
top, he slides back down to the bottom again.  "Ta da," he finishes
lamely.

Vittorio: The fact that you did not do the trick well is the biggest
          insult of all -- [cocks gun]
  Krusty: [bursting in] Hey guys, I came to -- oh, you've got a deadly
          game of cat and mouse going.  I'll come back.
    Legs: [gasps] I'm seeing double here: four Krustys!
   Homer: Krusty!  Oh thanks, thanks a lot.  You came here to save me!
  Krusty: [slowly] Yeah, that's what I did.
Vittorio: My apologies to you.  I almost made a grievous error.  [cocks
          gun at Krusty] Goodbye, Krusty.
  Krusty: Wait: he can't kill anybody if he doesn't know which one is
          the real Krusty.
           [grabs Homer by the head and plays the shell game with
          himself and Homer]
Vittorio: I am confused.
   Homer: Heh heh.  Good one, Krusty.
           [Vittorio cocks the gun at Krusty]
  Krusty: Oh, crap.
-- That's putting it mildly, 

Vittorio menaces, "Because of that disrespectful display, I shall now
kill both of you -- unless you _both_ go through the loop...together!"
The two klowns moan at the thought, but they try it, Krusty riding,
Homer perched on top.  In his fear and in his attempt to hold tight,
Homer covers Krusty's eyes with his hands.  Krusty admonishes him, but
they miss the loop entirely and ride up a pool cue right onto the pool
table.  They ride straight into the racked-up Boston balls -- and sink
every one of them.  The Italians are visibly impressed.

The antics don't stop there, however.  The two klowns jump across a gap
onto the bar; Homer's head plays "The Godfather" theme music on the wine
glasses that dangle from the roof.  "Ah!" gasp the Italians.  Krusty
sees that the part of the bar that lifts up so the bartender can get out
is raised.  Thinking quickly, he knocks it closed with seltzer.  The
Italians even applaud, but Vittorio moans, "Ah, but without the loop it
is nothing," cocking his gun again.

He's spoken too quickly -- Krusty and Homer fly off the bar, straight
towards the loop, and whizz around and around it many times.  They fly
off together and skillfully land in the "Ta da!" pose; the miniature
bike flies towards them, and Krusty, although he opens his mouth to
catch it, is beaten to the punch by Homer, who swallows it and makes the
bell ring by opening his mouth.

Italians: Yay, Krustys!  [applauding]
Vittorio: Grazie, grazie.  You have a brought great joy to this old
          Italian stereotype.
    Legs: No, no, Don Vittorio, you're not --
Vittorio: Yes, I am, I know it, I am.  Anyway, thank you, Krusty.
  Krusty: You're welcome.  So, uh, we're even now, huh?
Vittorio: No, we just won't kill you.  But you still owe us the money.
          [ominous] $48.
  Krusty: [hands him a bill] Here's $50.
Vittorio: And two your change, and we thank you.
-- Come again!, 

[End of Act Three.  Time: 20:57]
 EPISODE TITLE: Bart vs. Australia


EPISODE SUMMARY: 
[Syndication cuts are marked in curly braces "{}" and are courtesy of
Frederic Briere.]

Bart and Lisa kneel on either side of the sink, squeezing bottles into
it.

 Bart: Go, toothpaste, go!  Move your pasty white butt.
 Lisa: Come on, shampoo!  You can do it!
        [both swirl down the sink, shampoo first]
       Yay!  I won your stupid bathroom products race.
 Bart: No fair!  You only won because you had the inside track.  If the
       water was spinning the other way --
 Lisa: It _never_ spins the other way.  In the Northern hemisphere,
       water always drains counterclockwise.  It's called the Coriolis
       Effect.
 Bart: No way.  Water doesn't obey your _rules_: it goes where it
       wants...like me, babe.
 Lisa: Yes, _Bart_...why don't you try it and see?
        [Bart turns the tap on; water swirls counterclockwise]
 Bart: I _know_ I've seen it go the other way.  Ah, faithful toilet:
       you'll prove me right.
        [flushes it repeatedly; groans as it swirls counterclockwise]
Homer: [elsewhere] I'm a singin' in the show --!  Ow!  Hot...aah!  Cold!
       Oh!  Hot!  Cold!  Hot!  Oh!  Who's...doing...that?
Marge: [walking into upstairs bathroom, seeing Bart pushing the water
       the other way] Oh, for Pete's sake, Bart, use the plunger!
-- Marge, uncharacteristically, misinterprets Bart's behavior, "Bart vs.
    Australia"

Lisa continues to try to explain the observed phenomenon to her less-
than-brilliant brother.

Lisa: Bart, water will only go the other way in the Southern hemisphere.
Bart: What the hell is the "Southern hemisphere"?
Lisa: [sighs] Haven't you ever looked at your globe?
       [said globe is still wrapped for Bart's birthday from Abe]
Lisa: [pointing] See, the Southern hemisphere is made up of everything
      below the equa --
       [stops, sees Bart looking blankly]
      -- this line.
Bart: Hmm.  [spins globe] So down there in, say, Argentina, or...[reads
      logo] Rand McNally, all their water runs backwards?
Lisa: Uh huh.  In fact, in Rand McNally, they wear hats on their feet
      and hamburgers eat people.
Bart: Cool!
-- Impressionable youth, 

Bart grabs the phone book and looks under "International Dialing".  He
dials 577562374257635623567462357736257635725 (those darn country codes)
for Antarctica and awaits an answer.

 Bart: Hello, Southern hemisphere?  Which way does the water go in your
       toilet?
Man 1: [sighs] Just a minute, I'll check.
        [walks into bathroom; toilet water is frozen]
Man 2: [walking in with a magazine] Aw, nuts.
-- Bart checks with Antarctica, 

Next, Bart dials a palatial-looking building in a jungle.  {The view of
the building is cut for one second.}

      Aide: Please to repeat again and I will translating for the el
            presidente.
      Bart: [slowly] Which way does the water turn in your toilet?
      Aide: [in Spanish] He says the tide is turning!
Presidente: Ay, caramba!  Then the rebels will soon take the capital.  I
            must flee!  [dives out window]
-- Bart checks with Argentina, 

Bart rues his luck.

 Bart: I can't get a straight answer out of this crazy hemisphere.
        [tries another number]
        [a phone rings in a car in a foreign country]
Adolf: Eine minuten, eine minuten!  [ringing stops]
       Ach!  Das facken phone ist ein...nuisance phone!
  Man: [riding by on penny farthing bicycle] Buenos notches, mein
       fuehrer.
Adolf: Ja, Ja.
-- Bart checks with Argentina, 

A pay phone sticking out of a sea of lava rings.  A man sitting on the
roof of his house floats by; he reaches for the phone but falls
screaming into the lava.

    Lisa: [walking in] Bart, you can't actually _call_ these places.
          Don't you know how expensive international calls are?
    Bart: [dials] Hello, Operator?  I'd like to make a collect call to
           [in Australia, a phone rings; a koala electrocutes itself]
Operator: This is the international operator.  Will you accept a collect
          call from --
    Bart: [lowering voice] Uh, yes.  Uh, ahem, this is Dr. Bart Simpson
          of the International Drainage Commission.  It's an emergency.
  Tobias: If it's an emergency, then.
    Bart: We understand some drains in your area have been
          malfunctioning, sucking in people and...whatnot.
  Tobias: Willikers!  That's awful.
    Bart: [gravely] Indeed.  We need you to check your sinks and toilets
          and tell us which way the water is going, and please!  Stand
          clear.
           [Tobias checks sink and toilet]
  Tobias: [breathless] The fixtures...they're all draining clockwise,
          Sir!
    Bart: D'oh, she was right, stupid Lisa science queen.
-- Bart forgets his sisters' mental superiority, 

    Bart: Look, why don't you just check your neighbor's drains?  I'll
          hold.
           [Tobias rides trike off down long dirt road]
Milhouse: [at the window] Hey, Bart!  The bakery caught fire and all of
          downtown smells like cookies!  Wanna go smell?
    Bart: Yes...yes, I do.  [leaves phone off hook]
           [later that night, Bart walks back into the kitchen]
           ["Hello!  Sir!  Sir!" is heard from phone, still off the
          hook]
    Bart: [picking up phone] Huh?
  Tobias: I've returned from the Koolamuggerys' place...they're draining
          clockwise too!
    Bart: Draining?  I don't care about that any more.
  Tobias: Are we in any dang --
           [Bart hangs up]
-- Short Attention Span Simpson, 

"Three Weeks Later," says a caption on the screen, as Homer sits on the
couch and reads a phone bill.

Homer: Burkina Faso?  Disputed Zone?  Who called all these weird places?
Brain: Quiet, it might be you!  I can't remember.
Homer: Naw, I'm going to ask Marge.
Brain: No, no!  Why embarrass us both?  Just write a check and I'll
       release some more endorphins.
        [Homer scribbles a check, then sighs with pleasure]
-- Bart's tomfoolery is paid for once again, 

In Australia, however, the picture isn't nearly so rosy.

 Bruno: Nine hundred dollary-doos?  Tobias!  Did you accept a six hour
        collect call from the States?
Tobias: It was an emergency call from the International Drainage
        Commission in Springfield.
 Bruno: Oh my God!  There's nothing wrong with the bidet, is there?
-- A fate worse than death, 

Bart's phone rings in the middle of the night.

 Bart: [sleepy] Hello?
Bruno: Right!  I'm calling all the way from Squatter's Crog, Australia
       and I want to speak to, er, Dr. Bart Simpson right now.
 Bart: Uh...[plugs nose] hold, please.
Bruno: All right, but I don't --
 Bart: [low voice] Payroll, Bert Stanton speaking.
Bruno: Oy!  I said "Bart Simpson".  What kind of a company is this?
 Bart: [high voice] Bart Simpson's office.
Bruno: Thank the great good Lord.  Look, I was just say --
 Bart: One moment please.  [hums "Raindrops Keep Falling on my Head"]
Bruno: Who do they think I am, some stupid Aussie drongo?  Bleedin'
       yanks, I oughta --
 Bart: This is Bart Simpson.  Can I help you, ma'am?
Bruno: Yeah, er -- hey!  My name is Bruno Drundridge, right?  You owe me
       $900, mate.
 Bart: No, you owe _me_ $900!
Bruno: [stammers] I...you...ooh!  You're just some punk kid, aren't you?
       Ooh, you picked the wrong guy to tangle with here, mate.
 Bart: [chuckles] I don't think so.  You're all the way in Australia.
       Hey!  I think I hear a dingo eating your baby.  [hangs up]
-- Bart cries in the dark, 

Bruno: Ooh!  Ah, that's it.  I'm going to report this to me member of
       parliament.  [yells out window] Hey, Gus!  I got something to
       report to you.
        [Gus tends his swine]
  Gus: That's a bloody outrage, it is!  I want to take this all the way
       to the Prime Minister.
        [they go down to a lake]
       Hey!  Mr. Prime Minister!  Andy!
 Andy: [floating naked on an inner tube with a beer] Eh, mates!  What's
       the good word?
-- The Australian governmental structure, 

In the US, Bart receives a letter: "Mr. Simpson, blah blah,
misrepresentation over telephone, yatta yatta, sincerely, some
Australian jerk."  Bart crumples it and tosses it into his garbage bin.
It's joined later by many more similar envelopes, each with an
increasingly dire warning stamped on the outside.  Finally, Bart's
garbage bin is full of letters, and he uses Lisa's saxophone to compress
them.

 Lisa: Hey, I need that!  [grabs her saxophone]
        [looks at letters in garbage] Office of the Solicitor General?
       Office of the Prime Minister?  Hopping Mad Collection Agency?
       What is all this stuff?
 Bart: Nothing.  Some stupid country thinks I owe them money.
 Lisa: Uh oh.  Bart, you better talk to Mom and Dad about this.
 Bart: [walking into TV room] Hey, guys?  Just so you don't hear any
       wild rumors, I'm being indicted for fraud in Australia.
Homer: [scoffs] That's no reason to block the TV.
Marge: Oh my...
-- Homer, to the point as usual, 

[End of Act One.  Time: 7:14]

Bart's parents question his actions.

Marge: Bart, did you trick an Australian boy into accepting a $900
       collect call?
 Bart: Yes, 'm.
Homer: [looking at globe] Hmm, there it is: Aus-tra-li-a.  I'll be
       damned.  [spins globe, laughs] Look at this country!  ["Uruguay"]
       U-R-Gay.  [laughs]
-- Homer, phonetic reader, 

An official-looking limousine pulls up in front of the house.  The
doorbell rings, and Marge answers it.

Conover: Oh, my.  Hello, I'm Evan Conover with the US State Department.
         [hands Marge his card]
  Marge: [reading] "Undersecretary for International Protocol: Brat and
         Punk Division."
Conover: Unfortunately, Bart, your little escapade could not have come
         at a worse time.  [sets up screen] Americo-Australianian
         relations are at an all-time low.
          [talks over a slide show]
         As I'm sure you remember, in the late 1980s the US experienced
         a short-lived infatuation with Australian culture.  For some
         bizarre reason, the Aussies thought this would be a permanent
         thing.  Of course, it wasn't.
          [a slide shows "Yahoo Serious Festival"]
   Lisa: I know those words, but that sign makes no sense.
Conover: Anyway, the Down Under fad fizzled and the diplomatic climate
         turned absolutely frosty.
          [a slide shows Castro in crosshairs: "Cuba Plan B"]
         Oops, let's pretend we didn't see this.  [swallows slide]
-- The US takes an unsavory route?  No, 

Conover: And Bart's childish taunting agitated the Aussies further.
  Homer: Oh, he'll agitate you.  Ho, ho!  He sure will.
          [laughs heartily, then less so, then sighs]
         What can we do for you?
Conover: Well, it's too late to merely pay back the money, but as a sign
         of good faith to our Australian friends, we'd like to imprison
         Bart for five years.
  Homer: [thinks briefly] That's tough but fair.  Boy, go with the man.
  Marge: [holds Bart to her] No, no, no!  No!  I'm not going to have my
         son go to jail over some silly tiff with Australia.  You'll
         just have to find some other country to have relations with.
Conover: You're sure, now?  The prison train is sailing.
          [Marge hugs Bart tighter]
         OK, I'm not hearing a lot of support for prison.
-- 

Conover: There _is_ one other option: they'll drop the charges if Bart
         makes a public apology in Australia.
  Homer: All Bart has to do is apologize and we get a free trip to
         Australia?
Conover: Mm, hmm.
   Bart: I can handle that: I'm an expert at phony apologies.
  Marge: [reproachful] Bart!
   Bart: [with phony sincerity] I'm sorry.
  Marge: That's better.
   Bart: Heh heh heh...
-- Bart, master of deceit, 

So the family take a flight on Transhemispheric Airlines.  The camera
pans through a cross section of the Earth, past coffins for humans and
dinosaurs, through the center of the planet where Vishnu operates
machinery and wipes sweat from his brow.

The family arrive at customs looking bedraggled.

Homer: Oh.  We left at 1:30pm Monday.  What time is it now?
 Lisa: It's 6:45am next Wednesday.  You may also be interested to know
       that it's summer here, not winter.
Homer: Oh!  [throws his sled away]
 Bart: What does that sign say?  ["Advisory: foreign florae and faunae
       prohibited!"]  I thought they spoke English here!
 Lisa: It says you can't bring in outside plants or animals.  Any
       foreign creature you bring in could upset the environmental
       balance.
 Bart: Oh.  [removes toad from bag] Sorry, girl.  I don't want to get
       into any more trouble down here.  I'll pick you up on the way
       home.  [puts it on the edge of a fountain]
-- Bart, ecosystem havoc-wreaker, 

At the US embassy, the family walk inside the wrought-iron gates.  Homer
spots a marine standing guard.

 Homer: Hey!  Are you like one of those English guards who can't laugh
        or smile or anything?  [makes noises and faces at him]
         [gets punched in the face] Ow!
Marine: No, Sir!  US Marine Corps, Sir!
-- Hello, Joker, 

The room at the embassy where the family get to stay is luxurious.

  Homer: Oh, yeah, this is the life!  Boy, next summer can you commit
         some fraud in Orlando, Florida?
   Bart: I'm way ahead of you, Dad.
Conover: [walking in] Kno-ock!  Simpsons, I'd like you to meet our
         ambassador, the honorable Avril Ward.
   Ward: Hello.  Now, everything is all set for Bart's apology.  Mr.
         Conover will meet you at the parliament house at three p.m.
         Questions?
   Bart: Yeah, do the toilets go backwards in here?
   Ward: No.  To combat homesickness, we've installed a device that
         makes them swirl the correct American way.
          [he flushes the toilet]
          [it swirls one way, then a machine kicks in and makes it swirl
         the other way]
  Homer: [singing] Sweet land of liberty, of thee I sing...[weeps]
-- A moment of patriotism, 

The family walk out of the embassy.  Bart passes a sign saying "Now
Entering Australia."

  Bart: Hey, G.I.Joe: your sign's broken.  We're already in Australia.
Marine: Actually, Sir, the embassy is considered American soil, Sir!
 Homer: Really?  Look, boy, now I'm in Australia...[hops over the line]
        Now I'm in America...Australia!  America!
  Bart: I get it, Dad.
 Homer: Australia!  America!
 Marge: Homer, that's enough!
 Homer: Australia!  America!  [gets punched] Ow!
Marine: Here in America we don't tolerate that kind of crap, Sir!
-- Laying down the law, 

At the Cultural Centre, Marge reads the plaque at the base of a statue
of a man who looks like Snake.

Marge: "Australia was originally founded as a settlement for British
       convicts"!  Oh, Lisa, watch your camera.
        [Lisa turns around to see a group of people reaching for it;
       they back off sheepishly and turn to another tourist]
-- Criminals, the lot of them, 

The family decide to eat a little at a local pub.

           [Bart flicks a pocket knife open and closed repeatedly]
      Man: You call that a knife?  _This_ is a knife.
     Bart: That's not a knife, that's a spoon.
      Man: All right, all right, you win, heh.  I see you've played
           Knifey-Spooney before.
    Homer: [to bartender] Hey!  Give me one of those famous giant beers
           I've heard so much about.
            [bartender puts a huge beer in front of him]
Bartender: Something wrong, yank?
    Homer: No.  It's pretty big...I guess.
    Marge: I'll just have a cup of coffee.
Bartender: Beer, it is.
    Marge: No, I said "coffee".
Bartender: "Beer"?
    Marge: [slowly] Coff-ee.
Bartender: Be-er?
    Marge: C -- O --
Bartender: B -- E --
-- Selective hearing, 

Conover stands with the family on the front steps of the parliament
house.

Marge: We'll meet you boys back here for dinner.  Good luck, honey.
       [kisses Bart]
 Lisa: Bart, I'm sorry I'm going to miss your public humiliation, but
       the Wolumbaloo Dirt Monument is just too exciting to pass up!
-- Bart prepares to apologize, 

They walk off.  Inside the building, Tobias and his father step up to
greet Homer and Bart.  A man bangs a gavel.

 Andy: Hear ye, hear ye.  This session will now come to order.  With the
       cooperation of the US Department of State, we have present today
       one Bart Simpson.
        [everyone mutters amongst themselves]
       I believe he has something to say.  Bart?
 Bart: [goes to microphone, scratches, clears throat several times]
       I'm sorry.  I'm sorry for what I did to your country.
        [everyone applauds]
 Andy: [jovial] Well, you're free to go, Bart...right after your
       additional punishment.
Homer: Punishment?
 Andy: Well, a mere apology would be a bit empty, eh?  Let the booting
       begin.
Homer: Booting?
 Andy: Aw, it's just a little kick in the bum.
        [a man with a gigantic boot walks in]
 Bart: Y'uh oh.
-- Little meaning big, that is, 

{The act ends two seconds sooner.}

[End of Act Two.  Time: 14:19]

The man with the large boot walks menacingly up to Bart.

  Homer: What kind of a sick country would kick someone with a giant
         boot?
Conover: Mr. Simpson, shush!  Disparaging the boot is a bootable
         offense.  It's one of their proudest traditions.
          [Australian flag shows a union jack, the boot, and a butt]
          [Bart is bent over by the Andy; the boot man winds up]
  Homer: You sold us out, Conover!  [breaks free]
          [pulls boot off boot man, threatens others with it]
          [puts boot on, grabs Andy]
         Stand back, or I'll boot your Prime Minister!  I'll do it, so
         help me God I'll boot him!
         When will you Australians learn?  In America we _stopped_ using
         corporal punishment, and things have never been better!  The
         streets are safe.  Old people strut confidently through the
         darkest alleys.  And the weak and nerdy are admired for their
         computer-programming abilities.  So, like us, let your children
         run wild and free, because, as the old saying goes, "Let your
         children run wild and free."
-- Homer mounts the soapbox, 

"Now, boy!  Run back to the embassy, back to American soil" yells Homer,
smashing the window with the boot and running out.

Man 1: I'll stop them!
        [throws a boomerang which skims Bart's hair]
       Oh, no!  It's coming back this way!
Man 2: That throwing stick stunt of yours has boomeranged on us.
 Bart: [spying a kangaroo] Hey!  We can get away in their pouches.
        [tries to climb in]
       Ew!  It's not like in cartoons.
Homer: Yeah, there's a lot more mucus.
-- Mmm, pouch mucus, 

Meanwhile, in a souvenir store...

 Lisa: Mom, you said I could have one souvenir, right?  Well I want the
       didgeridoo.  [plays it]
Marge: Mmm, that seems very noisy and expensive for a souvenir.  Mmm,
       why don't you get this nice cap?  ["Pobody's Nerfect in
       Australia"] It's clever...just like you.  Hmm?  Hmm?
Owner: [sweeping a bunch of toads out] Get out, get out!  Shoo, shoo.
       Get out of here, yuck!  These bloody things are everywhere.
       They're in the lift, in the lorry, in the bond wizard, and all
       over the malonga gilderchuck.
Clerk: They're like kangaroos, but they're reptiles, they is.
Marge: We have them in America.  They're called bullfrogs.
Clerk: What?  That's an odd name.  I'd have called them "chazzwazzers".
-- Ah, the wacky Australian faunae, 

Bart and Homer run past the store at high speed; Lisa and Marge join
them in their frantic race back to the embassy, a whole hoard of police
and angry citizens in their wake.  Ward sees them approaching.  "Oh, the
Simpsons.  Well, they're not getting back in here."  He pushes a button
to close the embassy gate, but it stops working when the gate is closed
half way.  The Simpsons run in anyway as two marines close the gate the
rest of the way by hand.

In the bedroom again, Marge is incensed.

  Marge: I can't believe our government would set up Bart like that!
         I'm must say, I'm very angry at the State Department right now.
   Ward: Yes, but Mrs. Simpson, please: we're about to reach a
         breakthrough with the Aussies.
Conover: [on the phone] Then it's agreed: during the bargaining session,
         we each get two candy apples...all right, one candy and one
         caramel.
  Marge: Oh, for the love of criminy!  Gimme that.  [grabs phone]
         Look, I know Bart did something wrong, but he's my son, and
         _I'm_ going to punish him myself.  Our countries may have their
         differences, but as human beings, I think we can all agree,
         there's no substitute for the discipline of a loving parent...
         [listens] He wants to talk to you.
Conover: Y'ello?  Mm hmm...so we're in agreement.  She won't be allowed
         near the phone again.
  Marge: Mmm...
-- 

Later on, Conover and Ward walk back in.

    Ward: We _did_ it!  We've worked out a compromise that will allow
          both nations to save face.
 Conover: We've argued them down to...a booting.
Everyone: What?!
    Ward: The Prime Minister just wants to kick you once, through the
          gate, with a regular shoe.
 Conover: I believe it's a wingtip.
   Marge: No deal!  This is my son we're talking about.  Sure, he's not
          perfect, but who is in this workaday world?
    Bart: Mom, wait!
           [he goes to look at the toilet swirling machine]
          It's time for me to bend over and receive my destiny.
-- Bart, stoic in valor, 

Bart walks over to the gate as the assembled crowd mutters.

 Lisa: [weepy] Thank you, Bart.  I promise I won't make fun of you later
       for this.
Homer: [sniffs] Show 'em what American butts are made of, Son.
        [the Prime Minister shines his shoe]
        [Bart bends over in front of him, on the other side of the gate]
 Andy: That's it, lad: this is for the Commonwealth of Australia.
        [winds up; Bart moves out of the way just in time]
 Bart: And _this_ is for the United States of America!
        [moons them: "Don't tread on me" is written on his butt]
        [hums "The Star Spangled Banner" while waving it at them]
-- Patriotic until the last, 

The crowd, frenzied, breaks down the metal gate and charges Bart.
Everyone runs inside the embassy just in time.  A helicopter swoops down
to the roof to rush the family away.

Marge: I'm glad you're OK, honey, but I wish you'd chosen a more
       tasteful way to be patriotic.
 Lisa: I'm impressed you were able to write so legibly on your own butt.
-- In the aftermath of the mooning, 

Two marines take down the US flag, fold it, and eat it (presumably to
prevent it from being desecration).  The family get in the helicopter
just in time as the Prime Minister calls, "All right, mates, let 'em
have it!"  The assembled crowd toss their cans of Fosters' at the
helicopter.

Homer: Hey, do we get to land on an aircraft carrier?
Pilot: No, Sir, the closest vessel in the USS Walter Mondale.  It's a
       laundry ship.  They'll take you the rest of the way.
        [shot shows frogs destroying all the crops]
Homer: Hey, look!  Those frogs are eating all their crops.
        [everyone starts laughing]
 Lisa: Well, that's what happens when you introduce foreign species into
       an ecosystem that can't handle them.
        [everyone laughs more]
        [a lone koala holds onto the helicopter with determination]
-- Imminent koala infestation of the US predicted, 

[End of Act Three.  Time: 20:38]

The music over the credits has a didgeridoo playing underneath a
background of flutes, drums, violins, and guitars.  A didgeridoo plays
instead of the regular music over the Gracie Films logo, too.
 EPISODE TITLE: Homer vs. Patty and Selma


EPISODE SUMMARY: 
[Syndication cuts are marked in curly braces "{}" and are courtesy of
Ricardo Lafaurie and Frederic Briere.]

At Moe's Tavern, Lenny, Carl, Barney, and a couple of other regulars all
puff on cigars being handed out by Homer.

   Moe: [sniffing a cigar] Ah, this place is going to smell classy all
        week.
Barney: To Homer, the Wall Street genius!
         [everyone claps as Homer bows]
         [Homer lights a cigar with a $1, then puts out the flame and
        puts it back in his wallet]
 Lenny: Hey, Homer!  How come you've got money to burn?  Or singe,
        anyway?
  Carl: Yeah, Homer, what's your secret investment?
 Homer: Take a guess.
Barney: Uh, pumpkins?
 Homer: [pause] Yeah, that's right, Barney.  This year, I invested in
        pumpkins.  They've been going up the whole month of October and
        I got a feeling they're going to peak right around January.
        Then, bang!  That's when I'll cash in.
Barney: To Homer, and to Sergeant Pepper, who's growing out of the
        middle of your back.
   Moe: Uh, Barn, you gotta unwrap the plastic before you smoke those.
-- Moe, carcinogen expert, 

Everyone toasts Homer as the camera pans to a jack-o'-lantern.  Not long
after, the pumpkin is a rotted pile.

Broker: Homer, you knuckle-beak, I told you a hundred times: you've got
        to sell your pumpkin futures before Hallowe'en!  Before!
 Homer: All right, let's not panic: I'll make the money back by selling
        one of my livers.  I can get by with one.
-- Homer confuses internal organs, 

On the way home, Homer contemplates his predicament.

      Homer: Oh, how am I going to tell Marge we're broke?  I need a
             miracle...
              [sees smoke leaking from under the front door]
              [gasps] My house is on fire.  Woo hoo!  Insurance to the
             rescue.
              [walks in, sees Patty and Selma smoking]
Patty+Selma: Hello, Homer.
      Homer: Marge, we had a deal: your sisters don't come here after
             6:00 and I stop eating your lipstick.
              [wipes some furtively off his teeth]
      Marge: This is a special occasion.  Patty and Selma just got
             promoted at the DMV!
      Selma: Yeah, Homer: let your wife have a glimpse of success for
             once.
      Homer: All right, that's the last straw: time to take out the
             trash!  But first, I'm going to have to ask you to leave.
-- Homer's veiled threats, 

The sisters cling to the couch even more tightly.  Homer pushes it out
the door and dumps them onto the lawn, then pulls the couch back inside.
Marge is apologetic.

Marge: I'm sorry: Homer doesn't mean to be rude, he's just a very
       complicated man.
        [Homer appears at the bedroom window, breaks a plate over his
       head]
Homer: Wrong!
Selma: When are you going to wake up and smell your husband, Marge?
Patty: Granted, you got some kids out of him, but when the seed have
       been planted, you throw away the envelope.
Marge: I wish you wouldn't put Homer down like that.  He may not be a
       big success like you, but I can always count on him to provide
       for the family.
Homer: [overhearing] Oh, sweet, trusting Marge, I can't let you down.
       [holds up overdue mortgage notice] I'll get some money somehow.
        [dials phone 5774623] Hello, Vegas?  Give me 100 bucks on red...
       D'oh!  All right, I'll send you a check.
-- The Vegas Gamb-L-Phone, 

Homer sits in bed with a pad of paper and a pen.

Homer: If only I could think of an invention...something that would
       really make money.  Must concentrate and work harder than I've
       ever worked -- [falls asleep]
        [in his dream, a conference table of executives applaud]
  Man: Congratulations, Mr. Simpson.  This invention of yours has made
       us all rich, especially you.  It's simply yet ingenious, and it
       fits right in the palm of your hand.  Every person in America now
       owns one of these, and in many cases, three or four.
Homer: [reaching for the man's palm] Uh, could I just get a look at
       that?
  Man: Ha ha!  Why would you need to see it?  You're the genius that
       invented the product in question.
Homer: But, uh, could I just --
  Man: Now don't worry, you'll get to see it just as soon as we unveil
       our new ad campaign.
        [a screen projects a hand closed around something]
        [everyone stands up and blocks Homer's view]
Homer: Lemme see, lemme see!  Out of the way!
-- Not even in his dreams, 

       [Marge appears in the dream, then awakens Homer]
Marge: Homer!  Homer, wake up!  There's still a few minutes till our
       usual bedtime.
Homer: Oh, my invention!  All our money problems could have been --
Marge: Money problems?  Homer, are we in some sort of fiduciary trouble?
        [Homer imagines Marge dressed like a queen]
Homer: Oh, Marge, my loyal wife, of course not.
        [Lisa walks up; Homer imagines her differently]
       And Lisa, my little princess.
        [Bart walks up]
       And who could forget dear Ratboy?
 Bart: Ratboy?  I resent that.  [gnaws on doorframe]
Marge: Bart, I told you before, stop gnawing on the drywall.
-- Bart's teeth-dulling tactics, 

The next day, Bart and Milhouse walk to school.

    Bart: What a day, eh, Milhouse?  The sun is out, birds are singing,
          bees are trying to have sex with them -- as is my
          understanding --
Milhouse: It is a gorgeously fabulous day -- marvelous, even.
    Bart: So, uh...what's your hurry to get to school?  [slows down]
Milhouse: [coy] Nothing...what's _your_ hurry?  [slows down more]
           [Bart stops walking]
          That's enough, Bart.  Fun is fun, but if we're late we're
          going to get in trouble.
    Bart: You're right, Milhouse: fun _is_ fun.  [whistles]
-- Bart, nonchalant idler, 

At school, Principal Skinner, the principal, makes an announcement from
the Principal's Office.

Skinner: [over PA] Attention, students.  It's time once again to choose
         a gym class for the coming term so let's all prove how adult we
         can be by filing to the gym in a calm and orderly manner...even
         though it's first come, first serve, and the most popular
         sports fill up fast.
          [a mass hysteria takes over as everyone rushes to the gym]
  Willy: [getting trampled] Aah!  Too many wee ones.
Richard: This gets uglier every year!  Any sign of Bart and Milhouse?
  Lewis: No...and if they don't get here soon, it'll be T.S. for them.
  Ralph: [at "tethered swimming"] I don't feel right.
-- I don't think he means Eliot, 

The school bell rings throughout the clear neighborhood air.

Milhouse: Do you hear that, Bart?  That was the tardy bell.  Truant!
          Truant!  Truant, they'll all say!  [runs off screaming]
    Bart: Aw, who needs him?  I can have fun all by myself.
           [makes a puppet with his hand]
    Bart: [high voice] S'all right?
  Puppet: [low voice] S'all right.
    Bart: S'all right?
  Puppet: S'all right.
    Bart: S'all right?
  Puppet: S'all right.
           [Bart laughs to himself]
-- New Bedlam, here he comes, 

At Moe's, Homer begs for a loan.

  Moe: Sure, Homer, I can loan you all the money you need.  However,
       since you have no collateral, I'm going to have to break your
       legs in advance.
Homer: Gosh, Moe, I use these all the time.  Couldn't you just bash my
       head in?
  Moe: Hey, hey: are you a loan shark?  Do you understand how finance
       works?  [grabs a sledgehammer] Now let's do this thing.
-- Moe, the real Wall Street genius, 

In the gym, almost everyone has signed up for a sport.  Bart looks
around and sees how late he is.

    Bart: Oh, no, it's PE signup day!
    Lisa: How could you forget?  They had signs posted all over the
          library.
Milhouse: Better sign up for something fast, man.  Baseball just filled
          up -- oof!  [gets kicked]
  Nelson: So did Tae Kwon Do.
-- Thanks for the demo, 

Bart runs first to the lap running booth, but it's full.  Same deal with
the pushup course.  Even "gender issues in sport" is full.  Skinner puts
a hand on Bart's shoulder.

Skinner: Heh heh, there's only one class left, but it happens to be the
         coolest one of all.
   Bart: Ballet?  Dancing is for girls.
Skinner: Well, you should have gotten here earlier.
-- Sweet Seymour Skinner's Badass Revenge, 

Homer begs at the First Bank of Springfield.

  Homer: Er, I need another extension on my mortgage payments.
Manager: I understand that Mr. Simpson, but according to our computer,
         your credit history is not good.  It says here that you've been
         predeclined for every major credit card.  It also says that you
         once grabbed a dog by the hind legs and pushed him around like
         a vacuum cleaner.
  Homer: That was in the third grade!
Manager: Yeah, well, it all goes on your permanent record.  I'm sorry,
         but if you don't come up with that money by tomorrow, the bank
         is going to take your house.
  Homer: Well, good luck finding it, because I'm going to take the
         numbers off tonight!
Manager: Well, we'll look for the house with no numbers.
  Homer: Then I'll take off the numbers on my neighbor's house.
Manager: So, well then we'll look for the house _next_ to the house with
         no numbers.
  Homer: [thinks for a bit] All right, you'll get your money.
-- Homer loses the loan extension tete-a-tete, "Homer vs. Patty and
    Selma"

Homer resorts to his final option.

Homer: You're my last, last chance: bottom-of-the-barrel, hail-mary,
       long-shot, wish-you-would-do-it-but-probably-won't final resort
       to lend me money.
Selma: We'll take care of you.
Patty: Yes, care.
        [they laugh evilly]
        [Homer starts laughing too; he continues long after they stop]
Patty: Cut him a check and get him the hell out of here!
-- Patty's patience limit, 

[End of Act One.  Time: 7:23]

Homer sits at the table with his family.

Homer: What a wonderful dinner.  What a beautiful family!  Someone get a
       picture of me with my arm around this steak.
 Lisa: You're certainly in a good mood tonight, Dad.
Homer: Well, Lisa, I managed to solve a little problem today, and to
       celebrate, I'm going to tilt my chair.
        [does so] Mmm, slanty.
        [a grumbling is heard]
Marge: Patty!  Selma!  What are you doing here?
Patty: We thought we'd stop by unexpectedly for dinner.
Selma: Now bring us some extra chairs like a good blubber-in-law.
Homer: Time to fertilize the lawn; a couple of 500 pound bags should do
       it!  [grabs them by the neck]
Marge: Homer!  Be careful of my sisters' heads: their necks are brittle.
Patty: That's OK, Marge: nothing's broke...except Homer.
Homer: [gasps]
Marge: What's that supposed to mean?
Patty: It means --
Homer: [stuffing their heads against his armpits] It means these two
       fabulous babes are staying for dinner.
Selma: [gasping] Now there's a stink I could have done without.
-- Homer's secret shame almost slips out, 

Afterwards, Homer smiles falsely as Patty and Selma eye him from the
other couch.

Marge: This has been such a nice peaceful dinner.  It calls for a
       celebration.  I'm going to make the most international coffee in
       the house: Montreal Morn.  [leaves]
Homer: All right, you had your fun, now get lost.
Patty: Oh ho, our fun hasn't begin yet.
Homer: Huh?
        [Selma holds out mortgage IOU paper]
Selma: We know something you don't want Marge to know.  Now, we own you
       like Siegfried owns Roy.
Marge: I'm sorry, all we have is Nescafe.  I'm very, very sorry.
Patty: Oh Marge, Marge: you're just in time.  Homer's getting ready to
       give us a foot rub.
Marge: You are?
Homer: No!  I -- uh...I'm giving them a foot massage.  At least let me
       have that.
Patty: [holding leg out] You can start with the corns.
Selma: [holding leg out] Then you can move on to bunion country.
-- It's a big country, 

Bart approaches the ballet room with trepidation.

   Bart: OK...steady, Bart.  Taking ballet doesn't make you any less of
         a man.
          [opens the door; all the little girls point and laugh]
Teacher: All right, girls, today we learn the dance of the Faerie
         Queens.  You can either be a faerie, or a queen.  It's wide
         open.
   Bart: [groans]
Teacher: Ah!  And what have we here?  A young man maybe who thinks he
         can be the next Baryshnikov?
   Bart: [surly] I don't want to be the next _anything_.  I'm only
         taking this stupid class because they made me.
Teacher: So, he has fire in the belly!  But it will take more than
         bellyfire to be the next Baryshnikov.
   Bart: Look, Boris, I think ballet's for sissies.
Teacher: Ha ha ha!  Ballet is for the strong, the fierce, the
         determined, but for the sissies, never!  Now, put on this
         fuchiatard: you are a faerie.
-- In the most masculine sense of the word, that is, "Homer vs. Patty
    and Selma"

At the power plant, Lenny and Carl approach Homer.

Lenny: Quitting time!
 Carl: Let's go, Homer.  On the way home, we're stopping at Moe's for a
       Zima.
Homer: Er, maybe I'll just stay and work overtime.  My sisters-in-law
       are at my house again.
 Carl: Homer, quit wallowing in self-pity.  Pull yourself together and
       come get drunk with us.
-- On Zima?  Surely you jest, 

Back in ballet class, an old record plays some cheesy piano music.

Teacher: Is something wrong, Mr. Simpson?
   Bart: I don't like wearing tights, ma'am.
Teacher: But so many of your heroes wear tights: Batman, for example,
         and...Magellan.
   Bart: Look, I don't like this cootie platoon and I never well.  I'm
         out of here, and I'm out of this stupid outfit.
          [struggles to take it off; struggles turn graceful]
         Wait!  Joy of movement increasing.  Love of dance impossible to
         resist.
          [the other girls gasp with delight]
         Toes twinkling...look at me, girls!  I'm doing ballet...and I
         love it!
-- At least he's not wizzing with the door open, "Homer vs. Patty and
    Selma"

Patty and Selma have indeed parked their wide butts in front of Homer's
TV.

Patty: Hmm...am I wrong, or did it just get fatter in here?
Homer: Request permission to slink by.
Patty: Permission pending.  First...light our cigarettes.
Homer: But you're already smoking cig --
        [they stub them and take new ones, clearing their throats]
       You're really pushing it.
Selma: Come on, Homer: you can't spell "obsequious" without I-O-U.
Homer: I'll have to trust you on that.
Patty: Well, Marge was always a good speller...let's ask her.
Homer: No!  Don't tell Marge.  I'll be good, I'll be good!
        [lights their cigarettes, then tries to light the IOU]
Patty: Tut tut tut!  Just for that, you have to crawl around on the
       floor like the dog you are.
Homer: [stammers] Yes, ma'am.  [gets on all fours]
        [the twins laugh]
Patty: Now say, "I am Homer Simpson, the lowly dog" -- in a dog's voice.
Homer: I am Homer Simpson...
Patty: Good, good.  Jump, Homer, jump!
-- No end to the humiliation, 

Marge: [walking in] What's going on in here?
Homer: [in a dog's voice still] Absolutely nothing, Marge!
Marge: What's that paper?
Homer: What paper?  [reaches for it]
        [it floats up and lands on top of the light]
Marge: [gasps] Homer!  Is this projection accurate?  Did you borrow
       money from my sisters?
Homer: I don't know, Marge, I can't be expected to keep track of all my
       wheelings and dealings.
Patty: He blew all your savings on jack-o'-lanterns.
Homer: [gasps] You told!
        [tosses Patty out]
        [tosses Marge out accidentally, runs out to get her]
       Sorry, Marge.
        [tosses Selma out]
       I never want to see you again!  You either.
Marge: Homer...Homer, why didn't you tell me?
Homer: [ashen] I was ashamed, Marge.  I've failed you as a husband and a
       provider...and at best, I was a B+ dog.  I'll understand if you
       want to sleep on the couch tonight.  [goes to bedroom]
-- The truth comes out, 

[End of Act Two.  Time: 12:38]

Everyone but Homer eats breakfast.

 Lisa: How's Dad today?
Marge: Not too good, Lisa.  Frankly, he's underneath the table.
Homer: Nobody make me any breakfast.  A man so deeply in debt doesn't
       deserve it.
Marge: But I like to make you breakfast!
Homer: Oh, in that case I'll just have French toast with double butter
       and a side of bacon...but no powdered sugar, I don't deserve it.
       Well, maybe a little powdered sugar.
-- The powdered sugar scale of shame, 

In ballet class, Bart strains to a new piece.

   Bart: See that?  I started to do, like, a little arabesque, but then
         I just fully went for it and pulled off the demi-entrechat.
         Not that I'm into that kind of thing -- [drinks a Tab]
Teacher: Bravissimo, Bart!  Next week, class gives its first recital,
         and you, you will dance the male lead!
   Bart: Dance in front of the whole school?  What is it with you and
         ballet?
Teacher: I have know you have great conflict, Bart: you love ballet, yet
         you fear the boys will laugh at you, no?
   Bart: No, I fear the girls will laugh at me.  I fear the boys will
         beat the living snot out of me.
-- As opposed to the dead snot, 

Lisa walks up to Homer who sits on the couch.

     Lisa: Hey, Dad.  Whatcha doin'?
    Homer: Daddy has very important work to do.  He's looking through
           the want ads to find a part-time job.
     Lisa: Dad, that's a gag paper we got at the carnival.
    Homer: Oh.  No wonder I didn't hear about Bart being elected world's
           greatest sex machine.  Oh, I'll never pay off that debt!
            [on TV]
Announcer: Need money fast?  Got no experience?  Step up...to elegance!
           Become a limo driver at Classy Joe's.
    Homer: That's it!  I'll make money with a chauffeur job.  Good thing
           you turned on that TV, Lisa.
     Lisa: I didn't turn it on, I thought _you_ turned it on.
    Homer: No.  Well, anyway, turn it off.
     Lisa: It _is_ off.
-- Enter "Twilight Zone" theme, 

It's the day of the ballet performance.

Skinner: You're going to have to work hard to win this crowd over.  Most
         of them are here as part of detention.
   Bart: Pretty big crowd.
Skinner: Mm hmm.  We've even bussed in troublemakers from other schools.
   Bart: [gulps apprehensively]
-- Detention punishments worse than death, 

As the music starts, a girl does performs solo on stage.  Bart soon
joins her from the wings, a mask concealing his features.

  Lisa: That spiky-haired masked dancer is really something.  I wonder
        who he is?
 Jimbo: He's graceful, yet masculine.  So it's OK for me to enjoy this.
Nelson: {[philosophically] This reminds me of the movie "Fame", and to a
        lesser extent, the TV series, which was also called "Fame".}
-- Bart wows his fellow students, 

Homer, true to his word, drives a limo for Classy Joe.

 Homer: Oh, wow!  I can't believe my very first passenger is comedy
        legend Mel Brooks!  I _love_ that movie "Young Frankenstein"...
        scared the hell out of me.
Brooks: Um...thanks.
 Homer: Hey!  Let's do that 2000-pound man thing.  I'll be that Carl
        Reiner guy, and you be what's-his-face.
Brooks: [chuckles] Homer, it's not that easy.  It takes the genius of
        Carl Reiner and the rhythm and timing that only he and I --
 Homer: [as Reiner] Sir, today every country has a national anthem.  Did
        they have national anthems 2000 years ago?
Brooks: [Yiddish voice] Sure.  Sure, we had.  Of course, we was caves...
        but every cave had a national anthem.  I'll never forget that my
        cave's national anthem was --
 Homer: What was that...national anthem?
Brooks: [singing] Let 'em all go to hell/except Cave 76 --
-- It's happening again!, 

A police siren blares.

Brooks: [Yiddish voice] What's with the sir -- [normal voice] What's
        with the siren?
Wiggum: Evening, Simpson.  You got a short and your taillight started
        blinking when you made that turn.  Let's see your chauffer's
        license.
 Homer: Chauffeur's license, eh?  Mel, buckle your borscht belt!
         [floors it]
Wiggum: Um, since you're trying to make a getaway in "park", I'm
        guessing you _don't_ have a license.  Better head down to the
        DMV; these two broads will help you out.  [shows a photo]
 Homer: Aah!  Aah!  Aah!  Aah!
Brooks: Wow.  Er, officer, this man is making me a little edgy.  Could
        you please give me a ride to the airport?
Wiggum: Well hey, hey!  You're Mel Brooks.  Sure, I'll give you a ride.
Brooks: Thank you.
Wiggum: Er, on the way, we can do that, uh, 2000-dollar man thing.
Brooks: Mmm...
Wiggum: You be Carl Reiner, and I'll be police chief Wiggum.
Brooks: Listen, why don't _you_ play Carl Reiner, and let _me_ play
        police chief Wiggum?  I hate Carl Reiner!
-- Not as much as Carl Sagan, though, 

The ballet performance goes smashingly.

  Jimbo: {[weeping] I haven't been moved like this since "The Joy Luck
         Club".}
          [Bart does a final leap; everyone oohs]
   Bart: [thinking] They love me; I'm accepted.  I don't need this mask
         any more.  [out loud] Behold, the masked dancer is me, Bart!
          [removes mask; everyone gasps]
         It is I who have won your acclaim.
  Jimbo: Bart does ballet!
Kearney: He dances like girls!
 Nelson: Ha ha!
   Bart: Go ahead and laugh.  But I took a chance and did something I
         wanted to do.  And if that makes me a sissy, well, then...I
         guess I'm a sissy.
  Jimbo: [pause] He's a sissy!  Let's rush him.
-- So much for openness, 

Rush him, they do.  Bart barely manages to escape.  They chase him over
a field; Bart's forward progress is stopped at a chasm.  Nervously, he
sees his would-be tormentors approaching, and thinks back to his
teacher: "Bart, use the ballet!  Leap!  Leap, like you've never leapt
before!"  He does so -- only to fall into the middle of the chasm,
injuring himself badly.

 Jimbo: Looks like he took a pretty bad spill.
Nelson: [pokes him with a stick] Well, as long as he's hurt...
         [they walk away]
  Lisa: {Bart, I am so proud of you.  You've showed a sensitive side of
        yourself that can never be erased.  From this day forward, we
        are kindred spirits.  [kisses him, walks off]}
  Bart: {Why'd she just leave me here when I clearly need medical
        attention?}
-- Ah, the mysteries of life, 

Homer, meanwhile, is in somewhat serious trouble.

Homer: Stupid driving test at the stupid DMV where stupid Patty and
       stupid Selma work!  Sometimes I think God is teasing me...just
       like he teased Moses in the desert.
Marge: Tested, Homer!  God tested Moses.  And try to be nice to my
       sisters.  It's very hard on me to have you fighting all the time.
Homer: Oh, OK Marge, I'll get along with them.  Then, I will hug some
       snakes...yes!  Then, I will hug and kiss some poisonous snakes.
       Now _that's_ sarcasm.
-- Homer masters a new art form, 

Patty and Selma relish their position in the back seat of Homer's limo.

Patty: Well, well, well: look who needs us again to get his chauffeur's
       license.
Homer: Look, all I ask is that you be fair.
Patty: Oh!  Did not adjust side mirror.  Minus one point.
Selma: Failed to check blind spot.  Minus two points.
Homer: You won't be happy until my family thinks I'm a loser, will you?
Patty: You _are_ a loser, Homer...and we're winners.  You gotta learn
       that.
Selma: Ooh, seat belt twisted.  Minus one point.
Homer: Nagging the driver.  Minus ten points for you!
Patty: Grazed a cone.  Minus _five_ points!
Homer: Being a jerk.  Minus a million points!
-- Did not!  Did too!, 

The twins mark his written test.

Homer: D'oh!
Patty: One more wrong answer, and Homer flunks another of life's little
       tests.  And what's this?
Selma: Ooh...someone didn't fill in a circle all the way!
Homer: Oh!
        [Patty stamps "FAIL" on it]
Patty: Oho.  Oh boy.  Oh, that felt good.
Selma: Let me try, let me try.  [grunts] Oh, yeah.  Oh boy.  Oh that was
       so sweet.
        [they light up cigarettes]
-- Vicarious pleasure, 

Marge: [walking up] So, Homer, how'd you do?
Homer: [glum] Well, I...
Super: Ladies, please don't tell me you're smoking in a government
       building.  Because that is _precisely_ the kind of infraction
       that can cost a couple of sisters their promotion.
        [they gasp, and stammer]
Homer: [chuckles to himself] [sees Marge looking unhappy]
        [sighs] I'll never forgive myself for this.
        [grabs both cigarettes, drags]
Super: Wait a minute!  Those are yours, sir?
Homer: [monotone] Yes.  [coughs] I am in flavor country.
Super: [skeptical] _Both_ of them?
Homer: [hacks] It's a big country.
Super: Ladies, I apologize.  And you, sir, are worse than Hitler.
        [she slaps him]
-- Homer's going to invade Poland next, 

Patty: Homer, um...I'm speechless.  You just saved our hides.
Homer: Please, on top of everything else, don't make me picture your
       hides!
Marge: That's a wonderful thing you did for my sisters.
Homer: I didn't do it for them...I did it for _you_, Marge.  I'd kill
       for you.  Please ask me to kill for you --
Marge: No, Homey.  You see?  You see, this is the stuff I've been
       telling you about that you never see!
Patty: Homer...we're...sorry.
Selma: If there's anything we can do to make it up --
Homer: Call off the debt?
Patty: Or, say, we could let you pass your driver's test --
Homer: Call off the debt?
Patty: Uh...well --
Homer: Debt's off!  Let's go, Marge.
        [squeals away in his car]
-- Exeunt Homer and Marge, 

[End of Act Three.  Time: 20:56]
 EPISODE TITLE: A Star is Burns


EPISODE SUMMARY: 
[Syndication cuts are marked in curly braces "{}" and are courtesy of
Frederic Briere.]

"Hello.  I'm Kent Brockman, and this is `Eye On Springfield'."  The
opening montage for "Eye On Springfield" depicting Kent Brockman in
various places around town and women in bikinis runs, featuring a new
silly shot of Krusty directing zoo animals into one entrance of a Krusty
Burger and people walking out the exit on the other side of the
building.

 Kent: [on TV] Tonight, we'll visit Springfield's answer to the
       Benidictine monks: the Rappin' Rabbis.
Rabbi: Don't eat pork, not even with a fork.
        [motions to cooked pig] Can't touch this!
Homer: Marge, are we Jewish?
Marge: No, Homer.
Homer: Woo hoo!
        [grabs a cooked pig, starts carving at it]
-- Religious questioning, 

   Kent: But first, we all stink!
    Man: "We all"...hey!
   Kent: That's according to a national survey ranking Springfield as
         the least popular city in America.
          [cut to Skinner tied to a stake on top of a pyre]
         In science, dead last.
Skinner: I'm telling you people, the earth revolves around the sun!
    Abe: Burn him!  [lights the pyre]
Shutton: What a story!  [takes a photo]
    Abe: [chasing him] You've stolen my soul!
          [cut to Krusty playing FDR in a play]
   Kent: [voiceover] In culture, dead last.
 Krusty: Eleanor, we've got to do something about this depression.
         [starts walking toward her] So I propose -- oh, that's right!
         I'm crippled, heh.
-- Not exactly Oscar material, 

  Lisa: This is terrible!  People will start to avoid Springfield.
 Homer: But what can I do?  I'm just...[counts "One" on fingers] one
        man.
 Marge: I think we should call a town meeting.  If we don't do something
        soon, we won't get any tourists at all.
  Bart: {No tourists?!  I'll be ruined!
         [cut to Bart outside next to a sign waving a pamphlet]
        Maps to movie stars' homes!
         [repeats same thing in Spanish]
         [repeats same thing in some Oriental language]
         [some Japanese tourists take one]
         [cut to scene with them knocking on a door; Moe, in his
        underwear, answers it]}
Father: {Excuse me, are you Drew Barrymore?}
   Moe: {What?  Get out of here, I'm hung over!}
Mother: {Sorry, Miss Barrymore.}
   Moe: {What?}
-- The plight of Springfield's tourists, 

At the town hall, Diamond Joe bangs a gavel.

  Quimby: Are there any suggestions for how to attract more tourism?
           [Patty and Selma raise their hands]
           [they stand next to a blackboard with "Springfield" on it]
   Patty: The easiest way to be popular is to leech off the popularity
          of others.
   Selma: So we propose changing our name from "Springfield" to
          "Seinfeld".  [does so on the blackboard]
           [a bass synth riff a la "Seinfeld" plays]
    Bart: {I may be just a boy, but I have an idea.  If I may, I'd like
          to show you a few slides.
           [a slide shows a closeup of someone's butt]
          Here's Springfield as it appears from space.  Somewhere in
          this windy valley is the Lost Dutchman's Mine.}
  Quimby: {Young man, that appears to be a picture of your rear end.}
    Bart: {So long, suckers!
           [pulls screen cord, gets yanked up with it and wrapped inside
          it]
          Aw, this is the last time I use an escape plan devised by
          Milhouse.}
Milhouse: {[wrapped inside other end] Uh, sorry Bart.}
-- A town meeting is called, 

Marge stands up.

   Marge: I'm Marge Simpson, and I have an idea.
Everyone: Aw, no.  Marge is going to say something. etc.
   Marge: Now, I know you haven't liked some of my past suggestions,
          like switching to the metric system --
     Abe: [stammers a little] The metric system is the tool of the
          devil!  My car gets forty rods to the hogshead and that's the
          way I likes it.
  Quimby: The old person's remarks will be stricken from the record.
     Abe: Who said that?
   Marge: But my new idea's different.  I think we should hold a film
          festival and give out prizes.
  Wiggum: Can we make our own movies and enter them?
   Marge: Yes.
  Wiggum: At last, an excuse to wear makeup!
  Quimby: All in favor of Marge Simpson's film festival idea?
Everyone: Film festival!  Film festival!
   Marge: You like my idea?  Actually, I have several others --
Everyone: Don't push your luck!  Don't push your luck!
   Marge: Mmm...
-- At last, acceptance by Springfield as a whole!, 

Later, at home, Bart has his hair combed and wears a tuxedo.  Lisa films
him.

 Lisa: And...action!
 Bart: Hello, I'm Bart Simpson.  In the past, I've bought you such
       classic films as "Homer in the Shower" and "Homer on the Toilet".
       And now, I give you "The Eternal Struggle".  [opens a door]
Homer: [struggling with his pants] "Relaxed fit", my Aunt Fanny!  Stupid
       Dockers.  [grunts] Oh!  The belt is buckled.  Heh heh...
       [struggles some more]
-- Bart's film festival entry, 

Down by a river, Ned and Rod stand behind a camera aimed at Maude and
Todd (wrapped in swaddling clothes).

     Ned: Now, Maude, in our movie you lay Moses in the basket, then put
          it among the reeds, OK?  Lights, camera, ac-diddely-doddely-
          doodely-action Jackson!
           [Maude puts the basket in the water]
           [it gets swept quickly away]
    Todd: Help meeee...eeee...eeee...[the sound vanishes as Todd passes
          behind some trees]
     Ned: Flanders to God, Flanders to God, get off your cloud and save
          my Todd!
           [lightning fells a tree across the river, blocking Todd's
          path]
Everyone: Yay!
     Ned: Thanks, God!
     God: [making the OK sign through the clouds] Okily dokily!
-- The advantage of fundamentalism, 

Marge watches TV when Lisa walks in.

 Lisa: Whatcha doing, Mom?
Marge: I'm looking for a film critic to judge our festival.  Did you
       know there are over 600 critics on TV and Leonard Maltin is the
       best looking of them all?
 Lisa: Ew!
-- Lisa's dislike for beards shows through, 

On the TV...

    Jay: Welcome to "Coming Attractions".  I'm your host, Jay Sherman,
         thank you.  Tonight, we review an aging Charles Bronson in
         "Death Wish 9".
Bronson: [in a hospital bed] I wish I was dead.  Oy!
    Jay: But first, we have a special guest: Rainier Wolfcastle, star of
         the reprehensible McBain movies.
Rainier: Jay, my new film is a mixture of action und comedy.  It's
         called "McBain: Let's Get Silly".
          [cut to clip from movie showing McBain with a microphone in
         front of a brick wall]
 McBain: Did you ever notice how men always leave the toilet seat up?
         [pause] That's the joke.
    Man: [from audience] You suck, McBain!
          [McBain pulls a machine gun and fires into the audience]
 McBain: Now, my Woody Allen impression: I'm a neurotic nerd who likes
         to sleep with little girls.
    Man: [from audience] Hey, that really sucked!
          [McBain pulls the pin on a grenade and tosses it at him]
Rainier: The film is just me in front of a brick wall for an hour and a
         half.  It cost $80 million.
    Jay: [contemptuous] How do you sleep at night?
Rainier: On top of a pile of money with many beautiful ladies.
    Jay: Just asking.  Yeesh!
-- 

Lisa expresses her approval.

 Lisa: I like him!  He's smart, he's sensitive, he's clearly not
       obsessed with his physical appearance --
Homer: [walking by] My ears are burning.
 Lisa: Uh, I wasn't talking about you, Dad.
Homer: No, my ears are really burning.  I wanted to see inside so I lit
       a Q-Tip.
Marge: Mmm...
-- Homer, not a member of the Big Ear Family, 

Marge writes Jay Sherman a letter.

  Marge: [writing] "Dear Mr. Sherman, on behalf of the people of
         Springfield I would like to invite you to judge our film
         festival.
          [cut to Jay reading the letter in New York]
         You can stay with us, and enjoy the sights and sounds of the
         country.
  Homer: Marge, is this a pimple or a boil?
  Marge: Just a minute, Homer!  Oh, look what you made me write.
         Anyway, we think you'll really enjoy our quiet little town.
         Sincerely, Marge Simpson."
    Jay: Hmm.  Do I _really_ want to leave Manhattan?
Rainier: [walking up menacingly] Sherman, I just realized you insulted
         me!  Now you will die.  [pulls a machine gun]
    Jay: Uh, hey nudnick, your shoe's untied.
Rainier: From here, they appear to be tied, but I will go in for a
         closer look.
    Jay: Taxi!  [jumps into one] To the airport.
          [later that night]

[End of Act One.  Time: 7:00]

At the Springfield airport, a man announces, "Attention, the flight from
New York has arrived."  The plane cuts in front of another plane which
screeches to a halt as its pilot yells, "Hey, I'm landing here!"  Marge
and Homer watch the line of disembarking passengers file by.  Homer
holds a sign reading "Simpson".

"It's supposed to say Jay's name, not yours," explains Marge.  "Oh,
you're right," says Homer, erasing it and rewriting it.  "There you --
d'oh!" he curses, having written "Simpson" again.  "Just a second," he
says, repeating the procedure.  "Oh, that should -- d'oh!"  Jay walks up
anyway.

Marge: Hello, I'm Marge Simpson, and this is my husband, Homer.
  Jay: Oh, nice to meet you, Marge.  I saw your hair from the plane.
       And you must be the man who didn't know if he had a pimple or a
       boil.
Homer: It was a gummi bear.
-- An easy mistake to make, 

Bart watches TV at home.

Announcer: Coming up next, "The Flintstones" meet "The Jetsons".
     Bart: Uh oh.  I smell another cheap cartoon crossover.
    Homer: Bart Simpson, meet Jay Sherman, the critic.
      Jay: Hello.
     Bart: Hey, man.  I really love your show.  I think _all_ kids
           should watch it!  [turns away] Ew, I suddenly feel so dirty.
-- The metaphorical filth of "The Critic", 

Darth Vader's theme signals the scene change to Burns' office.

   Burns: I don't know what's happening.  It seems our profits have
          dropped 37%.
Smithers: I'm afraid we have a bad image, Sir.  Market research shows
          people see you as something of an ogre.
   Burns: I ought to club them and eat their bones!
Smithers: Heh heh, well, maybe this film festival could help us.  A film
          biography might let them get to know the real you: virtuous,
          heroic, nubile...
   Burns: [menacing] You left out pleasant!  [clubs Smithers with a
          newspaper] But I like that film biography idea: a slick
          Hollywood picture to gloss over my evil rise to power like
          "Bugsy" or "Working Girl".
-- Melanie Griffith: newly notorious?, 

     Burns: Get me Steven Spielberg!
  Smithers: He's unavailable.
     Burns: Then get me his non-union Mexican equivalent!
             [later] Listen, Senor Spielbergo, I want you to do for me
            what Spielberg did for Oskar Schindler.
Spielbergo: Er, Schindler es bueno, Senor Burns es el diablo.
     Burns: Listen, Spielbergo, Schindler and I are like peas in a pod:
            we're both factory owners, we both made shells for the
            Nazis, but mine worked, dammit!  Now go out there and win me
            that festival!
-- Burns puts his foot down, 

At dinner, Jay and Homer fight over the last pork chop.

Marge: Homer, the guest should get the last pork chop.
Homer: But I'm still hungry!
        [under the table, Jay's and Homer's stomach growl at each other
       like dogs]
        [Homer's frightens Jay's into whimpering]
  Jay: [taking the pork chop] Thank you!
 Lisa: Mr. Sherman, I understand you have two Pulitzer prizes.
  Jay: Well, I, heh heh, it's not like I carry them around with me.
       Ooh, it's so hot in here!
        [removes sweater to reveal Pulitzers]
       Oh, look!  Here's my Peoples' Choice award.  Five Golden Globes
       --
        [puts legs on table; Globes roll out of pant leg]
       Hmm...where's my Emmy?
        [Santa's Little Helper coughs it up]
       Thank you!
-- Jay, never arrogant, 

Homer: Oh yeah?  [pulls out a trophy] Well _I_ won the belching contest
       at work.  [belches in Jay's face]
        [everyone laughs]
  Jay: Very nice, Homer.  [belches way longer and louder]
        [car alarms go off outside]
        [everyone but Homer applauds]
        [Bart hands Jay the belching trophy]
 Lisa: Wow!  How many Pulitzer prize winners can do that?
  Jay: Just me and Eudora Welty.
-- Subdivisions in the Pulitzer prize winning elite, 

       [the doorbell rings]
Marge: Oh, I invited my sisters over.
  Jay: Ooh, sisters.  Allow me.
        [walks off to answer door; screams]
  Jay: [on the couch] So then _I_ said to Woody Allen, "Well, Camus can
       do, but Sartre is smartre!"
        [Patty laughs]
Selma: So original.
Marge: How droll!
Homer: Yeah, well, "Scooby Doo can doo-doo, but Jimmy Carter is
       smarter."
        [a bale of detritus blows across the living room]
-- There weren't no sound but the whistling breeze..., 

Patty: OK, Sherman, you're a movie expert.
Selma: So tell us: who's gay?
  Jay: Oh, I don't know...Harvey Fierstein.
Selma: No!
Patty: Who else?
        [Homer whispers to Jay]
  Jay: Oh.  MacGyver's gay.
        [both sisters growl at Jay, who cowers]
        [Homer giggles behind the couch]
 Bart: [laughs] You badmouthed MacGyver, didn't you?
  Jay: [hanging from the eavestrough in his underwear] Uh...muh uh?
-- The meaning of negative reinforcement, 

That night, in bed, Marge writes something on a pad of paper.

Homer: Whatcha doing, Marge?
Marge: Making out the jury list for the film festival.  Mayor Quimby,
       Krusty, Jay [giggles]...
Homer: Marge, do you respect my intelligence?
Marge: [long pause] Yes.
Homer: OK.  [turns over] Wait a minute...why did it take you so long to
       say yes?
Marge: [long pause] No reason.
Homer: OK.  [turns over] Wait a minute...are you humoring me?
Marge: [long pause] [resigned] Yes.
Homer: OK.  [turns over] Wait a minute...that's bad!
-- Homer's lightning-fast reasoning ability, 

Homer: Look, I know I'm not witty like that critic guy, but does he know
       _all_ the words to the Oscar Mayer song?
  Jay: [walking past, singing] Oh, I wish I were an Oscar Mayer weiner,
        [Bart and Lisa join in] That is what I'd truly like to be.
       'Cause if I were an Oscar Mayer weiner,
        [Jay solos out of tune] Everyone would be in love with me!
        [SLH howls]
Homer: That's it, Marge: he knows the whole hot dog song!  Go ahead,
       sleep with him.  I'll just take a lock of your hair to remember
       you by.  [snips one from her] It's just me and you now, lock of
       hair.
Marge: You don't have to do this.
Homer: Yeah?  Well you think I'm stupid!
Marge: I don't think you're stupid.
Homer: Prove it!  Put me on that film jury festival thing.
Marge: [resigned] Fine, you're on the jury.
        [crosses off "Martin Scorsese", writes in "Homer"]
-- So close for Scorsese and yet so far, 

Mr. Burns is seated in an auditorium.

  Smithers: Sir, the actors are here to audition for the part of you.
     Burns: Excellent.
             [Anthony Hopkins is wheeled in restrained a la Hannibal
            Lecter]
   Hopkins: Excellent.  [hisses]
     Burns: Next!
             [William Shatner appears, dressed as Captain Kirk]
   Shatner: Ex...cel-lent!
     Burns: Next!
     Homer: Exactly.  Heh, heh...d'oh!
     Burns: Next!
Chespirito: Exellente!
Spielbergo: Es muy bueno.
     Burns: Oh, it's hopeless.  I'll have to play myself.
-- 

The night of the film festival, Dr. Hibbert approaches the theater in
fishnet stockings.  "Oh, I thought they were playing `The Rocky Horror
Picture Show' tonight," chuckles the doctor.

Inside, Jay announces, "Our first film is by Indian director Apu
Nahasapeemapetilon: `Bright Lights, Beef Jerky'."  The film is clearly
lifted directly from the Kwik-E-Mart security camera, where Snake cocks
a shotgun at Apu.  "Help, help!  Police!" calls Apu.  Wiggum retorts,
"Hey, I got problems of my own right now," as his tie is pulled slowly
into the hot dog rotating machine.  "Oh boy, this is going to get worse
before it gets better..." The tape ends, and everyone applauds.

Jay continues, "Next, we have Moe the Bartender in `Moe Better Booze'."
Moe, donning a tuxedo, makeup, and a cane, dances on top of his bar and
sings, "Money gets you one more round/Drink it down, you stupid
clown/Money gets you one more round/You're out on your ass."  He falls
off his bar and yells, "Ow!  My back!"  Everyone applauds this one
politely too.

In the next film, Hans Moleman narrates, "Hans Moleman productions
presents `Man Getting Hit By Football'."  Hans stands on a walkway;
someone tosses a football at him.  It hits him right in the groin, and
he doubles over in pain.

Homer: [laughing hysterically] This contest is over!  Give that man the
       $10,000.
  Jay: This isn't "America's Funniest Home Videos".
Homer: But...the ball!  His groin!  Ah ha!  It works on so many levels!
       [laughs more] Roll it again.
-- Hans Moleman hits Homer's funny bone, 

Barney: Next, they're going to show _my_ movie.
  Bart: _You_ made a movie?
Barney: _I_ made a movie?  No wonder I was on the cover of
        "Entertainment Weekly".
-- Barney's short-term memory, 

Barney's movie is in black and white.  It opens with a shot of a Duff
beer bottle on a windowsill.  Gauzy white curtains billow around it as
the love theme from "M.  Butterfly" plays.  A hand grabs the bottle and
turns it upside down; the camera pans slowly down to reveal Barney's
lips on the other end of it.

The next shot shows Barney from above lying on a couch under the window.
As a voiceover, he says, "My name is Barney Gumbel.  I'm 40, I'm single,
and I drink."  The scene fades to a road where Barney lies in the
gutter, drinking another Duff, then lying down.  The Duff pours slowly
into a sewer grating.  "There's a line in `Othello' about a drinker:
`Now a sensible man, by and by a fool, and presently a beast.'  That
pretty well covers it."  The camera shows a time lapse view of clouds
moving during the day, which turns to night, then back to day again.
Barney has become an old man, bald, toothless, still lying in the same
gutter.  A tear leaks from his eye.

A woman watching the movie is moved.

 Woman: It's brilliant: savagely honest, tender...he has the soul of a
        poet.
Barney: You're very kind.
 Woman: Excuse me, did something crawl down your throat and die?
Barney: It didn't die!
-- Methinks the man doth protest too much, 

Back on the screen, Barney sits in a chair and says, "My name is Barney
Gumbel, and I'm an alcoholic."  The camera pulls back to reveal several
similarly-attired girls.  Lisa says, "Mr. Gumbel, this is a Girl Scout
meeting."  Barney asks, "Is it?  Or is it that you girls can't admit you
have a problem?"

The scene fades to a playing record player, then back to Barney on the
couch, a rose held to his nose.  "Don't cry for me," he narrates, "I'm
already dead."  He puts the rose in the Duff bottle on the windowsill;
its petals fall off slowly, and the curtain billows in front of it as
"Fin" appears.

Everyone applauds wildly; Marge blows her nose.  "I think we have a
winner," says Jay.  Homer walks in holding a beer and asks, "What'd I
miss?"  Marge chides him, "Homer, please pay attention!  There's just
one more movie."  That movie is "A Burns for All Seasons", starring
Montgomery Burns as Montgomery Burns, Bumblebee Man, and Tommy Tune as
"Smithers".  The title sequence features the picture from the Sistene
Chapel of God touching Adam's finger, except instead of Adam, it's
Burns.  A long list of writers scrolls by, ending with Lowell Burns and
Babaloo Smithers.

The first scene opens with Mr. Burns atop a horse wearing a sombrero,
rounds of machine gun ammunition draped across his chest.  "Simple
villagers," he says to a group of people, "I promise you I will close
plants in America and bring work here!"  Chespirito cries, "Viva Senor
Burns!" and the assembled villagers cry, "Viva!  Viva!"  Burns' horse
gallops off, but Burns doesn't manage to stay in the saddle, instead
getting dragged back and forth along the ground.  In the audience, Burns
laments, "We did twenty takes, and _that_ was the best one."

The next scene features Mr. Burns saying, "Remember, Elliot, I'll be
right here," on one knee to a child.  The tip of his finger lights up
briefly; he then enters a spaceship, its door spiraling closed, which
takes off into the crimson sky.  The audience murmurs angrily among
themselves, "Pure egotism!  Self-indulgent tripe," and the like.  "I
don't care what they say," vows Burns, "I'm going to win this festival!"

The next scene shows a Roman centurion on a horse leading a group of
shackled prisoners across the desert.  The last prisoner, who bears a
striking resemblance to Charlton Heston, collapses from exhaustion.  A
shadow appears over him: a man kneels in front of him, strokes his hair,
and hands him a bottle of spring water.  "Drink up, Judah Ben Hur,"
exhorts Mr. Burns.  Ben Hur does so, then looks up gratefully and says,
"You truly are the king of kings."  A heavenly light shines down upon
Burns, and he says "Excellent."  The movie ends.

Audience: Boo!  Boo!
   Burns: Smithers...are they booing me?
Smithers: Uh, no, they're saying "Boo-urns!  Boo-urns!"
   Burns: Are you saying "boo" or "Boo-urns"?
Audience: Boo!  Boo!
    Hans: I was saying "Boo-urns"...
-- Burns' movie flops, 

[End of Act Two.  Time: 17:09]

The judging decision is being made.

 Marge: All right: it's time to vote for the grand prize.
   Jay: I vote for Barney Gumbel's sensitive yet unfortunately-titled
        film, "Pukahontas".
 Marge: Second.
Quimby: Well, I vote for Burns' movie.
Krusty: Me too.  Now let's get going.  I've got a date with Eudora
        Welty.  [a huge burp can be heard] Coming, Eudora!
         [a miniature camera hidden in an olive whirs]
 Burns: [watching] Excellent.  Bribing those two judges had paid off,
        just as it did during the Miss Teen America pageant.
         [holds up newspaper with "Incontinent Old Man Wins Miss Teen
        America" headline]
   Jay: How can you vote for Burns' movie?
Krusty: Let's just say it moved me...to a bigger house!  Oops, I said
        the quiet part loud and the loud part quiet.
-- No one is secure from bribery, 

  Jay: Two to two.  Well, Homer, it all comes down to you.
Homer: "Football in the Groin".  "Football in the Groin"!
  Jay: Well, we're not going to resolve this deadlock any time soon.
Marge: Why don't we all take a five minute break?  It'll clear our
       heads.
Homer: Good idea, Marge: my mind is going a mile a minute.
        [inside Homer's head, one monkey picks fleas off another]
-- Homer, still a primate, 

Marge rues her decision to put Homer on the judging committee.

 Marge: I knew this would happen.  I put you on the jury and you vote
        for the stupidest film.
 Homer: I have every right to be on that jury, even though I got there
        because I'm sleeping with the head of the festival.
   Jay: How many times have I heard Rex Reed say _that_?
 Homer: Oh, great, now _you're_ going to make fun of me!
   Jay: No, Homer, I won't make fun of you.  But I will suggest there
        may be better things in life than seeing a man get hit in the
        groin with a football.
         [a football hits Jay in the groin]
Nelson: [off-camera] Ha ha!
 Marge: Well, Homer?
 Homer: Marge, I've got some serious thinking to do.
         [inside his head, two monkeys do calculus on a blackboard]
-- Homer, still a primate, albeit an advanced one, 

Homer watches Barney's movie again to make his final decision.

 Homer: [thinking] Hmm...Barney's movie had heart, but "Football in the
        Groin" had a football in the groin.
Barney: [on the screen] Don't cry for me, I'm already dead.
 Homer: Wow.  I'll never drink another beer.
   Man: Beer here!
 Homer: I'll take ten.
-- "Never" meaning "right away", 

The audience reassembles for the final announcement.  Jay announces,
"And now to announce the winner.  The award for outstanding animated
short goes to...Itchy and Scratchy for their film, `Four Funerals and a
Wedding'."  Scratchy stands with his bride in front of a priest when
Itchy runs on and abducts her.  He replaces her with a similar-looking
bride made entirely of bombs and dynamite, their fuses burning.
Scratchy kisses her blithely, wipes her mouth blithely, then lives the
rest of his life blithely, producing children that are also made of
bombs and dynamite.  In his old age, he sits with his bride in an old
folks' home when she finally explodes, turning he and his rocking chair
into charred skeletons.  A bearded Itchy walks up to point and laugh,
but the exertion gives him a heart attack and he keels over.  The
audience, of course, laughs.

   Jay: And now, the winner of the grand prize.  [tears open an
        envelope] Barney Gumbel!
Barney: What?  Wow!
 Burns: [shudders]
 Marge: Homey, you voted for the right movie.  I'm glad you were on the
        jury.  [kisses him]
 Homer: Aw.  You know something, Marge?  It's not that tough being a
        film cricket.
Barney: [at the podium] I've learned I have a gift to share with the
        world.  From now on, there'll be a new Barnard Gumbel:
        hardworking, clean, and sober.
Quimby: Congratulations, Barney, and enjoy your grand prize: a lifetime
        supply of Duff beer.
Barney: Huh?  [pulls up sleeve] Just hook it to my veins!
-- Even the greatest idol has a few vices, 

The Simpson family take Jay to the airport to see him off.

 Lisa: Goodbye, Mr. Sherman.  If I ever play Carnegie Hall, I'll give
       you a call.
  Jay: And if you ever want to visit _my_ show --
 Bart: Nah, we're not going to be doing that.
Marge: Well, Jay, I hope you tell your New York friends that people in
       small towns aren't quite as dumb as they think.
Homer: Marge, look!  This has spring snakes inside but the suckers will
       think it's beer nuts.  [laughs] Mmm...beer nuts.
        [opens jar; spring snakes fly out] Aah!  D'oh!
-- Not _all_ people, that is, 

  Marge: Well, it was a lovely festival.  The best movie won, and Mr.
         Burns found there are some awards that can't be bought.
          ["Six months later"]
Rainier: And the Oscar goes to...
  Burns: I've got to win this one!  I bribed everyone in Hollywood.
Rainier: ...George C. Scott in "Man Getting Hit By Football".
          [everyone applauds; Burns steams]
          [a screen shows George C. Scott standing there and a football
         hitting him in the groin]
  Scott: [doubling over] Aargh!  My groin.
-- Hollywood's new integrity, 

[End of Act Three.  Time: 21:07]
 EPISODE TITLE: Lisa's Wedding


EPISODE SUMMARY: 
[Syndication cuts are marked in curly braces "{}" and are courtesy of
Frederic Briere.]

The scene opens with majestic music and a banner, "Knight Battle To-
daye".  Two knights fight on the lawn, one with a sword and shield, the
other with a spiked ball.  The one with the spiked ball pounds the other
in the head, knocking him over.

     Ned: Zounds, I did thee mightily smitily!
           [assembled audience under "Springfield Renaissance Fair"
          clap]
          "Zounds" is a renaissance English word short for "God's
          wounds" but the "smitily", that's pure Flanders!
Smithers: [lying on the ground] [raising his visor] Please, call a
          doctor.
    Bart: [whining] Oh, these renaissance fairs are so boring.
   Marge: Oh, really?  Did you see the loom?  [camera turns to it] I
          took loom in high school.
           [Marge hums, quickly weaves "Hi Bart, I am weaving on a
          loom"]
    Bart: [pause] Meh.
-- Marge's hidden talents, 

A pig with an apple in its mouth rotates on a spit over a fire.  Homer,
an apple in _his_ mouth, looks it in the eyes and rotates his head in
synch.

Doris: Yon meat, 'tis sweet as summer's wafting breeze.
Homer: Can I have some?
Doris: Mine ears are only open to the pleas of those who speak ye olde
       English.
Homer: Sweet maiden of the spit, grant now my boon, that I might sup on
       suckling pig this noon.
Doris: Whatever.
-- Homer, linguist, 

Homer's plea succeeds.  He walks alongside Lisa, mowing down on pig.

Homer: Oh, I've eaten eight different meats.  I am a true renaissance
       man!  [takes a huge bite]
 Lisa: I'll go to the first aid tent and tell them to plug in ye olde
       stomach pump.
-- Wonderful medieval technology, 

Lisa walks up to Police Chief Wiggum who's dressed in a friar's garb.
He stands at the entrance of a tent with a sign, "Friar Wiggum's
Fantastical Beastarium".

        [Lisa walks up]
Wiggum: Alight your gaze on yonder fabled beasts of yore.
         [motions to chimera and manticore pictures]
         [inside the tent]
        Behold, the rarest of the rare, the mythological two-headed
        hound born with only one head.
         [a regular dog wags its tail with a bored look]
        Ooh, and here, out of the mists of history, the legendary
        esquilax, a horse with the head of a rabbit and the body of a
        rabbit.
         [the rabbit hops out of its pen]
        Oh, it's galloping away.
  Lisa: [chasing it] Here, bunny bunny.  Here, bunny.
Wiggum: [correcting her] "Here, esquilax".
-- Fantastical, indeed, 

Lisa chases the rabbit off into the forest, laughing at first, but soon
the woods close in around her, and she looks frightened.  She comes upon
a tent, lit inside.  She pulls back the opening flap to reveal a woman
dressed like a gypsy sitting at a table, candles burning all around her.

Woman: I've been waiting for you, Lisa.
 Lisa: [gasps] How did you know my name?
Woman: Your nametag.  ["Hi, I'm Lady Lisa"] Would you like to know your
       future?
 Lisa: Heh, sorry, I don't believe in fortune telling.  I should go.
Woman: What's your hurry?  Bart and Maggie and Marge are at the joust,
       and Homer is heckling the puppet show.
 Lisa: [gasps] Wow, you _can_ see into the...present.
-- Lisa meets the soothsayer, 

Woman: Now we'll see what the future holds.
        [turns over a card from what looks like a Tarot deck]
 Lisa: [gulps] The "Death" card?
Woman: No, that's good: it means transition, change.
 Lisa: [relieved] Oh.
        [the woman turns over another card]
 Lisa: Oh, that's cute.
Woman: [gasps] "The Happy Squirel"!
 Lisa: [timid] That's bad?
Woman: Possibly.  The cards are vague and mysterious.
-- The science of tarot card reading, 

  Woman: They seem to be revealing the story of your first love.  Do you
         want me to continue?
   Lisa: [gulps] Guess so.
  Woman: [concentrating] It's coming to me...yes, I see an eastern
         university in the year 2010.  The world has become a very
         different place.
          [in the future, many robots clatter past]
          [they walk past a sign saying "Wizard of Oz auditions today"]
          [these are followed by a scarecrow and a lion]
Student: I can't wait to see that play.
-- The storytelling begins, 

One of the trees in a courtyard flickers and buzzes like a bad TV
picture.  A student walks up to it and kicks it; a plaque at the base
reads, "In memory of a real tree".  An older Lisa wearing jeans and a
pink sweater walks down the stairs and fixes her hair.  She walks
towards a drinking fountain, only to knock heads with a man who got the
same idea at the same time.  "Hey, watch it!" they say to each other.
The man drinks from the fountain then walks away as Lisa comments, "That
man is instantly the most annoying person I have ever met," and growls.

"A soy-based snack will calm me down," she reasons, walking over to a
"Soy Pops" vending machine.  Someone uses a card to purchase the last
Soy Pop ("Now with Gag Suppressant"); of course, it is the annoying man.
Lisa sees what he has done and growls again.

The man walks into an elevator and closes the door just before Lisa can
get on.  "Agh!  Him again," she says, walking up the stairs.  At the
top, breathless, she walks up to a library reference desk.

     Lisa: [breathless] Hello, I need "Ecosystem of the Marsh" by
           Thompson.
Librarian: The last copy was just signed out by...[checks computer] oh,
           Hugh Parkfield.  Oh, there he is.  [points]
     Lisa: No!  It couldn't be.
            [a man holding a book turns around; it isn't Hugh]
           Phew!
            [Hugh, who had been bent over, stands up]
     Hugh: Thanks for holding my book while I tied my shoe.
     Lisa: D'oh!
-- Her father's habits, 

Lisa walks up to Hugh.

     Lisa: That's the book I need.  You'll probably take forever with
           it, too.
     Hugh: I can read faster than you.
     Lisa: I read at a 78th grade level.
     Hugh: [opens book, slaps it on a table] Right here!
            [they both read frantically]
     Lisa: [much later] Finish this page?
     Hugh: Ages ago.
     Lisa: Grr...
     Hugh: I'll get the dictionary.
     Lisa: Why?
     Hugh: You'll see when you get there: the word "stochastic".
     Lisa: "Pertaining to a process involving a randomly-determined
           sequence of observations".  [laughs]
            [they look at each other, then embrace passionately]
Librarian: [looking on] Hmph.  First they hate other, now all of a
           sudden they _love_ each other.  Oh, it doesn't make any sense
           to me.
      Man: Of course not, you're a robot.
            [the librarian weeps; her tearduct malfunctions and her head
           melts]
-- The improperly designed librarian, 

Lisa and Hugh go on a date to "40 classic films starring Jim Carrey".
They walk out together afterwards, his arm around her shoulder.

Hugh: I've never met anyone who so understood the magic of Jim Carrey.
Lisa: He can make you laugh with no more than a frantic flailing of his
      limbs.
       [later, back at "Dr. &amp; Mrs. Dre Hall"]
Hugh: Mmm, I can't believe how much we have in common.  We're both
      studying the environment, we're both utterly humorless about our
      vegetarianism, and we both _love_ the Rolling Stones.
Lisa: Yes, not for the music, but for their tireless effort to preserve
      historic buildings.
Hugh: Lisa, I can't _bear_ the thought of being apart from you all
      summer.  Come back with me to Parkfield Manor.
Lisa: I'd love to!  Can we get vegetarian meals at your parents' house?
Hugh: Yes, we can, Lisa.
Lisa: _That_ is good because eating animals is wrong.
Hugh: So very wrong.
Lisa: When will the world learn?
Hugh: [mournful] I don't know.  I just don't know.
-- Two crusaders against the omnivores of the world, 

It's arranged: the two are in a plane which prepares to take off.  "I
love these new planes," exclaims Lisa.  "Yes," concurs Hugh, "it's a
good thing they reevaluated those wacky old designs."  The camera pulls
back to reveal the plane they're in has six sets of wings on it.

They fly into London past Big Ben whose clock face has been replaced
with a digital one.  It flashes "12:00" repeatedly.  A modern-sounding
car drives the two to Parkfield Manor.

  Lisa: Beautiful dinnerware, Mrs. Parkfield.
Mrs. P: Thank you, Lisa.  They were made for the finest family in
        Britain.
 Mr. P: I don't know how _we_ ended up with them.
  Lisa: [thinking] Uh oh.  Should I laugh?  Was that dry British wit, or
        subtle self-pity?  Ooh, they're staring at me, better respond.
         [laughs very tentatively]
 Mr. P: Oh, it's good to hear a boisterous American laugh!
  Lisa: And I love that painting.  Judging by the clothes, I'd say...
        seventeenth century?
Mrs. P: Actually, Lisa, it's just Uncle Eldred.
Eldred: [fishing in an empty fishbowl] I get me brain medicine from the
        National Health!
-- Neither dry British wit _nor_ subtle self-pity, 

Hugh and Lisa go for a picnic at a spot in the hills.

 Lisa: This place is so enchanting, Hugh.  I love it here!
 Hugh: I wanted this to be perfect for you.  I know you Americans like
       everything to be...fireworks.
        [some explode in the distance]
 Lisa: [gasps] Oh?  [sees a sign lighting up slowly]
        ["Lisa, will you do me the honor of giving me your hand in the
       holy tradition of matrimo --" then it burns out]
 Hugh: Oh, blast.  [speaking into his watch] Go to plan B.
        [a cow walks out with a hand-painted "Marry me" sign]
 Lisa: Yes I will!
        [they kiss]
Man 1: Isn't it wonderful?  Master Hugh has found a true love.
        [he and Man 2 both weep; their heads melt]
-- More lousy androids, 

[End of Act One.  Time: 7:13]

Lisa dials home to Marge on a videophone at Parkfield Manor.

 Lisa: Hi, Mom.
Marge: Lisa!  Hello.  How are you doing in England?  Remember, an
       elevator is called a "lift", a mile is called a "kilometer", and
       botulism is called "steak and kidney pie".
 Lisa: Guess what?  Hugh and I are getting married!
Marge: All right!  Lisa, that's _wonderful_.  If only your father were
       still with us...but he left for work a few minutes ago.
 Lisa: Mom, remember when I was little, we'd always planned my dream
       wedding and you always promised to...you know, well, keep Dad
       from ruining it?
Marge: [crossing her fingers] Oh, don't worry, honey, I guarantee your
       father will behave.
 Lisa: [nonplussed] Mom, it's a picture phone.
Marge: [looking at her fingers] This?  This?  Oh, no, I've just got a
       touch of the rheumatiz.
 Lisa: Oh.
Marge: [wipes her brow] Phew!
 Lisa: Mom, picture phone.
-- The disadvantage of technology, 

A futuristic building is shown.  Bart sits in a high-backed chair.

Bart: [on phone] Hi Mom!  Oh, that's great news about Lisa.  Well,
      listen, I better get back to work.  [hangs up]
      Heh heh, they're finally paying me for this!
       [uses a crane to demolish a building]
      Oh yeah, ha ha!
-- Bart, demolition man, 

At the Springfield Nuclear Plant ("Still operating thanks to the lengthy
appeals process"), most of the work is now done by robots.  The camera
pans past a conference room where Carl and Lenny sit across from two
other men.  Carl says, "Yes, well, the international market is my
focus," as the camera glides by onto Homer, still working at the same
work station.

   Homer: [on phone] Woo hoo!  Aw, Marge, that's great news.
Milhouse: [walking in] Hey hey, there, with the personal calls, Simpson.
   Homer: Oh, uh, but Mr. Milhouse, my little girl's getting married.
Milhouse: Lisa?  [mournful] Oh, my one true love.
           [flash to teenage, acned Milhouse behind wheel of a car]
    Lisa: It's not you, Milhouse, I just don't plan to ever get married.
           [Milhouse weeps openly]
           [back to present]
Milhouse: [threatening] I think I'll write your performance evaluation
          now, Simpson.
           [walks out]
-- Milhouse, levelheaded supervisor, 

Later, the camera pans down Evergreen Terrace past a lot of futuristic
houses, then stops on the Simpson residence which looks the same except
for shoddily-built wooden additions.

Homer: Oh, I gotta call everyone and tell them the good news.
        [picks up phone: "In use"]
       What the -- oh.  Maggie!  I need to use the phone!
        [upstairs, Maggie glowers]
       Will that girl ever shut up?  OK, Marge, I'll plan everything: we
       can have the reception at Moe's.  Wait!  Why not have the whole
       wedding there?  We'll do it on a Monday morning.  There'll be
       fewer drunks.
Marge: Homer, don't take this personally, but I've obtained a court
       order to prevent you from planning this wedding.
Homer: [reads documents] Well, these seem to be in order.  I'll be out
       back in the hammock.
-- Homer takes rejection well, 

Smithers reads his wedding invitation.

  Smithers: "Mr. Smithers plus guest"...huh.  There's only one person I
            would want to bring.
             [pulls a frozen Mr. Burns from a slot in the wall]
            Oh, Mr. Burns, we'll thaw you out the second they discover
            the cure for seventeen stab wounds in the back.  How're we
            doing, boys?
     Frink: Well, we're up to fifteen!
Scientists: Yay!
-- Dr. Frink's gainful new employment, 

Principal Skinner reads his invitation at school and thinks to himself.
He walks down the hall and looks into Miss Hoover's classroom, where
children sit in front of a TV screen, piled three high and crammed into
desks.

   Troy: {[on TV] Now turn to the next problem.  If you have three
         Pepsis and drink one, how much more refreshed are you?  You,
         the redhead in the Chicago school system?
          [a window opens up on the screen to show the girl]}
   Girl: {Pepsi?}
   Troy: {Partial credit!}
Skinner: [walking in] We've been invited to the wedding of our only
         graduate to read at an adult level.
 Hoover: Mmm, it must be Lisa Simpson, because of course Martin Prince
         perished in that science fair explosion.
          [camera pans down below the earth]
 Martin: [dressed as The Phantom] Not quite perished, my lady love,
         although some days I wish I had.
          [starts playing "A Fifth of Beethoven" on an organ]
-- A fate truly worse than death, 

Hugh and Lisa leave the airport in a car belonging to the Otto Cab Co.
(established 2003).

  Lisa: [to cab driver] Hey, I remember you!  Mayor Quimby, right?
Quimby: I, uh, er, uh, uh, no.  Look at this licence: Mohammed Jafar.
  Otto: [on screen] Quimby, after this fare, get your indicted ass out
        to the convention center.
Quimby: [to himself] I cut the ribbon at that convention center.
-- At least he's not illiterate, 

 Lisa: [laughing nervously] Just a couple more blocks to my house!
       [laughs more, then starts hyperventilating]
 Hugh: Lisa, darling, don't worry: I'm sure I'll get along with your
       family.  You've so thoroughly prepared me for the worst.  As long
       as they're not squatting in a ditch poking berries up their
       noses...
 Lisa: [breathing heavily] And if they are?
 Bart: [seeing them] Here they come: raise the flag!
        [Homer does so; it sparks as it touches something electrical]
Marge: Oh, Lisa!
Homer: Yo, Hugh!  Here's a little bit of US hospitality: whaddaya think
       of _that_?
        [the flag is now on fire]
        [Hugh gasps]
 Lisa: Dad!
Homer: Aah!
        [he and Bart pull it down and stomp on it]
Marge: Now throw compost on it!
        [they do so]
Homer: Whew!  [hands the flag to Hugh] Er, enjoy.
 Hugh: Oh...[a tear forms] it's still warm.
        [Lisa hyperventilates some more]
-- Sounds worse than the berries scenario, 

[End of Act Two.  Time: 11:53]

Hugh is led to his room by Homer.

Homer: You can be the first to try out the new guest bedroom I built.
       [quietly] Remember, if the building inspector comes by, it's not
       a room, it's a window box.  [walks out]
 Lisa: [hugging Hugh] Oh, Hugh, thank you.  You've been just wonderful
       through this entire ordeal.
 Hugh: Lisa, I love you so much I'm willing to go through anything.
        [falls through the floor onto the compost heap]
 Lisa: [gasps] Are you OK?
 Hugh: [strained] I'm fine, Lisa.  Fortunately, the compost heap broke
       my fall.  Be a dear: run a bath.
-- He didn't mean literally, 

At dinner, the rest of the family chows down like nobody's business
while Hugh stares on, aghast.

 Marge: Homer!  Bart!  Maggie!  Company eating rules.
 Homer: [burps] Oh, right.
         [everyone eats all delicate, like]
  Bart: Anyway, Hugh, there's more to my life than just the wrecking
        ball: I also crush cars into cubes.  And on the side, I promote
        local tough man contests.  Basically, I'm getting out all my
        aggression 'till I go to law school.
 Homer: So, Hugh: have you heard all the latest American jokes?  Uh...
        here's a good one: pull my finger!
  Hugh: [chuckles] Yes, we have that one in England, too, Mr. Simpson.
 Homer: [threatening] I said pull my finger.
  Lisa: [nervous] Uh, Mom?  We've got my wedding dress fitting this
        afternoon.  Maggie, if you're not doing anything, why don't you
        come with us?
Maggie: Mmm --
 Marge: Maggie!  Don't talk with your mouth full.
         [Maggie glowers]
 Homer: Me and Bart will take you out on the town this afternoon.
  Lisa: Hugh should take it easy because of his fall.
  Hugh: Oh, Lisa, please, the only thing bruised in that fall was my
        spine.  I'd be delighted.
 Homer: Great.  There's only one thing I ask in return.
  Hugh: Certainly.
 Homer: Pull my finger!
-- The first family dinner together, 

In the car, Hugh covers his eyes and screams while Homer yells, "So,
this driving on the left makes you feel more at home, huh, Hugh?"

At Moe's, the 1500 channel cable has Kent Brockman reading the news for
CNNBCBS (a division of ABC).

Kent: [on TV] And tonight, the following celebrities have been arrested
      -- [a list scrolls by] -- while Heather Locklear-Fortensky remains
      at large.  Remember, if you see any celebrities, consider them
      dangerous.
Hugh: You know, I rather like this pub.
 Moe: Oho, an English boy, huh?  You know, we saved your ass in World
      War II.
Hugh: Yeah, well, we saved _your_ arse in World War III.
 Moe: [conciliatory] That's true.
-- A quick comeback at Moe's, 

Homer: Hugh, there's something I want you to have.  My Dad gave me his
       cufflinks on the day I married Marge and they brought us good
       luck.  I couldn't imagine a happier marriage.  We don't have many
       traditions in our family, but it would mean a lot to me if you
       kept this one alive.
 Hugh: Well I'd be honored...
        [opens case; cufflinks are a bride and groom pig]
       ...to wear those...things.
Homer: Aw.
-- Homer, not too perceptive, 

{Bart wears a headset and gloves and mimes playing pool.  Another man,
also wearing a headset and gloves, mimes throwing a dart.  He tosses it,
and Bart reels forward.  "Ow!  Hey, watch those virtual darts.  I'm
trying to play virtual pool."  He swings his virtual cue and hits the
man; the man grabs a virtual chair and breaks it on Bart.  The two fight
some more until Moe calls, "Hey, hey!  No fighting in my bar," and
pushes a button which emits a high-pitched tone straight into their
ears.  They writhe on the ground in pain.}

That night, in bed, Marge watches TV.

Marge: You know, Fox turned into a hardcore sex channel so gradually, I
       didn't even notice.  Yeesh!  [turns TV off]
Homer: Marge, it's so great to have the whole family together under one
       roof.  I never realized how much I missed it!  Listen to the
       murmurs in the next room...the house is full of life again.
       [pounds on wall] Keep it down in there!
 Lisa: All right, Dad!  [sighs] I'm sorry I left you alone with Homer
       and Bart.
 Hugh: [weakly] No, no, honey: I had a fine time.
 Lisa: How did you get that gash on your forehead?
 Hugh: Oh, that was when we hid in the dumpster, after the fire alarm
       went off in the pornographic magazine warehouse.
 Lisa: Oh, you are so good to put up with all of this.
 Hugh: Oh, don't be silly, Lisa.  Everything's fine, really.  Now go to
       sleep: we have a _big_ day ahead of us tomorrow, a big, long day.
        [they kiss; Lisa turns over]
        [Hugh drums his fingers together apprehensively]
-- Trouble in fiance land, 

The next day...

Marge: Lisa, I can't _believe_ it's your wedding day already.
 Lisa: Mom, I feel kind of funny wearing white.  I mean...Milhouse.
Marge: [dismissive] Oh, Milhouse doesn't count.
        [they both laugh]
 Lisa: OK, I've got something old, that's my pearl necklace, something
       new is the wedding dress, something borrowed is this antique
       brooch from Hugh's mother...now I just need something blue.
Marge: [cuts a lock of her hair] Here.
 Lisa: Oh, Mom, thanks.
        [they hug]
-- Gray as a mule since seventeen, 

A tent has been set up for the wedding, the shadow of the power plant
looming large in the background.  In a nearby stream, some horribly
mutated fish hop out of the water.

Lisa prepares herself in front of a mirror.

Bart: Wow, Lisa, looking at you makes me want to get married for a third
      time.  I met a really nice exotic dancer the other night at Hugh's
      bachelor party.
Lisa: Hugh didn't have a bachelor party.
Bart: We had one in his honor.
       [Lisa looks glum]
      _I_ had one in his honor.
       [Lisa continues to look glum]
       [abashed] I went to a strip club.
-- True confessions, 

Hugh prepares to introduce Homer to his parents.

 Hugh: [sighs heavily] Well, here goes nothing.  Mum, Dad...meet Homer
       Simpson.
        [they exchange pleasantries]
Homer: [long pause] You know what's great about you English?
       "Octopussy".  Man, I must have seen that movie...twice!
 Hugh: [weakly] Yes...yes!  Well, that's not too bad.
-- Preparing for the worst, 

{Patty and Selma walk into the tent past an older Mr. and Mrs.
Flanders.}

   Patty: {Hey, Krabappel: if you get in the way of that bouquet, I'll
          stuff that sunhat down your neck.}
   Burns: [being wheeled in] Smithers, take me home!  I'm not fully
          defrosted.
Smithers: Nonsense!  Just sit down and rest for a moment.  There you go.
           [Burns' bottom half breaks off]
   Burns: Ow!
Smithers: Oh, no.  We've got a little situation here.
   Burns: I can't feel anything below my cummerbund.
-- The wedding guests arrive, 

Homer checks on Lisa.

Homer: Ooh la la!
 Lisa: Hi, Dad.
Homer: You look great, sweetheart.
 Lisa: [abashed] Thanks.
Homer: Little Lisa, Lisa Simpson.  You know, I always felt you were the
       best thing my name ever got attached to.  Since the time you
       learned to pin your own diapers, you've been smarter than me.
 Lisa: Oh, Dad --
Homer: No, no, let me finish.  I just want you to know I've always been
       proud of you.  You're my greatest accomplishment and you did it
       all yourself.  You helped me understand my own wife better and
       taught me to be a better person, but you're also my daughter, and
       I don't think anybody could have had a better daughter than you
       --
 Lisa: Dad, you're babbling.
Homer: See?  You're still helping me.
-- The joy of children, 

 Lisa: [noticing the cufflinks] Hey Dad, did you forget to give those
       cufflinks to Hugh?
Homer: Uh...no.
 Lisa: Well?
Homer: I found them on the nightstand this morning and...well, I guess
       they weren't his cup of tea.  Don't worry about it.
 Lisa: But you've been going on about these all week.  I'm sure he just
       forgot.
        [walks to where Hugh is preparing]
 Hugh: Lisa, we're not supposed to see each other before the wedding.
       It's tradition.
 Lisa: What about _my_ family's tradition?  [holds up cufflinks]
 Hugh: Surely you don't want me to wear those?  In front of my parents
       and their friends?
 Lisa: But you promised my Dad you would.
 Hugh: I was just humoring him, darling.  Actually, he frightens me a
       bit.
 Lisa: I know they look a little silly but his feelings will be hurt if
       you don't wear them.
 Hugh: [resigned] Fine.  [wears them]
-- The delicate issue of the cufflinks, 

Hugh: I must say, you were right.  This has been quite trying.  You
      know, I've attempted to enjoy your family on a personal level, on
      an ironic level, as a novelty, as camp, as kitsch, as cautionary
      example...nothing works.  Frankly, I'll be quite relieved when we
      get back to England and we won't have to deal with them.
Lisa: Are you saying we won't see my family again?
Hugh: Well, possibly your mother will come when the children are born.
Lisa: I can't believe I'm hearing this.  I don't want to cut my family
      out of my life.
Hugh: Really?  But Lisa, you're better than this place: you're like a
      flower that grew out of a pot of dirt.
Lisa: That's a horrible thing to say!
Hugh: Well, come on, _you_ complain about them more than anyone.
Lisa: Maybe, but I still love them!  And I don't think you understand
      that.
       [walks out, leaving the ring in Hugh's hand]
-- 

Meanwhile, in the main tent...

   Lovejoy: And now, to sing "Amazing Grace", Miss Maggie Simpson.
   Hibbert: Heh heh, she's quite a hellion but she does have an
            incredible voice.
    Maggie: Ahem.  [breathes in]
      Hugh: [rushing in] Stop everything!  The wedding has been called
            off.
             [everyone gasps and chatters]
Nelson Sr.: Ha ha!
Nelson Jr.: Ha ha!
    Krusty: Ohh...
   Lovejoy: Uh, this is very sad news, and it never would have happened
            if the wedding had been inside the church with God instead
            of out here in the cheap showiness of nature.
     Doris: Who wants cake?
             [everyone stampedes for it]
-- A happy ending for some, 

Lisa walks out past a line of guests, dejected, and into a nearby wood.
She weeps.  The scene fades back to young Lisa, who turns around to see
the soothsayer in her tent.

Woman: The next day, Hugh goes back to England, and you never see him
       again.
 Lisa: Wow.  Now that I know all this, isn't there any way to change the
       future?
Woman: No...but try to look surprised.
 Lisa: I thought you said you'd tell me about my _true_ love.
Woman: Oh, you'll have a true love, but I specialize in foretelling the
       relationships where you get jerked around.
        [laughs manically; throws a smoke bomb and continues to laugh]
        [the smoke clears, and she's still sitting there]
-- Less-than-spectacular exits, 

As Lisa walks out of the tent, the bunny (er, esquilax) hops into her
arms.  She carries it back to Friar Wiggum's and puts it in its box.

Homer: Lisa, Lisa!  Where were you?  You missed the most incredible
       thing.
 Lisa: [grateful] Hi, Dad!  [hugs him]
Homer: I ate seven pounds of fudge!
 Lisa: Wow!
Homer: The man at the stand said it was a record.
 Lisa: Wow!  What else did you do, Dad?
Homer: I rode the teacups, then I got a little sick and I had to sit
       down.  But then, I rode them again...
-- All's well, 

[End of Act Three.  Time: 20:57]

The theme music over the credits is medieval sounding, with a lute and
harp.  The Gracie Films music is played with trumpets and a harp.
 EPISODE TITLE: Two Dozen & One Greyhounds


EPISODE SUMMARY: 
[Syndication cuts are marked in curly braces "{}" and are courtesy of
Frederic Briere.]

Bart watches TV alone.

Kent: Welcome to the six o'clock news in our brand new studio.  Lookin'
      good, Springfield!
       [he waves to the people out the large window behind him]
      In today's news, a two-ton rhino escaped from the Springfield Zoo,
      but zoo officials were quick to act, and Petunia, as she is known,
      is safely back in captivity.
       [a large rhino gores people outside the window]
      In other news, a three-ton rhino that escaped from the zoo last
      week is still at large.
-- America's violentest home videos, "Two Dozen &amp; One Greyhounds"

Marge walks in angrily.

Marge: All right, who broke my vase?
 Lisa: Who took all my test papers off the refrigerator and tore them
       up?
Homer: Who spread garbage all over Flanders' yard before I got a chance
       to?
 Bart: Oh, please.  This is senseless destruction with none of my usual
       social commentary.
        [SLH runs in, destroying a pillow, then runs out]
 Lisa: If it wasn't you, then who was it?
        [SLH chases Snowball II in, a knife in his jaws]
Marge: Well, I'm sure these things didn't destroy themselves, now, did
       they?
Homer: [worried] Did they?
        [SLH runs in, shreds Homer's shirt]
       Hmm.  I guess Bart's not to blame.  Which is lucky, too, because
       it's spanking season, and I got a hankering for some spankering!
-- No duck or wabbit season 'round Springfield, "Two Dozen &amp; One
    Greyhounds"

Bart and Lisa take SLH outside.  "I don't know why you're so energetic
today, boy," says Bart, tossing a ball into the air, "but prepare to be
worn out!"  He and Lisa stand about ten feet apart and toss a ball back
and forth.  SLH chases it eagerly.  "What's wrong, boy, getting tired?"
taunts Lisa, and both she and her brother laugh.  Later, SLH chases it
just as eagerly, while Bart and Lisa seem to be tiring out.  That night,
the two lie on the ground, almost asleep, rolling the ball back and
forth between them.  SLH continues to chase it unabated.

The next day at breakfast, Bart and Lisa look tired.

    Marge: I think there's really something wrong with Santa's Little
           Helper.  He was up barking all night, and dug up the back
           yard worse than ever.
            [they all look out the window at the dug-up back yard]
     Lisa: [gasps] My bongo drums!
     Bart: [gasps] My strobelight!
    Homer: [gasps] My "Best of Ray Stevens featuring `The Streak'"
           album!  So it was the _dog_ that buried all our stuff.
    Marge: Yes, the dog.
            [outside, SLH's head pokes up from a hole]
    Homer: Oh my God!  He's got the precious cable TV cable!
            [SLH runs through the neighborhood tearing up the cable]
            [at the Wiggums' house, the parents watch "Kent's Kitchen"]
     Kent: Always use fresh macaroni.  If the box rattles, throw it
           away.

   Wiggum: Aw!
Announcer: Your cable TV is experiencing difficulties.  Please, do not
           panic.  Resist the temptation to read or talk to loved ones.
           Do not attempt sexual relations, as years of TV radiation
           have left your genitals withered and useless.
   Wiggum: [checking under the covers] Well I'll be damned.
-- TV, bastion of truth, "Two Dozen &amp; One Greyhounds"

The family go to the Springfield Pet Shop ("Where All Our Pets Are
Flushable").

Marge: Excuse me, we're having a problem with our dog.
Clerk: Lady, I'll tell you what I'm telling everyone else: I'm sorry if
       your dog went blind, but your gripe is with Hartz Mountain, not
       with me.
Marge: No, no!  Our dog is out of control: he's wild, destructive, and
       has little or no respect for authority.
Clerk: Hmm...let me try a canine-human mind meld.  It's an incredibly
       rare psychic power possessed only by me and three other clerks at
       this store.
        [puts his hands on SLH's face]
       OK...bruff!  Bruff!  Bruff!  [groans] I'm bored...I'm restless.
       Need change in life...ruff!...like imported leather leash,
       ruff!...Er, blue contact lenses, ruff!...200-volt shock training

Homer: Well, problem solved.  [dusts his hands together]
Marge: Homer!  Hold on to the wheel.
Homer: You got it.  [does so]
-- The wonders of modern pet psychiatry, "Two Dozen &amp; One Greyhounds"

SLH looks wistfully out the window, then morphs a la T2 out it onto the
road.  Bart cries out after him, and Homer reassures his son.

 Bart: Hey!
Homer: Don't worry: we'll catch him, or run him over trying!
 Bart: Look!  He's headed back to the greyhound racing track where we
       found him.
Homer: Don't worry, as soon as they find out he doesn't have any money,
       they'll throw him out.  Believe me, I know.
-- A tight little ball of rage, "Two Dozen &amp; One Greyhounds"

At the Springfield Dog Track ("Think of Them as Little Horses"), the
family look around for their dog.

Marge: Ooh, this place is so big.  Do you think we should split up and
       look for him, Homey?  Homey?
Homer: [at a ticket booth] Two bucks to win on number eight.  [sees
       Marge looking at him] [plaintive] And have you seen my beloved
       dog?  [laughs painfully] Gimme the ticket.
-- Homer succumbs to Gamblor, "Two Dozen &amp; One Greyhounds"

In the stands, the family are seated to watch the race.

    Homer: We can't lose!  Look at the name of the dog I bet on.
    Marge: "She's The Fastest"...Homer, I don't think that means
           necessarily --
Announcer: And they're off!  She's The Fastest jumps out to an
           insurmountable lead.
    Homer: You're lucky you got looks, Marge.
Announcer: As they round the far turn, it's She's The Fastest, followed
           by Always Comes in Second and I'm Number Three.
    Homer: Yes!  Come on, you little horse!
Announcer: And they're in the home stretch.  It's -- wait!  Another dog
           is on the track.
     Bart: It's Santa's Little Helper.
Announcer: The mystery dog is gaining fast on the outside.  Of course,
           he could never win this race...or could he?
            [SLH chases the lead dog]
     Lisa: What's Santa's Little Helper doing to that dog?
    Marge: Uh oh...
     Bart: It looks he's trying to jump over her, but he can't quite
           make it.  Come on, boy, you can do it!
            [Marge covers the children's eyes]
-- The birds having sex with the bees, "Two Dozen &amp; One Greyhounds"

The announcer mourns.

Announcer: Ladies and gentlemen, this is the end: the end of dog racing.
 Everyone: Boo!
    Marge: I think they're in love.
 Everyone: Aw...
            [the dogs lie contentedly on the track]
    Homer: Aw, so _that's_ what's been wrong with the little fellow: he
           misses casual sex.
     Lisa: Can we keep Santa's girlfriend, Mom?
     Bart: Please?
    Marge: But she's not our dog.
    Texan: She's yours now.  Once they fall in love, they lose their
           racing spirit.
    Marge: Won't you miss her loyalty and companionship?
    Texan: [guffaws heartily] Lady, you're all right.
-- I don't get it, "Two Dozen &amp; One Greyhounds"

       [SLH paws at the front door]
Marge: OK, you can go out and play, but no more you-know-what in front
       of the house, all right?
        [the dogs run out]
       Hey!  What'd I just say?
-- Time for obedience school once again, "Two Dozen &amp; One Greyhounds"

The two dogs go for a stroll.  The butcher puts a steak out on a plate
for them, as does the video store clerk and an older woman in the park
who pulls a steak from her purse.  They even get their photo taken with
their heads poking through a cardboard cutout of the "Dogs Playing
Poker" picture.  On their way to Luigi's restaurant, they spy a wrinkled
dog and laugh to themselves.  The generous chef puts a plate of
spaghetti and meatballs in front of them, saying "Take it: it fell on
the floor."  The two start slurping up the same strand of spaghetti, and
when their lips meet, they snarl at one another and fight over the
strand.

At the Simpson dinner, the dogs lie on the floor in the kitchen.

 Bart: Hey, boy, you want to play fetch?
        [SLH looks up, tired, then puts his head back down]
       Aw.  Me and Santa's Little Helper used to be a team, but he never
       wants to play any more since his bitch moved in.
Marge: Bart, don't ever say that word again!
 Bart: Well, that's what she is.  I looked it up.
Marge: Well, I'm going to write the dictionary people and have that
       checked.  Feels like a mistake to me...
-- Marge "Tipper Gore" Simpson, "Two Dozen &amp; One Greyhounds"

"Hey, look!" observes Bart, "a really small dog just fell out of Santa's
girlfriend."  Marge gasps, "Oh my God!  She's having babies.  Oh, I'm
sorry, girl, I thought you were just getting fat."  Lisa exclaims,
"Look!  It's twins."  Homer adds, "No, it's two sets of twins!"  Bart
continues, "Two sets of twins and a triplet!"  Marge exhorts Homer to
find places for all these little miracles.  They put them in a baseball
hat and glove, in a shoe, in a barbecuing apron, in the coffee, tea, and
sugar containers, and in Marge's hair.

"Oh, my, I've never seen anything like this!" says Marge.  Lisa wonders
how many more there can be.  The family counts 22, 23, 24, as the clock
spins ahead by hours and the family continue to look on.  The final
tally? 25.  The last one goes in an oven mitt on the refrigerator, which
slides down to the floor under the weight of the adorable miracle.

[End of Act One.  Time: 8:01]

{The puppies sit, assembled on the kitchen floor.}

 Lisa: {Wow, 25 puppies!}
        [Snowball II rubs her eyes, whimpers, and bats a ball of catnip
       aside]}
 Bart: {An army of dogs!  No bully will ever touch me again.

       Hey, jerkface!  You have the face of a jerk.}
Jimbo: {[running over] All right, Simpson, you asked for it --}
 Bart: {Get 'im, boys!
        [the puppies stumble and whimper towards Jimbo]
       Heh.  Say, er, Jimbo, heh, hope I wasn't out of line with that
       "jerkface" crack, heh.
        [Jimbo pounds him]}
-- Would you believe..., "Two Dozen &amp; One Greyhounds"

The humans and puppies eat dinner at the same time.  The puppies all
have personalized bowls, from "Rex" and "Fido" all the way down to
"Prince" and "The puppy formerly known as Prince".

Marge: Oh, Homey, aren't they adorable?
Homer: Yes.  We've waited many years, but the good Lord has finally
       blessed us with a real family.
        [Bart, Lisa, and Maggie glower at Homer]
-- Meal time for people and puppies alike, "Two Dozen &amp; One Greyhounds"

The family and the puppies all watch TV.  A woman in a bikini suns
herself on a boat, and one of the puppies gets up on its hind legs and
paws at the screen.  Marge chuckles, "Look at Branford II!  Isn't that
cute?  He thinks he's one of the Models, Inc.!"  The family join in
their laughter.  Snowball II, listless, tries the same stunt as Branford
II, only to be rebuked angrily by Homer: "Get that cat out of the way!"

The next morning, Bart puts on some clean socks, only to have them
attacked and shredded while they're on his feet.  He goes to the top
drawer to get some more, but it's full of puppies who tear and shred
with equal vigor.  Meanwhile, in the kitchen, Marge attaches a collar to
Lisa.

 Lisa: Mom, why do _I_ have to wear a flea collar?
Marge: Oh, it's just easier this way.
-- The simple way out, "Two Dozen &amp; One Greyhounds"

Homer opens a bag of chips in front of the TV, but each time he pulls
one out of the bag, a puppy jumps up and snatches it from his hand,
eliciting a "D'oh!" every time.  Marge walks into the kitchen later.

Marge: Yeesh, this house stinks!  You're not just putting the new
       newspapers over the old ones, are you?
Homer: Do you have a better idea?
-- Well yes, actually, "Two Dozen &amp; One Greyhounds"

Marge breaks some bad news to the kids.

    Marge: Now, I know we love the puppies very much, but I think
           they're getting to be a problem.
     Bart: Yeah, they ate all my socks.  I have to wear Lisa's to school
           today.  [Bart's socks are pink]
    Homer: How do you explain the coulottes, boy?
     Bart: [wearing a pink skirt] Well, I have to coordinate, don't I?
    Homer: Your mother and I have been thinking about giving the puppies
           away.
Bart+Lisa: No!
    Homer: Mainly your mother.
     Lisa: Is that what we do in this family?  When someone becomes an
           inconvenience, we just get rid of them?

      Abe: [picking up phone] Hello?  Is anybody there?  Aw...[hangs up]
-- Lisa, rhetoric queen, "Two Dozen &amp; One Greyhounds"

   Marge: All right, we'll give the dogs one more chance.  As long as
          the puppies don't do anything else wrong, they stay.  Hmm.  On
          a completely unrelated topic, I'm having a very, very
          important dinner party tonight.
   Homer: Splendid!  Who's coming?
   Marge: Reverend Lovejoy, your old army drill sergeant, and the
          regional director of the IRS.
           [that night]
 Lovejoy: Oh, just lovely, Marge.  The whole town will hear what a
          perfect evening this was -- how nothing at all went wrong.
Sergeant: Simpson!  This evening has gone so flawlessly, I'm going to
          forget that you were mistakenly let out of the army a month
          early.
 Auditor: And I'm so impressed by this problem-free evening that there's
          no need for that audit.
 Togther: A toast...to the Simpsons!
Sergeant: And to that delectable turkey...that's walking around the
          table?!
 Lovejoy: Dear Lord, it's a demon-bird!
           [the turkey breaks open; two puppies wrestle inside]
           [the guests retch into their napkins and leave]
Sergeant: Simpson!  See you at reveille, 0500 tomorrow.
 Auditor: See you at the IRS!
 Lovejoy: See you in hell!  [slams door, then pops head back in] From
          heaven.  [slams door]
-- The dinner goes horribly awry, "Two Dozen &amp; One Greyhounds"

Homer hammers a sign into the ground in the front yard: "Puppies for
free (or best offer)".

    Ned: Well, we sure could use a pooch to guard the flock at the
         Flanderosa.
Skinner: It'd be nice to have some companionship when mother goes out on
         dates.
    Abe: We could use a new pet over at the home seeing as how we
         accidentally killed that smart-mouth bird.
-- At the puppy giveaway, "Two Dozen &amp; One Greyhounds"

The remaining puppies howl upon seeing some of their litter being taken
away.

    Lisa: They don't like being broken up.
   Marge: We've got to be realistic, kids.  Who's going to have a big
          enough heart to take care of 25 puppies?
   Burns: [chuckling] And I know the little fellows will love romping
          around my many acres, chasing my many cars, drinking from my
          many toilets...
   Homer: Who wouldn't?
    Lisa: [whispering] Mom, don't give the puppies to him, he'll be mean
          to them.
   Marge: Hmm...she's right, Homer.  There's something about his face I
          don't trust.
           [Burns laughs evilly to himself]
   Homer: Uh, I'm sorry, Mr. Burns, but...you can't have these dogs.
          [cringes] Am I fired?
   Burns: Hmm?  Oh, of course not.  They're your pets, you can do as you
          wish.  Good day, everyone.
           [he starts to walk off with Smithers]
   Marge: My, he certainly took that well.
   Homer: A little too well, if you ask me.  I'm sure he's plotting some
          brilliant scheme to get those puppies.
           [Burns piles them into a sack while the family's backs are
          turned]
   Burns: There you go...there you go...you go, too.
Smithers: Honestly, Sir, you just don't put the effort into your schemes
          that you used to.

[End of Act Two.  Time: 13:30]

The police are called in to look for the missing dogs.  Lou eats a donut
while Chief Wiggum looks half-heartedly around the kitchen.

Wiggum: Don't worry, folks, we'll find your wallet.
 Marge: Dogs!  Chief, you're getting powdered sugar all over my floor.
Wiggum: No I'm not, no I'm not.  I'm, um, dusting for prints.
 Marge: Oh.
-- Advances in police science, "Two Dozen &amp; One Greyhounds"

Bart and Lisa decide to use the puppies' parents as trackers.  The two
dogs run off, only to drag Bart and Lisa back when Marge puts out food
for them and calls, "Dinner time, dogs!"  Chief Wiggum is apologetic:
"I'm sorry, kids, I don't think we're ever going to find your
greyhounds.  Maybe Mr. Burns will sell you one of the 25 he got last
night."

Bart and Lisa sneak off to the Burns Manor that night as the thunder
roars.  They hear yapping from an upper-floor window, and Lisa shudders,
"Who knows what horrible things he's doing to those innocent little
puppies?"  They climb a trellis and peek in a window to see Monty
bathing them all and laughing.  "Ah, there.  Now wasn't that heavenly?
And don't you feel better too?"  Lisa expresses surprise.

          [Burns takes the puppies out of a bath]
   Burns: There you are...there you go, little fellow...and you.
           [one of the puppies stands on its hind legs]
           [gasps] Smithers, look: he's standing up.  I've never seen
          anything so adorable!  Do you know who it reminds me of?
Smithers: Benji?
   Burns: No.
Smithers: Lassie?
   Burns: No, no, no, a person.  You know who I mean.
Smithers: Snoop Doggy Dogg?  Bob Barker?  David Brenner?
   Burns: No, no!  The person who's always standing and walking.
Smithers: Rory Calhoun?
   Burns: That's it!
-- Twenty Questions, Monty style, "Two Dozen &amp; One Greyhounds"

Monty picks up the obedient dog: "You stay with me; you're the pick of
the litter."  Lisa reconsiders her position: "Maybe we were wrong about
Burns on this one."  The two children shuffle along to the next window
and watch.

Smithers: Are you sure you want to go through with this, Sir?  You _do_
          have a very full wardrobe as it is.
   Burns: Yes...but not completely full.  For you see...
           [singing] Some men hunt for sport, others hunt for food,
          The only thing I'm hunting for is an outfit that looks good.
           [to the tune of "Be Our Guest"]
          See my vest, see my vest, made from real gorilla chest,
          Feel this sweater, there's no better than authentic Irish
          Setter.
          See this hat?  'Twas my cat.  My evening wear?  Vampire bat.
          These white slippers are albino African endangered rhino.
          Grizzly bear underwear; turtles' necks, I've got my share.

          Like my loafers?  Former gophers!  It was that or skin my
          chauffers,

          So let's prepare these dogs --
   Woman: Kill two for matching clogs!
   Burns: See my vest, see my vest, oh please, won't you see my vest?
           [spoken] I really like the vest.
Smithers: I gathered, yeah.
-- Disney, schmisney, "Two Dozen &amp; One Greyhounds"

Lisa is aghast.

Lisa: He's going to make a tuxedo out of our puppies!

Bart: Sorry.  You gotta admit, it's catchy.
-- Alan Mencken's greatest reward, "Two Dozen &amp; One Greyhounds"

"Come on, Smithers, let's go finish the little flea circuses off,"
sneers Monty, exiting the room with his obsequious sidekick, "except for
little Monty, of course."  Bart sweats, "We gotta get the dogs out of
there!" and opens the window.  The puppies bark happily at him.  "Shh!
Hush, puppies!" he whispers.  "We gotta get you out of here," worries
Lisa as she and Bart run to the door and look through.  Burns loads and
cocks a handgun in the next room.

Bart: I know, the window.
Lisa: No, Bart!  What are you doing?
Bart: Dogs always land on their feet.
Lisa: That's cats.
Bart: No, it's dogs.  I'll prove it.
       [drops a dog from six inches; it lands on its back]
      Best two out of three.
-- The children try to rescue the hounds, "Two Dozen &amp; One Greyhounds"

The doorhandle slowly turns.  Lisa spies a laundry chute, and Bart tries
to encourage the puppies to go down it, but they won't.  Lisa gets an
idea: she removes Bart's shoes and tosses his socks down the chute.  The
puppies follow faithfully just as Burns walks in.  "Sorry, Monty, but
you're too big for this ride," taunts Bart, following Lisa down the
chute.

 Lisa: Quick!  Let's get the --
Burns: Going somewhere?
 Bart: That's impossible.  How did you get here first?
Burns: Oh, there'll be plenty of time for explanations later.  Right
       now, I'll be taking my puppies back.
 Lisa: But they're ours.  You stole them from us!
Burns: Here's a phone.  Call somebody who cares.
        [Lisa dials 911]
       Give me that!
-- Threats taken literally, "Two Dozen &amp; One Greyhounds"

"Now if you'll excuse us, children," continues Burns, "the pups have a
date with a fashion knife."  Bart resourcefully grabs Burns' puppy from
his arms and puts it with the rest.  "There.  Now you don't know which
one's little Monty.  If you don't want him to be part of your tuxedo,
you'll have to let the other dogs go too."  Burns sees through this one:
"Come on, little Monty, stand up.  Stand up!  Do your trick."  The
children beg him not to, to no avail.  "Excellent," grins the sinister
C. M. Burns.

Bart looks around frantically, and spying some underwear and socks
hanging on a clothesline, gets an idea.  He wheels them over the dogs
heads as Burns says, "Now it's simply a matter of bending down and
picking up the one and only --" The dogs, true to form, stand up and
reach for the socks.  "This can't be happening!  They're all standing.
I can't tell them apart."  He sighs heavily.  "All right, you win: I'll
have to kill them all."  Bart and Lisa protest.

    Burns: But they're so wretchedly adorable. 25 little Rory
           Calhouns...I can't do it.  But I can kill you.
            [Lisa whimpers like a puppy]
           No, I can't kill you either.  Look at you, standing there on
           your hind legs like a couple of Rory Calhouns.
            [Lisa and Bart sigh]
     Lisa: Well, Mr. Burns, I hope you've realized the folly of killing
           innocent animals for fashion.
    Burns: [repentant] Oh, I have, I have!  I swear I will never wear
           any clothing made from an animal.  [to himself] That can do
           an amusing trick.
            [a long time later]
Announcer: Another victory for Montgomery Burns' champion greyhounds. 25
           dogs, 25 world champions which so far have earned their owner
           over ten million dollars.  I'll bet whoever gave him those
           dogs is kicking themselves now.
            [Marge walks down to the basement and sees Homer's shadow
           dangling]
    Marge: Homer!  For the love of God, no!
    Homer: [grunts] Marge, you know that batting this lightbulb is the
           only thing that cheers me up after giving away those million-
           dollar greyhounds.
-- Homer releases his aggression, "Two Dozen &amp; One Greyhounds"

Homer bats the bulb a couple more times; it breaks on his head, plunging
the room into darkness.  Homer falls heavily to the floor.

EPISODE SUMMARY: 
[Syndication cuts are marked in curly braces "{}" and are courtesy of
Frederic Briere.]

The Springfield Elementary School Bus is looking the worse for wear.
Its back bumper is loose and its muffler sparks as it drags along the
ground.  The children on the bus seem to be enjoying the bumpy ride, all
except for Wendell.

Milhouse: This bus has seen better days.
    Bart: Well, at least it's safer than the old bus.
           [shot of old bus, propped up on blocks]
           [a leaf from a tree falls on it; it explodes]
Milhouse: Uh oh, time to move: the hole's getting bigger.
           [they climb onto the seat in front as their seat falls
          through]
    Edna: Seymour, the children are playing in the hole again.
          Shouldn't you get that fixed?
 Skinner: Edna, you _know_ they just cut the school's budget.  If I had
          the money I'd fix the exhaust leak in the back.  Actually, I
          think it's causing some of our low test scores.
           [shot of the children in the back surrounded by smoke and
          drooling, except for Ralph Wiggum who looks normal]
-- One a Wiggum, always a Wiggum, 

The bus passes a sign for the Fort Springfield civil war site.  "All
right," says Skinner, "the battlefield is just a half-mile ahead.  Begin
braking procedure!"  The children take off their jackets and hold them
out the window so they fill with air and provide drag.

At the fort, a tour guide shows some students a cannon.

Guide: This civil war cannon had been fully restored and is in ready-to-
       fire condition.  But it's a good thing we're _not_ firing it
       because it happens to be aimed at the main support leg of that
       lookout tower.  People don't realize that these cannons are very
       sensitive, and the slightest jolt could set them off.
        [the bus from Springfield Elementary arrives and skids into the
       cannon, knocking one of its wheels off]
       Of course, for safety reasons, we don't keep the cannon loaded:
       it's just common sense.
-- A tour of Fort Springfield, 

Skinner gets out of the bus and approaches Otto.

Skinner: Otto, why don't you get some more gas?  Here's the "credit
         card".
          [hands him a length of siphoning pipe]
   Otto: [groaning] Oh...
Skinner: And a mint for afterwards.
-- Stupid afterwards mint!, 

At the ticket booth, Skinner can't believe what's happened.

Skinner: Five dollars a child?!  Last year it was free!
  Woman: Hmph, new ownership.  [points to sign]
          ["Diz-Nee Historical Park; Sorry, but there's profit to be
         had."]
Skinner: But we don't have that kind of money!  In fact, no school could
         afford the --
          [the brand new Shelbyville Elementary bus pulls up and
         disgorges its passengers]
Valiant: Here's the admission, plus, er, something for you.  See that
         they get a little extra education, would you?
  Woman: [bright] Yes sir, Principal Valiant!
Skinner: He thinks he's so hot ever since he swept the Princi Awards.
         Those things are rigged...
-- Second-rate Skinner, 

Part of the tour features a reenactment of a famous scene from the war.

Guide: On May 21, 1864, the men of the Ninth Bearded Infantry were
       sunning and fluffing their beards in the sun.  Suddenly, enemy
       troops crested that hill over there.
Man 1: Fort Springfield, we surrender unconditionally!
Man 2: We're sick.  We need leeches and hacksaws to saw off our
       gangrenous limbs!
Guide: But the Springfield Brigade was too brave to accept the
       surrender.
Man 3: Come on, boys!  Those white flags are no match for our muskets.
        [they charge]
Guide: And the Springfielders heroically slaughtered their enemies as
       they prayed for mercy.
        [the children watch the mayhem and cheer]
-- Violence sells, 

The children watching from the stands close by aren't from Springfield
Elementary; these latter children are behind a fence far away from the
battle scene.

   Bart: It's hard to see what's going on; I can only make out the fat
         soldiers.
Skinner: All right, children, switch.
          [one of the soldiers spots the children]
  Man 4: Hey, they're trying to learn for free!
  Guide: [sees them] Get 'em!
  Man 3: Use your phony guns as clubs!
Skinner: Run, children!
          [they take off, followed by the soldiers]
         Start the bus, Otto, start the bus!
          [Otto, siphoning, swallows some gasoline by accident and
         coughs]
   Otto: Damn!  I shouldn't have eaten the mint first.
          [starts the bus]
         OK, hop on!
          [the children, for the most part, do so]
   Uter: Wait, wait!
          [he stumbles; the soldiers catch up and surround him]
   Edna: Well, Seymour, because of your penny-pinching, we're coming
         back from a field trip with the fewest children yet.
Skinner: God bless the man who invented permission slips.
          [kisses an armful of them]
-- The field trip ends on a sour note, 

At lunch that day, Bart reads the note Marge wrote for him.

Bart: Uh, I think I got your lunch.
       [holds up note: "I am very proud of you, Love, Mom"]
Lisa: Oh yeah, I didn't think this was for me.
       [holds up note: "Be good.  For the love of God, _please_ be
      good."]
-- Bart and Lisa eat lunch, 

   Edna: Seymour, the teachers are fed up.  You have to start putting
         money back into the school.  You've cut back on everything:
         salaries, supplies, the food -- [takes a bite] -- I don't care
         what you say, I can taste the newspaper.
Skinner: Posh.  Shredded newspapers add much-needed ruffage and
         essential inks.  Besides, you didn't notice the old gym mats.
          [Lunch Lady Doris feeds some into a grinder]
         Doris: There's very little meat in these gym mats.
   Edna: Our demands are very reasonable.  By ignoring them, you're
         selling out these children's future!
Skinner: Oh, come on, Edna: we both know these children _have_ no
         future!
          [all the children stop and look at him]
          [chuckles nervously] Prove me wrong, kids.  Prove me wrong.
-- The Skinnerian challenge, 

Lisa doesn't like the sound of it.

Lisa: I've never seen them fight like that, Bart.  I'm worried that all
      this posturing and saber-rattling could lead to a teachers'
      strike.
Bart: [scheming] Strike, eh?  [cracks his knuckles; they snap painfully]
      Ouch!  My bones are so brittle.  But I always drink plenty of...
      [picks up milk carton, reads it] "Malk"?
-- Now with Vitamin R, 

Mrs. Krabappel continues to make her case.

   Edna: How do you expect us to teach with these supplies?  Well, this
         pointer's so old, it's worn down to a nub.
Skinner: [takes it] It still points, doesn't it?
   Edna: Stop that!  And look at this: the only books we have are ones
         that were banned by other schools.
Skinner: Well, the kids have to learn about "Tek War" sooner or later.
         [walks off]
-- Mmm, William Shatner, 

Bart appears at the door.

   Edna: Go away, Bart, this is not a good time.
   Bart: I saw you two fighting...I'm worried there could be a strike
         and the school would shut down.
   Edna: [scoffs] I'm sure you'd really hate that.  There's not going to
         be a strike, Bart.
   Bart: Yeah...Skinner says you wouldn't have the won tons to go
         through with it.
   Edna: Skinner said _that_?
   Bart: Well, I had to clean it up a little.
          [in Skinner's office]
         Basically, Krabappel said you'd give the teachers everything
         they want.
Skinner: She did?
   Bart: Yeah.  She said you'd fold faster than Superman on laundry day.
Skinner: We'll see about that.  Simpson, I always thought you were...
         sneaky and manipulative.  Now I see you're really a very
         sensitive little boy.
   Bart: Thank you, Sir.
Skinner: Aww...
-- Bart sows dissent, 

   Edna: Seymour, you're being _totally_ unfair and the teachers won't
         stand for it.
Skinner: You don't have the guts to strike.
   Edna: You don't have the guts to take us all on.
          [they start walking away from each other]
          [Bart pokes his head out of a locker and makes chicken noises]
          [they turn around and glare]
Skinner: That's it!
   Edna: Stee-rike!
          [over the PA, a struggle is heard]
Skinner: Attention, this is an emergency broadcast: all is well in the
         school.  My authority as principal is total --
          [more struggling is heard]
         Give me that!
   Edna: Attention, teachers: we're on strike.
          [the kids murmur amongst themselves]
   Lisa: Strike?
  Ralph: Miss Hoover, are you on st --
 Hoover: [skidding away in her car] Go home, children!
-- Sounds like a "yes", 

A little girl holds onto the rings in the gymnasium with no one below
her.  "Hello?  Mrs. Pommelhorst?  I'd like to get down now!" she calls
plaintively.

{In band practice, the children butcher "God Save the Queen."  Database
observes, "Hey, now that -- now that Largo's gone, we, we can play the
forbidden music."  The children break into a quite reasonable-sounding
version of "Pop Goes the Weasel".  Three quarters of the way through,
Largo pops his head in the door: "I heard that!"}

[End of Act One.  Time: 6:59]

The children burst out the school doors early, hooting and hollering.
At home, Marge dusts the sleeping pets.

 Marge: Bart, Lisa, what are you two doing home so early?
  Bart: Great news, Mom!
  Lisa: Horrible news, Mom!
  Bart: The school's on strike, maybe forever!  [gasps] Oh, overload,
        pleasure overload...[kisses SLH, runs off]
  Lisa: Luckily I've prepared for this, so I'm not too worried.
         [opens up "Strike Preparedness Kit", turns on tape recorder]
Hoover: [on tape] Sit up straight.  Eyes forward.  No talking.  Is that
        gum?  Is that gum?  Is that gum?
  Lisa: Oh, yeah.  Phew!
-- Drastic measures, 

Marge: Bart, leave that crowbar here.  You know I don't like you prying
       and jimmying.
-- Motherly chastisement, 

Milhouse runs into his parents' house.

  Milhouse: Mom!  Dad!  Great news!  The teachers are on --
Mrs. Van H: We heard.
 Mr. Van H: And we already hired a tutor.
     Tutor: Well, looks like we'll be staying late today to make up for
            all the dillydallying.
  Milhouse: [groaning] Oh...
-- 

Bart decides to hang out at a construction site.  "Awesome," he
breathes, then picks up a nearby megaphone.

   Bart: You, with the crane!  Spin around real fast!
          [crane operator shrugs, then does so]
         Now you!  Dump three tons of sand onto that Porta-potty.
          [a man enters the Porta-potty as it gets covered]
          [the foreman walks up and grabs the megaphone]
Foreman: [with Bart's voice] Hey!  Can't you tell my voice from a ten-
         year-old kid's?  [sighs] Ay, carumba!
-- The joy of power, 

There's a huge lineup at the arcade.  The entrance is cordoned off; a
bouncer shakes each child and only lets in the ones who jingle.  At the
park, Bart plays chess.  "Hey," observes one man, "that little boy is
playing three games at once!"  All three opponents announce "Checkmate!"
in quick succession.

Homer rues the teachers' strategy at dinner.

Homer: Lousy teachers, trying to palm off our kids on us!
 Lisa: But, Dad, by striking, they're trying to effect a change in
       management so that they can be happier and more productive.
Homer: Lisa, if you don't like your job, you don't strike: you just go
       in every day and do it really half-assed.  That's the American
       way.
-- Homer tells it like it is, 

 Lisa: I've got some textbooks but without state-approved syllabi and
       standardized testing my education can only go so far.
Marge: Honey, maybe you should relax a little.
 Lisa: Relax?  I can't relax!  Nor can I yield, relent, or -- [groans]
       Only two synonyms?  Oh my God: I'm losing my perspicacity!
        [runs off screaming]
Homer: Well, it's always in the last place you look.
-- Tautologies, 

The teachers picket outside the school, holding placards reading "2+2, a
raise is due", "A is for apple, B is for raise", and "Gimme!  Gimme!
Gimme!"  Lisa twists Miss Hoover's arm: "So if we were in school this
week, what do you think we'd be learning?" but Miss Hoover shuns her.

   Edna: Good news, people!
          [the other teachers cheer]
         I'm happy to announce that another union has joined us in a
         sympathy strike: the piano tuners' Local 412!
          [the teachers look at one another, confused]
          [a piano tuner stands outside a house with an out-of-tune
         piano and looks smug]
   Bart: [walking up] Now for Operation Strike-Make-Go-Longer.
          [to teacher] You know, I heard Skinner say the teachers will
         crack any minute.
          [the teachers whisper it forward through the line]
Teacher: [to Edna] Skinner said the teachers will crack any minute
         purple monkey dishwasher.
   Edna: Well!  We'll show him, especially for that "purple monkey
         dishwasher" remark.
          [everyone shouts their assent]
-- Rabble rousing, 

Superintendent Chalmers berates Skinner.  "Seymour, you are truly
incompetent."  Despite Skinner's protests, Chalmers barrels on: "Listen
to those passing motorists who support the teachers."  Outside, Edna
holds up a "Honk if you love cookies" sign.

Meanwhile, Milhouse continues to learn.

   Tutor: Fifteen minute recess, Milhouse.  The recess assignment is
          chapter three through seven.
Milhouse: Yay!  Recess!  [tears outside]
    Bart: Milhouse!  I found a hive of killer bees.  You wanna go throw
          rocks at it?
Milhouse: Sorry, Bart, I'm deeply immersed in the Teapot Dome scandal.
    Bart: Huh?
Milhouse: However, it might be feasible in a fortnight.
    Bart: Wha?
Milhouse: I can play in two weeks.
    Bart: Juh?
-- Bart, master of the monosyllable, 

Jimbo watches TV with his mother and weeps.  "I just can't believe Stark
would stoop to that right in the middle of Montana and Dakota's
wedding."  {At the arcade, Dolph and Kearney play two video games at
once.  "All this free time...I never thought I'd get sick of `Razor
Fight II: The Slashening'," says Dolph.  "I probably should stop," sighs
Kearney, "my doctor says I have the wrists of an 80- year-old."}

Bart creates havoc at a bank, calling out "What do you mean, the bank is
out of money?", "Insolvent?!", and "You only have enough cash for the
next three customers?"  Everyone panics and rushes the glass, demanding
an explanation.  A Jimmy Stewart-like bank manager stammers, "I don't
have your money here.  It's at Bill's house and Fred's house!"  A fight
breaks out.

Lisa continues to freak out at home.

Lisa: [panting] Grade me...look at me...evaluate and rank me!  Oh, I'm
      good, good, good, and oh so smart!  Grade me!
       [Marge scribbles an A on a piece of paper]
       [Lisa walks off, muttering crazily and sighing]
-- 

That night, in bed...

Marge: I'm worried about the kids, Homey.  Lisa's becoming very
       obsessive.  This morning I caught her trying to dissect her own
       raincoat.
Homer: [scoffs] I know.  And this perpetual motion machine she made
       today is a joke!  It just keeps going faster and faster.
Marge: And Bart isn't doing very well either.  He needs boundaries and
       structure.  There's something about flying a kite at night that's
       so unwholesome.  [looks out window]
 Bart: [creepy voice] Hello, Mother dear.
Marge: [closing the curtains] That's it: we have to get them back to
       school.
Homer: I'm with you, Marge.  Lisa!  Get in here.
        [Lisa walks in, chuckling nervously]
       In this house, we obey the laws of thermodynamics!
-- The last straw, 

In the Springfield Elementary Auditorium, Ned Flanders stands at a
podium with Skinner and Edna on either side of him.

     Ned: Well, all right, I'd like to call this meeting of the PTA to
          or-diddely-order.  Let's see if we can't put an end to this
          strike fuss, huh?  Mrs. Krabappel, why don't you begin?
 Skinner: Boo!
    Edna: Oh, "boo" yourself.  Our demands are simple: a small cost-of-
          living increase and some better equipment and supplies for
          your children.
Audience: Yeah!  Give it to them! etc.
 Skinner: Yeah, in a dream world.  We have a very tight budget; to do
          what she's asking, we'd have to raise taxes.
Audience: Raise taxes?  They're too high as they are.  Taxes are bad.
          etc.
    Edna: It's your children's future.
Audience: That's right.  Children are important. etc.
 Skinner: It'll cost you.
Audience: No to taxes.  My God, they're going to raise taxes. etc.
    Edna: C'mon!
Audience: She makes a good case.  Good point. etc.
 Skinner: [rubs his fingertips together]
Audience: More taxes?  The finger thing means the taxes. etc.
     Ned: Well, I guess this is a case where we'll have to agree to
          disagree.
 Skinner: I don't agree to that.
    Edna: Neither do I!
-- So much for being conciliatory, 

Ned: Ho, ho, this is a dilly of a pickle.
Man: Oh my God...the PTA has disbanded!  [jumps out a window]
Ned: No, no!  The PTA has not disbanded.
      [the man reverses his path through the window and sits down]
     We do have an emergency plan in case of a prolonged strike right
     here.
      [opens a briefcase]
     Let's see..."Replace teachers with super-intelligent cyborgs.  Or,
     if cyborgs aren't invented yet, use people from the neighborhood."
-- Long-term planning by the PTA, 

Jasper takes over Lisa's class.

Jasper: Talking out of turn...that's a paddling.  Looking out the
        window...that's a paddling.  Staring at my sandals...that's a
        paddling.  Paddling the school canoe...ooh, you better believe
        that's a paddling.
  Lisa: [groaning] Oh...
-- Lisa's substitute, 

Professor Frink takes over the kindergarten class, drawing equations and
free-body diagrams on the blackboard to explain the workings of one of
those things that kids push which makes the balls pop.

Frink: N'hey hey!  Ahem, n'hey, so the compression and expansion of the
       longitudinal waves cause the erratic oscillation -- you can see
       it there -- of the neighboring particles.
        [a girl raises her hand]
        [sighs] Yes, what is it?  What?  What is it?
 Girl: Can I play with it?
Frink: No, you can't play with it; you won't enjoy it on as many levels
       as I do.
        [he chuckles as he plays with it] The colors, children!
-- Professor Frink explains the physics of a toy, 

Moe takes over Bart's class.

     Moe: OK, when I call your name, uh, you say "present" or "here".
          Er, no, say "present".  Ahem, Anita Bath?
           [everyone laughs]
          All right, settle down.  Anita Bath here?
           [everyone laughs]
          All right, fine, fine.  Maya Buttreeks.
           [everyone laughs]
          Hey, what are you laughing at?  What?  Oh, oh: I get it, I get
          it.  It's my big ears, isn't it, kids?  Isn't it?  Well
          children, I can't help that!  [runs out crying]
    Bart: [sighing] Ah...
           [crosses Moe's name off list of substitute teachers]
Milhouse: Wow, Bart, I'm impressed the way you knocked off all those
          substitutes.
    Bart: In my weaker moments, I almost pity them.  Then I just remind
          myself, they're trying to teach.
-- Nefarious Bart, 

Skinner walks in.

Skinner: Well, children, I don't know what you did to all those
         substitutes, but it's going to stop now.  Leopold?
Leopold: [bursting in] All right, you listen up, you little _freaks_.
         The fun stops here: you're going to shut your stinking traps
         and behave, dammit!  This is one substitute you're not going to
         screw with!
          [Martin and Wendell swallow uncomfortably]
         Marge Simpson!  [she walks in]
          [Bart swallows uncomfortably]
  Marge: Hi, class!  Hi Bart...over here, sweetie.  It's me, Mom.  Hi!
         Hey!  Hello?
   Bart: [groaning] Ohh...
-- No groaning in my class, 

[End of Act Two.  Time: 16:30]

   Marge: Well, I'm sure some of you already know me.  I'm Bart
          Simpson's mother.
           [everyone laughs; Nelson pushes Bart]
           [Marge goes up to Bart and starts wiping dirt off his cheek]
    Bart: Mom!
Milhouse: Hey, Bart!  What about the booby trap?
           [Bart gasps, runs up to the front, removes tack from chair]
    Bart: May I?  [pulls out her chair]
   Marge: Thank you.
Everyone: Teacher's pet!  Momma's boy! etc.
Milhouse: I meant the other booby trap!
           [Bart gasps, dives for Marge, pushes her out of the way]
           [a huge log crashes into the blackboard]
   Marge: Oh, kids have been doing that one since my day.
-- The youth of yesteryear, 

The Simpsons eat dinner that night.

Homer: [expansive] So, how was everybody's day at school?
 Bart: Horrifying!
 Lisa: Pointless!
Marge: Exhausting.  It took the children forty minutes to locate Canada
       on the map.
Homer: Marge, anyone can miss Canada, all tucked away down there.
 Lisa: Well, _my_ teacher's a nightmare.  Three kids got sick from
       inhaling his ointment fumes, he confiscated everything made of
       tin, and then he sent us home early because he got his beard
       caught in the pencil sharpener.
        [at school, Abe tries to help Jasper get out of it]
        [Abe turns the crank; Jasper gets pulled in a bit]
  Abe: Oh!  Oh, um, OK, um, hmm...um, here.
        [turns it some more; Jasper gets pulled in more]
       D'oh!  OK, uh, OK, let's see, um...what if I did this?
        [turns it some more; Jasper gets pulled in more]
       Um...you're on your own.  [runs off]
 Lisa: There's no way I'll get into an ivy league school now.  At this
       rate I probably won't even get into Vassar.
Homer: I've had just about enough of your Vassar-bashing, young lady!
-- Homer, defender of the faith, 

 Bart: Look, Mom, it feels really weird having you on my turf.  How
       would you feel if I started mopping the floor?
Marge: I'd be thrilled.  You can start right now.
 Bart: [angry] Oh!
Marge: And I'm going to keep teaching your class, like it or lump it.
 Bart: Well, then, I guess I'll just have to get into the crawlspace
       again.  [runs off]
Marge: I hate it when he gets in there.
        [pounds the wall with a broom]
-- 

Next day, Marge supervises recess.  Bart hides behind a tree.

   Bart: Psst!  Over here.
  Marge: Huh?
   Bart: Mom, I need a dollar.  Ever since you started teaching here
         kids have been taking my lunch money, and I need that money for
         candy.
  Marge: Mmm, here you go precious.  Now, go off with your friends.
          [pushes him towards Jimbo, Dolph, and Nelson]
  Jimbo: "Here you go, precious."
          [they start beating him up]
   Bart: Why isn't my mom stopping this?
  Jimbo: We created a diversion.
  Marge: That's a very nice jig, Kearney.  Now isn't dancing much more
         fun than bullying?
Kearney: [chuckles] Yeah.
-- Kearney the sissy, 

Bart picks himself up woozily.

    Bart: That's it, I can't take this any more, Milhouse.  I've got to
          get the real teachers back.
Milhouse: Bart, you'll never get Krabappel and Skinner together again.
          They're like two positively charged ions.
    Bart: Zuh?  Wait!  That's it!  With your booksmarts, and my ability
          to exploit people with booksmarts, we can figure out a clever
          plan to get them back together!
           [later]
    Edna: A surprise party for _me_?  In Principal Skinner's office?
          Well, I don't know, but...all right.
 Skinner: Me?  Go to my office?  Well, it's highly irregular, but all
          right.
           [Bart padlocks them into the office]
    Bart: And you're not coming out until you reach an agreement!
-- The clever plan, 

The two trapped teachers pound on the door, threatening Bart.  "Don't
worry, they'll start negotiating," says Bart, but as the clock turns
forward from 11:00 to 3:00, the pounding continues.  It stops briefly at
5:00, only to resume.

Eventually, they're too tired to keep pounding.

   Edna: Well, Seymour, I guess we could start talking.
Skinner: What's the point?  There's no more money, unless you've got
         some magic new source of revenue.
   Edna: Well, we've _got_ to think something up.  They've got us locked
         in here like prisoners.
Skinner: Prisoners in our own school...hey!
          [they gasp at one another]
-- A plan begins to form, 

So they turn the school into Springfield Elementary School and Prison,
with fences and guard towers.

Skinner: This is a great way to make extra money, renting out our
         cloakrooms to our overcrowded prison system.
  Snake: Yo, I used to sit right over there.
          [the other prisoner snatches a piece of Martin's shirt]
          [he moves his desk quickly away]
   Edna: It's all right, children, just ignore the murderer.
Skinner: And, as a bonus, some of our more troublesome students might be
         scared straight.
  Snake: Psst!  Kid, help me break out of here.  I'll _totally_ make it
         worth your while.
   Bart: [smiling] I'm listening...
-- Or scared crooked, whatever, 

[End of Act Three.  Time: 20:54]
 EPISODE TITLE: 'Round Springfield


EPISODE SUMMARY: 
(There are no syndication cuts in this episode, according to Frederic
Briere.)

It's the Krusty show.

Krusty: Hey, kids!  It's story time.  [laughs] I'm going to tell you the
        story of Krusty's expensive new suit: his sexual harassment
        suit.  [laughs painfully] Boy.
        Anyway, as part of Krusty's plea bargain, he has a new court-
        ordered sidekick, Ms.  No-Means-No.
         [to her] Whoa!  You're hot.  Let's get some dinner after the
        show.
         [she blows a whistle and holds up a stop sign with "NO" on it]
        I have dinner with all my employees, right, Sideshow Mel?
   Mel: We've never spoken outside of work.
Krusty: [laughs, then sighs] Oh...
  Bart: [watching] I'm surprised he doesn't try to blame his problems on
        his Percodan addiction.
Krusty: It wasn't my fault, it was the Percodan.  If you ask me, that
        stuff rots your brain.  And now a word from our new sponsor...
        Percodan?!  Aw, crap!
-- Negative endorsements, 

Marge disapproves of Bart watching TV at breakfast.

Marge: Bart, are you ready for your history test?
 Bart: Oh, you bet, Mom!  Ask me anything.
Marge: OK.  Who was George Washington Carver?
 Bart: Um...the guy who chopped up George Washington?
Homer: Really?  Wow.
-- A learning experience for everyone, 

Bart takes a spoonful of Krusty O's -- unfortunately, the one that
contains the free jagged metal Krusty O -- and eats it.  After
swallowing, he grimaces.

Marge: Bart, you said you were going to study.
 Bart: [clearly in pain] Oh!  My stomach.
Marge: Mmm, you just don't want to take that test.
 Bart: No, I mean it: it really hurts.
 Lisa: Mom, I think he's serious.
Homer: Kids are so naive.  Lisa, when you get to be our age, you'll
       learn a few things, like when a sign says "Do not feed the
       bears," man, you better not feed the bears.  Now get to school,
       boy.
        [Bart walks off groaning with Lisa]
-- Sign, sign, everywhere a sign, 

At school, Bart's condition is no better.

    Bart: Mrs. Krabappel, I can't take the test.  I have a stomach ache.
    Edna: Well, that's a lame excuse for an excuse.  Hah!
    Bart: Look, if you ignore me and I die, you'll get in a _lot_ of
          trouble.
    Edna: Read page six of the school charter.  [hands him one]
    Bart: "No teacher shall be held accountable if Bart Simpson dies."
    Edna: We're also absolved if Milhouse gets eaten by the school
          snake.
Milhouse: [inside the snake] Hey, cool!  There's a rabbit in here.
-- Mmm, absolution, 

A little later, Bart puts his hand up.

 Bart: Mrs. Krabappel, I'm done failing the test.  Can I _please_ go to
       the nurse?
 Edna: Gosh, Bart, maybe you really are in pain.  Well...it would be
       cruel not to let you go.
        [files her nails, hums the national anthem]
        [hums part of "Stars and Stripes Forever"]
       Heh heh heh, _now_ you may go.
 Bart: [walking into nurse's room] Lunch Lady Doris?  Why are you here?
Doris: Budget cuts.  They've even got Groundskeeper Willy teaching
       French.
Willy: "Bonjourrr", you cheese-eating surrender monkeys!
-- The finer points of language, 

    Bart: Look, my stomach really hurts.
   Doris: All I can give you are these chewable Prozac for kids.  Your
          choice: Manic Depressive Mouse, or the Bluebird of
          Unhappiness.
    Bart: [groaning] Oh...[collapses]
 Skinner: Superintendent Chalmers, I'd like you to meet our new school
          nurse, Lunch Lady Doris.
Chalmers: Yeah, nice to see you.  Seymour, why is that student lying
          unconscious on the floor?
 Skinner: Well in many cases, the floor is the best -- ahem.  Oh, look,
          here comes Lumpy, the school snake!
           [Milhouse, Ralph, and Lewis cry for help from inside it]
          Oh, Lord...
-- No promotions today, 

Bart gets taken to the Springfield General Hospital.  In an operating
theater, Dr. Hibbert reassures him.

Hibbert: Don't worry, son: you'll be fine.  This boy's appendix is
         inflamed and about to burst, which _will_ make it easier to
         find once I get in there.  [chuckles]
  Homer: [watching from above] Man, these are primo seats.  I could
         _really_ go for a hot dog.
  Marge: Homer!  This is an operation.
    Man: Hot dogs, get your hot dogs here!
  Homer: Woo hoo!
   Nick: OK, Bart, I will count to three, and you will be sound asleep.
         One, two, three...out like a light!
Hibbert: Scalpel...?
   Bart: [screaming] Aah!
   Nick: Whoopsie, heh.  Maybe if I fiddle with these knobs.  [sniffs]
         Hey, I smell gas...pleasant gas.  [sighs] Night-night gas...
         [collapses]
-- He forgot to say "Hi, everybody!", 

Bart awakens woozily, his vision blurred.

  Marge: How's my special little guy?
   Lisa: How're you feeling, big brother?
          [Maggie sucks on her pacifier]
  Homer: Aw, this is wonderful: you're alive!
   Bart: [resentful] No thanks to _you_, Homer.
  Homer: Why you little...!
          [strangles Bart for a while]
Hibbert: Now Homer, please, the boy's just had a very serious operation.
  Homer: [sullen] All right.
-- Dr. Hibbert, voice of authority, 

Bart's class comes in to visit him.

 Hibbert: Bart, I found the culprit: a jagged metal cereal O.
    Bart: Wicked!  [pulls up his gown] I got this cool scar, _and_ I get
          to miss a week of school!
           [his assembled classmates ooh and aah]
Milhouse: Dr. Hibbert, can I have _my_ appendix out?
           [the other children clamor in agreement]
 Hibbert: [chuckles] Why not?  Follow me, kids!  Nurse, prep these
          children!
           [the children follow, chattering eagerly]
-- Hippocrates, schmippocrates, 

Lisa says "I'm glad you're OK, Bart," kisses him on the cheek, and walks
out down the hall.  She hears a saxophone playing and stops.  Eventually
she spies the cause.

Lisa: Bleeding Gums Murphy!
  BG: Little Lisa.  It's good to see you again.
Lisa: It's been a long time...
       [flashback to 7G06, BG playing on the bridge]
  BG: My friends call me "Bleeding Gums".
Lisa: Ew.  How did you get a name like that?
  BG: Well, let me put it this way: you ever been to the dentist?
Lisa: Yep.
  BG: Not me.  I suppose I should go to one, but I got enough pain in my
      life as it is.
       [back to the present]
  BG: What are _you_ here for?
Lisa: My brother just had his appendix out.
  BG: Is he going to be OK?
Bart: [mooning them] Hello, I'm Dr. Cheeks.  I'm doing my rounds, and,
      uh, I'm a little behind.
Lisa: [monotone] He'll be fine...
-- Bart bounces backside -- er, back, 

[End of Act One.  Time: 5:36]

     BG: Lisa, I sure am glad you dropped by.  You're the first visitor
         I've had.
   Lisa: What about your family?
     BG: I don't really have a family.  All I had was a little brother
         who grew up to become a doctor.  He used to laugh at the most
         inappropriate times.
Hibbert: [chuckling] Hey, I've got an older brother that I'll never see.
         He's a jazz musician or some such.  Oh well, bye bye.  [walks
         out]
   Lisa: It must be awful to be all alone in the world.
     BG: Well, I always had my music.  I learned at the feet of Blind
         Willie Witherspoon.
          [flash to younger BG in a bar]
 Willie: I've been playing jazz for thirty years and I just can't make a
         go of it.  I want you to have my saxophone.
     BG: This isn't a saxophone, it's an umbrella!
 Willie: So I've been playing a umbrella for thirty years?  Why didn't
         anybody tell me?
     BG: Heh, we all thought it was funny.  [chuckles]
 Willie: That's not funny.
-- Differing senses of humor, 

The scene returns to the present.

   BG: Then I got my big break: I was on Steve Allen's "Tonight Show".
        [flash to Steve Allen on stage and audience clapping]
Allen: Heh heh heh.  Now, a brilliant jazz musician who's inspired me to
       do some improv poetry.  [chuckles]
       Twinkle, twinkle, groovy cat, [BG starts playing]
       How I wonder where you at.
       I really love the way you cook,
       Just like me when I wrote this book.
        [holds it up] "How to Make Love to Steve Allen", from the author
       of "Happiness Is a Naked Steve Allen", "Journey to the Center of
       Steve Allen", and "The Joy of Cooking Steve Allen".
-- Jack Paar ain't got nothing on him, 

   BG: I cut my first and only album, "Sax on the Beach", but then I
       spent all my money on my $1,500 a day habit.
        [flashback]
       I'd like another Fabrege egg, please?
  Man: Sir, don't you think you've had enough?
   BG: I'll tell you when I've had enough!
        [back to the present]
 Lisa: When was the last time you worked?
   BG: In '86 when I did I guest shot on the Cosby Show.
        [flashback]
Cosby: Hey, kids!  Meet Grampa Murphy.
Child: We have three grampas already!
Cosby: This one's a great jazz musician.
Child: Oh, they _all_ are.
Cosby: Oh, oh: you see, the kids, they listen to the rap music which
       gives them the brain damage.  With their hippin', and the
       hoppin', and the bippin', and the boppin', so they don't know
       what the jazz...is all about!  You see, jazz is like the Jello
       Pudding Pop -- no, actually, it's more like Kodak film -- no,
       actually, jazz is like the New Coke: it'll be around forever, heh
       heh heh.
-- New commercial lows, 

Lisa is impressed.

Lisa: Wow, you've had some career, although the moral seems to be that a
      lifetime of jazz leaves you sad and lonely.
  BG: Well, before you came to visit, I would have agreed with you.
-- Aw, 

Kent Brockman delivers the news.

  Kent: This just in: Krusty the Klown staged a press conference today
        to defend himself against charges that his products are unsafe,
        his theme park is a death trap, and that he's marketing videos
        of Tanya Harding's wedding night.
Krusty: And I contend that those tourists were decapitated _before_ they
        entered the KrustyLand House of Knives[tm].  Next question?
 Woman: What about that little boy who got appendicitis from eating your
        cereal?
         [shot of Bart with Lionel Hutz]
Krusty: To prove that this metal O is harmless, I will personally eat
        one.  [takes a mouthful]
        See?  There's nothing -- [starts screaming and writhing] Oh,
        boy!  This thing is shredding my insides.
   Mel: Er, Krusty, that wasn't the metal one, that was a regular Krusty
        O.
Krusty: It's poison!
-- Not much of a vote of confidence, 

Back at the hospital...

    BG: So, you all set for your recital?
  Lisa: I sure am!  Look: [shows her gums] I stopped brushing my teeth
        so I can play just like you.
    BG: Aw.  Lisa, honey, music comes from what's in your heart, not
        what's on your teeth.  Come on, let's jam.
         [he starts to play; Lisa sings]
  Lisa: Lift me, won't you lift me above the old routine?
        Make it nice, play it clean, Jazzman!
         [she plays with him]
         [people in the hospital hear and start to dance]
        When the Jazzman's testifyin', a faithless man believes.
         [a man's heart monitor displays musical notes]
        He can sing you into paradise, or bring you to your knees.
         [people dance and snap their fingers]
         [Hibbert stitches "I (heart) JAZZ" onto a patient's stomach]
        Jazzman, oh, Jazzman!
         [they jam some more]
         [Barney walks out of the Detox center into the Retox center]
Barney: Hey Moe, what'll you give me for an A. A. Chip?
   Moe: Uh, Barney, this is a five minute chip.  Ehh, it's worth a
        Pabst.  [draws him one]
-- Moe, just making his living, 

The song ends and BG hugs Lisa.  "Baby, you are going to knock 'em
dead," he says, then coughs.  "Here," he says, holding out his
saxophone, "take this for luck."  Lisa gasps, "Your sax!  Thank you so
much."  He waves to her as she walks out.

At the sold out school recital, Principal Skinner introduces the
orchestra.

 Skinner: Now I have learned that most of the orchestra is having their
          appendixes removed, so without further ado, I give you the
          remnants of the Springfield Elementary School Orchestra: on
          saxophone, Lisa Simpson, on triangle, Martin Prince, and with
          a flute up his nose, Ralph Wiggum.
           [Ralph blows a couple of notes]
  Wiggum: That's some nice flutin', boy.
 Skinner: They will be playing "Stars and Stripes Forever", hopefully
          not forever.
           [they start playing]
Audience: Boo!
     Abe: It sucks!
           [Lisa jazzes it up a bit; everyone applauds]
           [back at the hospital]
    Lisa: Hey, Bleeding Gums!  I was great, and I owe it all to --
           [a nurse fixes his bed]
           [gasp] What happened to Mr. Murphy?
   Nurse: I'm sorry.  He passed away.
-- Like sands through an hourglass, 

Lisa goes to the bridge to cry.  At home, she weeps into her pillow when
Homer walks in.

Homer: Lisa, honey, are you going to be OK?
 Lisa: Bleeding Gums was my hero and I never got to tell him how I felt.
Homer: Oh, I'm sure he knew, and I'm sure that wherever he is now, he's
       happy.
 Lisa: But he was the only person that had the same love for music that
       I do.
        [Maggie gives Lisa a pacifier]
       Thank you.  Oh, Dad, why did he have to die?
Homer: Well, it's like the time that your cat Snowball got run over.
 Lisa: Uh huh.
Homer: Remember, honey?
 Lisa: Yeah.
Homer: What I'm saying is, all we have to do is go down to the pound and
       get a new jazzman.
 Lisa: [wailing] Oh, Dad!  [weeps]
Homer: Oh, I blew it again.
        [Maggie gives him a pacifier]
       What?  [sucks on it] Mmm...
-- Homer, competent parent, 

Lisa goes to the treehouse to be alone.  Bart joins her.

   Bart: Hey, Lis, you still upset about that jazz guy?
   Lisa: [noticing Bart] Oh.
   Bart: If it helps, I believe that after you die, you come back as
         whatever you want.  I'll be a butterfly.
   Lisa: How come?
   Bart: Because, nobody _ever_ suspects the butterfly.  [laughs]
          [flash to a smouldering school]
Skinner: [being restrained] I didn't burn down the school.  It was the
         butterfly, I tell you, the butterfly!
 Wiggum: He's crazy, boys.  Get the taser.
          [a small Bart butterfly holds a gas can and laughs]
-- The ultimate reincarnation fantasy, 

Lisa: Uh, maybe I need to talk to somebody with a little more age and
      wisdom.
 Abe: Death stalks you at every turn!
Lisa: Grampa!
 Abe: Well, it does -- aah!  Death!  There it is.  Death!
Lisa: It's only Maggie.
 Abe: [laughs sheepishly] Oh, yeah.  You know, at my age, the mind
      starts playing tricks.  So -- aah!  Death!
Lisa: That's only the cat.
 Abe: Oh.  Aah!  Death!
Lisa: That's Maggie again, Grampa.
 Abe: Oh.  Where were we?  Death!
-- Tricks indeed, 

At a meal, everyone but Lisa eats.

 Lisa: How come it won't stop hurting?
Marge: Oh, Lisa, it's normal to be sad when a friend dies, and Bleeding
       Gums was a good friend to you.  But nobody is really gone as long
       as we remember them.
Homer: Lisa, honey, if you really want to preserve his memory, I
       recommend getting a tattoo.  It preserves the things you love.
        [pulls up his sleeve]
       "Starland Vocal Band"?!  They suck!
  Abe: [pointing to the birdbath] Death!
-- Here, there, and everywhere, 

It's raining the day of BG's burial.  Lisa and Rev. Lovejoy are the only
two at the funeral.

   Lisa: Isn't anybody going to show up?
Lovejoy: Well, Lisa, we've waited an hour.  [clears his throat, reads]
         Dearly Beloved, we are gathered here today to bid farewell to
         Blood and Guts Murphy.
   Lisa: No!  It was Bleeding Gums Murphy.
Lovejoy: Yecch!  Anyway, Bloody Gums Murphy was quite the sousaphone
         player --
   Lisa: Saxophone!  He was a jazz musician.  You didn't know him --
         nobody knew him, but he was a great man, and I won't rest until
         all of Springfield knows the name Bleeding Gums Murphy!
  Homer: And I won't rest until I've gotten a hot dog.
  Marge: Homer, this is a cemetery.
    Man: Hot dogs!  Get your hot dogs here.
  Homer: Woo hoo!  [buys one]
  Marge: What do you do, follow my husband around?
    Man: Lady, he's putting my kids through college.
-- 

[End of Act Two.  Time: 14:51]

The doorbell rings and Bart answers it.

[End of Act Three.  Time: 20:08]

Hutz: Good news, Bart: the Krusty O Cereal Corp. has settled your case
      for $100,000, less, of course, my legal fees.
Bart: [suspicious] What kind of legal fees?
Hutz: [looking nervous] Well, for a case this complex, I had to assmeble
      a crack team of lawyers: Ronald Shaporo, trial attorney, Albert
      Dershman, who can hold three billiard balls in his mouth.
Bart: How much of the hundred thou do I get?
       [Hutz hands him a check]
      $500?!
Hutz: Yes, well, er --
Bart: Cool!
Hutz: Let's roll.
       [they speed off in a white pickup truck]
-- With license plate "NOT OJ", 

Bart: I can't believe it: five hundred bucks!  Oh, just think what I can
      do with that money.
       [flash to a casino, with women all around]
      $500 on red.
       [the man spins the roulette wheel]
 Man: The winner is black.  [takes all the chips]
       [back to the present]
Bart: Cool!
-- He could buy five Radioactive Man #1s, 

 Lisa: Mom, I want to honor Bleeding Gums' memory but I don't know where
       to start.
Marge: Maybe you could get the local jazz station to do a tribute to
       him, huh?
Homer: Jazz, pfft.  They just make it up as they go along.  I could do
       that: dee dee-dee dee dee dee dee, dee dee dee --
Marge: That's "Mary Had a Little Lamb".
Homer: OK, then, this: doo doo-doo doo doo doo doo, doo doo doo --
Marge: That's the same thing; you just replaced "dee"s with "doo"s.
Homer: D'oh!
-- So much for his B Sharps talent, 

Lisa approaches the DJ at KJAZZ ("152 Americans Can't Be Wrong").

Lisa: Hi, I have a request.  I would like you to do a tribute to
      Bleeding Gums Murphy, please.
  DJ: Aw, I'd love to, little sister, but we don't have his album.
Lisa: What if I could find it?
  DJ: Well, I'd spin it for you, but you know, ain't no one going to
      hear it.  Our broadcast range is only 23 feet which makes us the
      most powerful jazz station in the entire US of A.
Lisa: Gee, your station has a lot of problems.
  DJ: Tell me about it: just look at our morning guy.
Hans: Hello.  This is Moleman in the morning.  Good Moleman to you.
      Today, part four of our series of the agonizing pain in which I
      live every day...
-- He's only 31, 

Lisa heads to the comic book store.

 Lisa: $250?  But I need that album to honor the memory of Bleeding Gums
       Murphy.
Owner: He's dead?  Well why didn't you say so?
        [changes price to $500]
 Lisa: [groaning] Ohh...
-- Market value, 

"But where am I going to get $500?"  Lisa wonders.  She gasps as she
sees a bundle of money in the gutter.  She chases it, but it gets pulled
along on a string...by Burns, who hops in a car driven by Smithers and
speeds off just as Lisa gets close.

Bart walks into the comic store.

 Bart: Excuse me, my good man, I have $500 to blow.  What have you got?
Owner: Behold, the ultimate pog!
        [motions to Steve Allen album]
 Bart: I'll take it!
-- Steve Allen memorabilia, 

Bart sees Lisa walking downcast past the window of the store.  He wavers
between the Steve Allen album and the BG Murphy album.

Later, as Lisa sits on her bed, Bart walks in.

Bart: Lisa...look what I've got.  Ta da!  [shows BG album]
Lisa: [gasps] Bart, I can't believe it!  But why?
Bart: When I said my stomach hurt, you were the only one who believed
      me.
Lisa: Oh, thank you.  But $500?  You'll never see that much money again.
Bart: Oh yeah?  Take a look at this.
       [holds up "Krusty O's: Flesh-eating Bacteria in Every Box!"]
-- Lucien Bouchard's downfall, 

Lisa returns to KJAZZ with the album, and the DJ puts it on a turntable
and hands her a radio.  "Here, you can listen to it on this," he says,
but as she walks away from the station, all she picks up is static.  She
sighs heavily, "I did the best I could, Bleeding Gums."  Just then, a
large cloud appears over the radio tower and lightning strikes it.
Suddenly, the signal comes in clearly -- for Lisa, Homer at home, Abe at
the Castle, and Wiggum in his patrol car.  "Attention all units,
attention all units, poison gas cloud heading for --" announces the
dispatcher, but her voice is cut off by the jazz transmission.  Wiggum
approves until he passes out from a cloud of poison gas.

            Lisa: That was for you, Bleeding Gums.
              BG: [appearing in the cloud] You've made an old jazzman
                  happy, Lisa.
          Mufasa: [appearing in the cloud] You must avenge my death,
                  Kimba -- I mean, Simba.
     Darth Vader: [appearing in the cloud] Luke, I am your father.
James Earl Jones: [appearing in the cloud] This is CNN.
              BG: Will you guys pipe down?  I'm saying goodbye to Lisa!
             All: We're sorry.  [they vanish]
-- A last request, 

Lisa: I don't want you to go.
  BG: Sorry, but I have to.  Goodbye.
Lisa: [sobbing] Goodbye...
       [BG disappears, then reappears]
  BG: Oh, what the heck: once more from the top.
Lisa: Yay!
       ["Jazzman" starts again; Lisa sings]
      When the Jazzman's testifyin', a faithless man believes.
      He can sing you into paradise, or bring you to your knees.
-- The credits roll, 

[End of Act Three.  Time: 20:08]

Lisa keeps singing over the credits:

"Jazzman, take my blues away,
Make my pain the same as yours with every change you play.
Jazzman, oh, Jazzman."

She cries, "Once more time!" at the end, but BG protests, "Oh, come on,

 EPISODE TITLE: The Springfield Connection


EPISODE SUMMARY: 
[Syndication cuts are marked in curly braces "{}" and are courtesy of
Frederic Briere.]

It's an evening at the Springfield Pops at Jebediah Springfield Park
(sandwiched in between medfly sprayings).  Homer and Marge watch the
orchestra from atop a hill on a blanket on the grass.

  Marge: Aren't you glad we got out of the house and came downtown for a
         little culture?
  Homer: Peh.  They're butchering the classics.  Could that bassoon have
         come in any more late?
  Marge: Aw, come on, Homer, there's lasers.  You like lasers...
  Homer: Laser effects, mirrored balls...John Williams must be rolling
         around in his grave.
          [the music segues from "Star Wars" to "Twinkle Twinkle, Little
         Star"]
Hibbert: [chuckles] Devilishiously satirical!  I wonder if anyone else
         got that.
-- The Boston Pops, the modern equivalent of death, "The Springfield
    Connection"

"We're out of here," proclaims Homer, dragging Marge along.

They walk home through a seedy part of town.

Homer: Whoa, careful now.  These are dangerous streets for us upper-
       lower-middle class types, so avoid eye contact, watch your
       pocketbook, and suspect everyone.
Snake: Three-Card Monte.
Homer: Woo hoo!  Easy money!  [runs over]
Marge: Homer, these games are fixed.
Homer: Then how come that guy's winning?
  Man: [looks and sounds like Snake] Whoa, I, like, totally won again.
Snake: Way to go, bro!
-- Sincere viperine adulation, 

Marge cautions Homer, "He looks and acts just like the dealer.  I think
they're related, or at least in cahoots."

Snake: Just pick the red card, it's totally not hard.
        [shuffles them a bit]
Homer: Twenty on this one, my good man.  [puts a $20 dows]
Snake: [flips it] Sorry, my good man: black.
        [Marge turns the other two cards over; they're both black]
Marge: Homer, he cheated you!
        [spectators grumble angrily]
Snake: Surely you don't blame _me_!
Marge: It's people like _you_ who are ruining our downtown promenades
       and piazzas.  How dare you prey on the greedy and stupid like
       this!
-- A motherly scolding, 

"Buh-bye," calls Snake hastily, running off.  "Somebody stop him!"
implores Marge, but everyone still stands and stares.  "He's getting
away," she further pleads, "come on, come on!"  Seeing as no one wants
to chase him, she runs after him herself.  "No, Marge!" calls Homer in
pursuit, but he can't follow for long: his breath becomes too labored
and he stops, panting painfully.

Marge starts to gain on the multiply-convicted felon; seeing this, he
turns down an alley, still pursued by Marge.  When he sees it's a dead
end and that he's trapped, he turns around and flicks open a
switchblade.  Marge gasps, "Uh, I must warn you, um...sometimes ordinary
people [stammers] they get a surge of adrenaline."  He advances on her,
and in a panic she smashes him in the face with a garbage can lid.
"See?" she scolds.

Wiggum and some other policemen arrive on the scene.

Wiggum: Cuff him, boys.  We're putting this dirtbag away.
 Snake: Huh!  I'll be back on the street in 24 hours.
Wiggum: We'll try to make it twelve.
         [Homer arrives in a car, still panting]
 Homer: Marge, are you OK?
 Marge: Uh, I think I'm OK.  It was scary, but...in a weird way, it was
        also kind of exhilarating.
 Homer: Yes, it _is_ exhilarating to see the police get their man and
        save a hysterical woman.
 Marge: Oh, for crying out loud --
 Homer: Easy now, sweetheart, Homey's here.
 Marge: Mmm...
-- Secrets of a successful marriage, 

Lisa and Bart hear about Marge's bravery as she makes soup.

 Lisa: Hey Mom, is this how you caught him?
        [throws Bart to the ground with his arm behind his back]
 Bart: [panting] Face it, Lis, you're too puny to -- aah!  Ow!
 Lisa: Heh heh heh...
Marge: Lisa, unhand your brother.
        [Lisa laughs unkindly, does so]
 Bart: Yeah, like that really hurt.  [walks away] [groaning] Oh...
 Lisa: Mom, was catching that guy _the_ most incredibly exciting thing
       you've ever done?
Marge: Well, it _was_ pretty exciting...but celery soup's pretty
       exciting too!
        [chops up the celery, grunting with each piece]
-- The many forms of excitement, 

Marge seems listless and bored at the supermarket.  "Strange," she says,
picking up a can, "regular ham doesn't thrill me any more.  Hmph."
Grabbing a different can, she asserts, "I'm crossing over to deviled
ham!"  Then, when she thinks no one is looking, she pushes her cart
really fast and stands on the front of it, whooping joyously at the
speed.  She loses control of it as it hurtles toward a large hunk of
cheese on display, jumping off just as the cart crashes into the cheese
and becomes completely buried.  She walks away innocently.

When she parks the car and uses the automatic garage door closer, at the
last minute she rolls underneath the descending door.  She jumps for joy
outside the garage and cries, "Marge!"

At another store, Benevenstanciano hands her the new issue of Sponge and
Vacuum magazine (which previews the '96 sponges), but she seems more
interested in the Death Sports section, featuring such titles as Bear
Baiter, Rock Jumper ("The magazine for people who love to jump from rock
to rock"), Mosh Pitter, Danger Liker ("Minefields: Playgrounds for the
'90s"), Cliff Biker, and Glass Eater ("Wine bottles: our ten favorite
vintages").  Her eyes light up at this latter one when behind her, a few
police cars skid to a halt in front of the police station, their sirens
blaring.  A bunch of officers get out of their cars.

Wiggum: All right, get in there.
   Lou: You're going _down_.
 Eddie: I want a piece of him.
Wiggum: You think you're pretty hot, huh?  Well, we got everything we
        need on you.
         [everyone grabs a piece of the pizza]
 Marge: [knocking] Uh, excuse me?
Wiggum: What?  What?  What what what what what?  This better be about
        pizza.
 Marge: Uh, actually, I'm interested in becoming a police officer.
         [everyone laughs for a long time, gradually it fades]
Wiggum: Welcome aboard.
-- Bizzare police initiation, 

Homer can't believe his ears.

Homer: You did _what_?!
 Bart: I borrowed your nail clipper.  What's the big deal?
Homer: Nothing.  I'm just a little edgy since your mother told me she
       wants to be a cop.
 Bart: Cool!  Will you bring me along when you do evictions?
Marge: You got it, little buddy!
Homer: Marge, you being a cop makes you the man...which makes me the
       woman.  I have no interest in that, besides occasionally wearing
       the underwear (which, as we discussed, is strictly a comfort
       thing).
Marge: Homer, there's no reason for you to feel threatened.  You'll
       always be the man of this house.
Homer: Aw, thanks honey.
        [they kiss; Homer bends one of his knees coquettishly]
-- Gender-bending heaven, 

Marge reports to recruit training.

Wiggum: All right, you scrawny beanpoles: becoming a cop is _not_
        something that happens overnight.  It takes one solid weekend of
        training to get that badge.
   Man: Forget about the badge!  When do we get the freakin' guns?!
Wiggum: Hey, I told you, you don't get your gun until you tell me your
        name.
   Man: I've had it up to here with your "rules"!  [walks off]
-- Stacy Koons in training, 

Marge does the obstacle course, carrying concrete blocks up a hill,
swinging on ropes, crawling under a fence, and struggling to climb over
a tall brick wall.  "Women always seem to have trouble with the wall,"
observes Wiggum.  "They can't ever seem to find the door."

On the shooting range, Marge walks through a town made of wooden house
and building facades.  Various people (criminal and non-criminal alike)
appear in windows, and Marge must shoot only the criminals and spare the
non-criminals.  She achieves a perfect score, only Wiggum admonishes her
afterwards: "You missed the baby, you missed the blind man..."

The last test is a high-speed drive in a police car through traffic
cones, over hills, and across an incomplete freeway.  As she skids to a
halt at the finish, Wiggum says, "Oh, sorry, Simpson: you'll have to do
the course again.  I was trying to get this, er, Magic Eye thing to
work.  Aw, look at that!  Heh, a pony."

Everyone else watches TV at home when Marge walks in.  "Hey, everybody:
Mom's home!"  They all turn and stare at Marge who wears a cop uniform,
all except for her "Hard Rock Cafe" shirt.  "They didn't have my size
shirt, but you get the idea."

[End of Act One.  Time: 7:23]

At breakfast, Marge eats a donut and drinks coffee as everyone else eats
their regular things.

 Bart: Wow, Mom, I never pictured you as any kind of authority figure
       before.
Homer: Marge, I want you to take care of yourself out there.  You've
       become very dear to me.
Marge: Oh, Homey, of course I will.
 Lisa: Mom, if someone shot at the mayor, would you have to throw
       yourself in front of him and take the bullet?
Marge: I suppose I would.
 Bart: What if they shot at a Coke machine?
Marge: No.
 Bart: TV?
Marge: No.
 Bart: TV with a picture of the mayor on it?
 Lisa: Whatever you do, Mom, we'll be proud of you.
Marge: Well thank you, honey.
 Lisa: As long as it's constitutional.
Marge: Mmm.  Homer, give me my pepper spray!
Homer: Oh, Marge, one squirt and you're south of the border!  [eats
       something] Mmm, incapacitating...[his eyes water]
-- Marge's first day on the beat, 

Marge turns up at the station for assignment.

Wiggum: All right, settle, people.  People, settle.  People!  Ward and
        Van Zuylen, stake out Donut Land: when they fry up a fresh
        batch, call it in.  Keneally and Earhart, back 'em up.
        Fitz and Garcia, it's your turn to sleep in.
         [they remove their caps and don nightcaps]
        And Simpson, seeing how this is your first day, you're
        inexperienced and vulnerable.  Your beat is Junkyville and
        Bumtown.
-- The first-day assignments, 

Marge walks past the legal clinic when she espies Lionel Hutz rooting
through a dumpster.

Marge: Hello, Mr. Hutz.
 Hutz: I'll have you know the contents of that dumpster are private!
       You stick your nose in, you'll be violating attorney-dumpster
       confidentiality.
Marge: I just wanted to say "hello".
 Hutz: Oh.  Hello.  [laughs nervously]
        [Marge walks off; Hutz torches the contents of the dumpster]
-- The truth _was_ out there, 

She walks into Apu's Kwik-E-Mart.

     Apu: So, you are the new cop on the beat.  [sighing] OK, I know the
          drill: what will it be?  $100?  $200?
   Marge: $200.  [realizing] No, no!  I mean, nothing!  I don't take
          bribes.
     Apu: Yes, of course you don't.  I will just leave this money on the
          table with my unseeing back to the money on the table.
           [he turns around]
   Marge: Apu, no.
           [she turns around]
           [Mr. Burns walks by, snatches the money]
Together: [seeing the money gone] That's better!
-- Stash those "Gigantic Asses" magazines away, "The Springfield
    Connection"

{Marge pulls up outside a house where yelling is going on.  The scene
becomes that as filmed by a hand-held camera; the text "3:10pm,
disturbance call appears on the screen".}

      Marge: {I got a report on a domestic disturbance at this address.}
    Skinner: {Yes, indeed there is.  There's an inflatable bath pillow
             that mother and I both enjoy.  She claimed it was her day
             to use it, I maintained she was mistaken, we quarreled.
             Later, as I prepared to bathe, I noticed to my horror that
             _someone_ had slashed the pillow.}
      Marge: {Uh huh.  Who called the police?}
Skinner+Mom: {We both did.}
      Marge: {Look, why don't you two settle down?  I'm sure you can get
             another pillow.}
    Skinner: {Well, I could send it back to Taiwan for repair, but why
             should I have to?  I've done nothing wrong.  And I _don't_
             give permission for my face to be on TV: I want it blurred!
              [his face becomes blurred]}
-- "Cops" comes to Springfield, 

In the next scene, Marge lies on a couch in her bathrobe.

   Lisa: So Mom, what are you going to do with your day off?
  Marge: I just want to relax and forget that I'm part of that thin blue
         line which stands between civilization and chaos.  [sighs]
          [Bart walks in with his skateboard]
         Bart, it's illegal for you to operate that class nine vehicle
         without pads and a helmet.
   Bart: But Mom --
  Marge: It's for your own safety.
          [later, Bart gets beat up by Dolph, Jimbo, and Kearney]
Kearney: Take that, Safety Boy!
  Jimbo: This padding's so easy on the knuckles, I could punch all day!
-- Hey there, Safety Boy, 

In the hairdressing salon, the Springfield ladies chatter while getting
their hair dried.

 Maude: I just hope they have Us magazine in heaven.
Mrs. S: He said it was his day to use the tub pillow.
  Edna: I can't go to the library anymore, everybody stinks!
         [they talk amongst themselves; Marge walks in]
 Marge: Don't stop talking on account of me.  I may be a cop, but I'm
        still your friend.  [everyone looks at her]
        So how are you, Mrs. Krabappel?
  Edna: Law-abiding.  I'm done!  [she runs out]
 Marge: Moe!  I've never seen you here before.
   Moe: [awkward] Well, these days my roots don't stay so chestnut on
        their own, Officer Simpson.
 Marge: You don't have to call me "Officer", I'm not on duty here.
         [a barber lowers a chair; it sounds like a shot]
         [Marge rolls and points her gun at everyone]
 Marge: Oh, heh.  Looks nice, it's, er, it's a good length for you.
-- Small talk, 

Homer whistles while he strings police line around a house.

 Lisa: Mom's police tape isn't a toy, Dad.
Homer: Shush, dear.  You'll wreck Daddy's fun.
  Ned: [walking up, singing] Bringing in the sheaves, bringing in the --
       oh my Lord.  Something horrible has happened!
Homer: [snickers, then laughs] Fooled you, Flanders!  Made you think
       your family was dead.  [laughs] Don't you get it?
  Ned: [strained] Heh.  Heh heh...
Homer: They're not, though.
  Ned: Oh?
Homer: [laughs] But you thought they were!
  Ned: Yeah.
Homer: That's why it was so funny.  [laughs]
  Ned: Heh heh, that's a good one...
-- Give that man the $100,000, 

Marge takes Lisa on a tour of the station.

 Marge: And that's the drunk tank --
Barney: [groaning] Oh --
 Marge: -- and this is Mommy's desk.
  Lisa: Mom, I know your intentions are good but aren't the police the
        protective force that maintains the status quo for the wealthy
        elite?  Don't you think we ought to attack the roots of social
        problems instead of jamming people into overcrowded prisons?
 Marge: [pauses] Look Lisa, it's McGriff, the Crime Dog!  [uses a hand
        puppet] Hey, Lisa, help me bite crime, ruff, ruff!
-- "Bite Back" merchandise, 

Lenny has an announcement for the poker buddies in Homer's kitchen.

 Lenny: Hey, great news, guys: I picked up a nudie deck for our game.
 Homer: [grabs it] "The Girls of the Internet"...ooh, I'd go on-line
        with them any day!
         [everyone clamors]
   Moe: Hey, hey: we've offended Herman.
Herman: No, no, I'm just going out for some fresh air.
   Moe: Jeez, that guy sure likes his fresh air.  None of that for me!
        [puffs on a huge cigar, coughs] Oh, yeah, yeah!
-- The Stale Air Fund, 

 Carl: Hey, Homer, are you sure it's OK to smoke Cuban cigars and gamble
       here now that your wife's a cop?
Homer: Are you kidding?  Being a cop husband is one mighty sweet deal!
       This police radio entertains me with other people's miseries, we
       get a free funeral for Marge (God forbid), and I can run
       background checks on whomever I want!  [to Moe] -- Mohammar.
  Moe: Homer, please!  Please, ixnay on the ohammar-May.
Homer: [holding a radar gun] Hey, hurry it up with the cards, Lenny:
       I've got you clocked at two miles per hour.
Lenny: Come on, put that away: those radar guns give you cancer.
Homer: All the more reason for you to hurry up.  Hey, what could be
       going a hundred miles per -- ow!  [Lenny slugs him]
-- Homer's love for technology, 

 Marge: [gasps] Illegal gambling in my house?
   Moe: _Your_ house?  _Your_ house?  Gee, it's so glamorously decorated
        I thought I was in Vegas!  Hey, you guys lied to me: you said it
        was Vegas!
Barney: Yeah, well we'll be going.
         [everyone leaves, murmuring]
 Homer: Marge, you chased away all my poker buddies!
 Marge: I didn't mean to.
 Homer: Oh, you've become such a cop.  And not that long ago you were so
        much more to me: you were a cleaner of pots, a sewer of buttons,
        an unclogger of hairy clogs.
 Marge: I'm still all those things, only now I'm cleaning up the city,
        sewing together the social fabric, and unplugging the clogs of
        our legal system.
 Homer: You're cooking what for dinner?
-- Marge attempts a parallel structure, 

Marge loses her enthusiasm for police work the next day.

Marge: [thinking] Everywhere I look, someone is breaking the law.  Dog,
       no leash.  Man, littering.  Horse, not wearing diaper.  Car
       parked across _three_ handicap spaces...[spoken] Homer!
Homer: Hey, Marge.  How's my little piglet?
Marge: Homer, I'm on duty.
Homer: Heh heh, that's OK, I'm supposed to be working too.  [chuckles]
Marge: You have to move your car.
Homer: I'll just be a second, Marge, I'm going to get some beer for
       those kids over there.
        [Dolph, Jimbo, and Kearney all give the thumbs up]
Marge: I'm going to pretend that I didn't hear that, but you have to
       move your car now.
Homer: I'll be right back.  Now keep your eyes peeled for a real cop.
-- Marge, chopped liver, 

Marge: Oh, that's it: I'm going to write you a ticket.
Homer: But Marge!  We're family.
Marge: You're breaking the law.
Homer: I'll make you a deal: you rip up that ticket and I'll give you
       back your hat.  [snatches it]
Marge: Hey!
        [Homer taunts her; Marge grabs for it]
        [a crowd assembles to watch]
       Homer, taking an officer's cap is an arrestable offense.
Homer: Ooh, what are you going to do about it?  What are you going to
       do, huh?  [Marge's voice] Ooh, I'm officer Marge, I'm going to
       arrest you.  Wha -- what?
        [Marge snaps handcuffs on him]
       Marge, not here.  Hey...you're not really arresting me?
Marge: You have the right to remain silent.
Homer: I choose to waive that right.  [screams like a sissy]
-- His attorney will be Lionel Hutz, I'm guessing, "The Springfield
    Connection"

[End of Act Two.  Time: 15:47]

Wiggum comes to get Homer out of his jail cell.

 Wiggum: All right, Simpson, you're free to go.
  Homer: Let me just finish this last lobster tail and raspberry tort.
         [does so]
Lovejoy: [in the next cell] All right, Hans, time to go.
   Hans: But he ate my last meal.
Lovejoy: Well, if that's the worst thing that happens to you today,
         consider yourself lucky.
   Hans: Are you really allowed to execute people in a local jail?
Lovejoy: From this point on, no talking.
          [Hans is led away by two men]
-- The Moleman bites the dust, 

Marge is apologetic to Homer.

Marge: I'm sorry I had to arrest you, Homer, but what I did was right.
       Some day when you really need it you'll be happy there are
       dedicated cops like me out there.
Homer: I have nothing more to say to you, Marge.  I'm drawing a line
       down the center of the house a la "I Love Lucy".  You stay on
       your side and I'll stay on my side.
        [sees he's drawn himself into a corner]
       D'oh!
-- Aw, Ricky, 

Homer laments his treatment to his poker buddies.

 Homer: Boy, when Marge first told me she was going to the police
        academy, I thought it'd be fun and exciting, you know, like that
        movie, "Spaceballs".  But instead it's been painful and
        disturbing like that movie "Police Academy".
Barney: Hey Homer, I'm worried about the beer supply.  After this case,
        and the other case, there's only one case left!
         [pretending to be the other people in the room] Yeah, yeah!
        Uh, Barney's right.  Yeah, let's drink some more beer.  Yeah!
        Hey, what about some beer?  Yeah, Barney's right.
 Homer: All right, guys, pipe down.  I got some more in the garage.
Herman: [quickly] Uh, I'll, I'll get it for you, Homer.
 Homer: Hmm.  I wonder why he's so eager to go to the garage?
   Moe: The "garage"?  Hey fellas, the "garage"!  Well, ooh la di da,
        Mr. French Man.
 Homer: Well what do _you_ call it?
   Moe: A car hole!
-- Homer gets his vocabulary built, 

Herman walks into the garage with a briefcase.  Three men wait for him.

Jericho: You're late, Herman.
 Herman: Surely you don't mind waiting for merchandise of this quality,
         Mr. Jericho?
Jericho: [checking the contents of the briefcase] Looks like good stuff,
         but of course, I'll have to sample it first.
          [trying on a pair of pants] These are fabulous!
 Herman: Yeah.  Who would suspect that they're counterfeit jeans?
Jericho: And what better place to make the buy than a cop's garage where
         no one would suspect a thing?
          [they all laugh evilly]
-- The notorious jean-smuggling ring, 

 Homer: Hey Herman, I had to come out here to see what's so funny.
        [gasps] A counterfeit jeans ring operating out of my car hole!
        I'm going to tell everyone.  Wait here.
Herman: Not so fast.  [levels a gun]
 Homer: [slows his gait] OK.
Herman: Maybe you should just stop entirely.
 Homer: [stops] Herman, how could you?  We've all thought about
        counterfeiting jeans at one time or another, but what about the
        victims?  Hard-working designers like Calvin Klein, Gloria
        Vanderbilt, or Antoine Bugle Boy.  _These_ are the people who
        saw an overcrowded marketplace and said, "Me too!"
-- Homer pleads on the side of capitalism, 

Herman: [ominous] Advance on him, men.
 Marge: [appearing at the garage door] I don't think that's a very good
        idea.
 Crony: Oh no, it's Gloria Vanderbilt out for revenge!
 Marge: No, it's Officer Simpson of the police.
         [handcuffs the men; Herman rolls away and points his gun at
        Marge]
 Homer: Herman, your beef is with me!  Leave the girl out of this.
Herman: OK.  [grabs him as hostage]
 Marge: [gasps] Homer!
 Homer: It's too late for me, Marge!  Sell the jeans and live like a
        queen!
-- Last-ditch pleas, 

Herman escapes out the side door with Homer.  Marge goes out into the
yard looking for him.  Milhouse comes out from behind a tree: "Is Bart
home?"  Grampa pushes a pram out: "Just taking Maggie for a stroll."  A
hideous witch appears from behind a fence and Marge shoots it.  "Well,"
notes Ned, "I guess I _am_ putting up the Hallowe'en decorations a
little early.  Criticism accepted."

"Marge!" cries Homer from Bart's treehouse.  Marge begins the ascent;
Lisa and Bart cheer her on from an upstairs window.  "Go back to bed!"
she admonishes, "Don't make me come up there."  The children groan, turn
out the light, then continue to watch.

Herman says slyly to his captive, "Looks like your wife is embarking up
the wrong tree."  Herman aims his gun at the entrance, but Marge comes
in through the secret trapdoor, knocking Herman sprawling.  "Freeze!"
she cries.  "Every mother knows the secret entrance to her son's
treehouse."

 Homer: Oh, Marge, you saved my life!  I'm sorry I teased you.  You are
        a really good cop.  I'm proud of you.
         [they embrace]
Herman: So long, gotta catch the 5:01!
         [uses jeans to slide down a rope]
 Homer: He's getting away!  You blew it, Marge.
 Marge: I don't think so.
         [the jeans start to rip]
Herman: Oh, foiled by my own shoddy merchandise!
         [he falls to the ground]

Herman is wheeled into an ambulance.

   Abe: That's _my_ ambulance.  I called for it four hours ago.
 Homer: Marge, how did you know --
 Marge: That the pants would rip?
 Homer: No, what I was wondering was --
 Marge: Years of buying pants for two active children and a full-seated
        husband has given me a sixth sense for shoddy stitching -- which
        these jeans have in spades.
Wiggum: That's some nice work, Simpson, but, um, we can't hold him.
        There's no evidence.
 Homer: Yes there is, there's a garage full of counterfeit jeans.
Wiggum: Um, they've, uh, mysteriously, er, disappeared.
         [all the policemen put on new jeans]
        Looking good, boys.
 Marge: That's it.  There's too much corruption on this force.  I quit.
         [all the policemen laugh for a long time]
Wiggum: Ah.  Sorry to lose you, Simpson.
 Lenny: [in the kitchen] I don't think they're coming back.
   Moe: All right, that does it: I'm looking at his cards.
         [does so] Aw, crap.  I fold.

 EPISODE TITLE: Lemon of Troy


EPISODE SUMMARY: 
[Syndication cuts are marked in curly braces "{}" and are courtesy of
Frederic Briere.]

It's a beautiful day for skateboarding.  Bart skates happily downtown
when in the far distance he notices a sign.

 Bart: [gasps] "Wet cement"!  Is there any sweeter sign?  Well, maybe
       "High voltage".
        [skates towards it]
        [a safe full of jewels falls in front of him; he hops it]
Frink: Hello, son.  You want to try the flying motorcycle I just
       invented?
 Bart: No time.
Frink: OK -- [takes off]
-- Bart with a mission, 

Bart arrives at the cement and kneels before it.

    Bart: This is for the ages.
           [flash to futuristic city with people crowded around]
           [the word "Bart" is etched in the concrete]
   Woman: Like Stonehenge, this site will forever be a mystery.  Who was
          Bart?  And how did he manage to write his name in solid
          cement?
   Man 1: He must have been much smarter than his sister Lisa -- about
          whom we know nothing.
   Man 2: Say, let's bring him back to life by using technology!
           [shoots a ray; Bart materializes]
    Bart: Ay, Caramba!
           [everyone applauds]
           [Bart pulls out a yoyo and starts using it]
Everyone: Ooh!  Aah.
   Man 1: What's normal to him amazes us.
   Man 2: He will be our new god.
Everyone: Yay!
-- The world according to Bart, 

Back in the present, Bart writes his name in the wet cement.

 Bart: Oh, good: somebody's shadow.  I'll just turn and brag about my
       work.  [turns] Aah!
Marge: Bart, you've graffito-tagged public property!
 Bart: It was an accident!
-- It was the best of times, 

At dinner, Marge scolds Bart in front of the rest of the family.

Marge: I can't believe you vandalized your own hometown, Bart.  What
       would Jebediah Springfield say?
 Bart: I think he'd be cool with it.
Marge: Oh.  Homer, will you please help me make a big deal of this?
Homer: What for?  Nobody cared when Bogart defaced that sidewalk in
       Hollywood.
-- Except Jebediah Hollywood, maybe, 

Marge: Well, I'm just shocked by this whole family.  Whatever happened
       to good old-fashioned town pride?
 Lisa: It's been going downhill ever since the lake caught fire.
Marge: Now just a darn minute.  This town is a part of who you are.
       This [holds one up] is a Springfield Isotopes cap.  When you wear
       it, you're wearing Springfield.  When you eat a fish from our
       river, you're eating Springfield.  When you make lemonade from
       our tree, you're drinking Springfield.
 Bart: Mom, when you give that lecture, you're boring Springfield.
Marge: Bart, you have roots in this town and you ought to show respect
       for it.  This town is a part of us all.  A part of us all.  A
       part of us all!  Sorry to repeat myself, but it'll help you
       remember.
        [later, Bart skateboards]
Marge: [in Bart's head] This town is a part of us all.  A part of us
       all.  A part of us all!
 Bart: Wow, that _does_ work.
-- Marge Mnemonic, 

{Bart skates past the practicing Isotopes.  "Hey," he calls, "gonna win
some this season?"  A largish player calls back, "Gonna try."  He turns
back to his teammate and throws the ball ineffectively towards him.}

A plastic toy soldier descends into the waters of the river.  A fish
takes the bait, to be hauled out by Nelson.

Nelson: When it comes to catching trout, nothing beats the German light
        infantry.
  Bart: Beautiful, aren't they.  [referring to the trout]
Nelson: Yup.  I'm gonna huck 'em at cars.
         [tosses one; it splats, tires screech, a crash is heard]
-- Ways to get aggression out, 

Milhouse and Lewis run a lemonade stand.

    Bart: Hey, Milhouse!  How's the lemonade business?
Milhouse: It's clearly booming, Bart.
           [Lisa holds a glass]
    Lisa: [to Bart] I don't even want any.  I just bought a pity glass.
Milhouse: [gasps] We've squozen our whole supply.  To the lemon tree!
-- Milhouse fail English?, 

Milhouse and Bart run off to the lemon tree.  They walk along a log
across a river, then hop from stone to stone across another river
(Milhouse gets a couple of soakers), then through a loose board in a
fence (Milhouse gets hit on the head), then down a hill (Milhouse trips
and bounces down it).  Through some bushes they spy the lemon tree, its
aura palpable.  Database, Martin, and Todd dance joyously around it.
"Thar she grows," comments Milhouse with awe.

Bart picks a lemon from the tree and sniffs it.

    Bart: You know, Milhouse, I've been thinking: this town ain't so
          bad.  Good friends, lots of lemons, numerous angel
          sightings...when you get right down to it, Springfield's a
          pretty cool place to live.
  Shelby: Springfield sucks!
           [a group of kids stands behind the Shelbyville town line]
    Bart: Hey!  Stop talking bad about my town, man.
  Shelby: Why don't you make me?
    Bart: I don't make trash, I burn it.
  Shelby: Then I guess you're a garbage man.
    Bart: Well, I know _you_ are, but what am I?
  Shelby: A garbage man.
    Bart: I know _you_ are, but what am I?
  Shelby: A garbage man.
    Bart: I know you are, but what am I?
  Shelby: A garbage man.
    Bart: Takes one to know one!
           [Shelby looks surprised]
Database: Checkmate!
-- Verbal sparring, 

 Milhouse: Hey, kid: stop wearing your backpack over one shoulder.  We
           invented that, copycats.
Milhouse2: Uh, you copied us!
 Milhouse: Step over this line and say that!  I'll kick your butt!
           [quietly] ...at Nintendo.
            [Shelby tosses a rock over the line]
   Shelby: I just put a rock in your crummy town.
     Bart: That's a crud rock.  It belongs in Crudtown.
            [tries to lift it and fails; other kids laugh]
   Shelby: Look at the weak little baby.  You're stupid, you stupid weak
           baby!  C'mon, let's get out of here.
     Bart: Hey!  They're taking our lemons.
 Milhouse: We can't spare a single one!
            [the Springfield kids start hurling lemons at the other
           kids]
   Shelby: You just got citric acid in my eye!  You'll pay for that,
           Springfield.
      Abe: [seated nearby] Aw, some things never change.
 Milhouse: Hey, everybody.  An old man's talking!
-- Better pipe down and listen, then, 

They gather round to listen.

 Abe: Grampa's the name.  Did you know this tree dates back to frontier
      times?
Kids: Wow!  Frontier times. etc.
 Abe: Shut up!
-- Maybe intimate, but not interactive, 

     Abe: It all began when Jebediah Springfield first came to these
          lands with his partner, Shelbyville Manhattan.
           [flash to pilgrims approaching a hilltop]
Jebediah: People, our search is over!  On this site we shall build a new
          town where we can worship freely, govern justly, and grow vast
          fields of hemp for making rope and blankets.
  Shelb.: Yes, _and_ marry our cousins.
Jebediah: I was -- what are you talking about, Shelbyville?  Why would
          we want to marry our cousins?
  Shelb.: Because they're so attractive.  I, I thought that was the
          whole point of this journey.
Jebediah: Absolutely not!
  Shelb.: I tell you, I won't live in a town that robs men of the right
          to marry their cousins.
Jebediah: Well, then, we'll form our own town.  Who will come and live a
          life devoted to chastity, abstinence, and a flavorless mush I
          call rootmarm?
           [the people divide between Jebediah and Shelbyville]
     Abe: The town of Springfield was born on that day, and to mark that
          sweet moment, our people planted this lemon tree (lemons being
          the sweetest fruit available at the time).
-- From humble beginnings, 

In class, Mrs. Krabappel writes roman numerals on the blackboard.

    Bart: Those Shelbyville kids think they're so hot, but you know
          what?  They're not.
Milhouse: I really agree with you on this one, Bart.
    Edna: Class, please!  If you don't learn roman numerals, you'll
          never know the date certain motion pictures were copyrighted.
  Nelson: [bursting in] Everybody come quick!  Something's happened.  No
          time to explain.
           [all the children run out]
    Edna: No, children, no!  Your education is important.  Roman
          numerals, etcetera.  Whatever.  I tried!  [lights a cigarette]
-- Edna's best effort, 

The kids stop at a drinking fountain so Nelson can refresh himself.
"Are you sure it wouldn't be faster," Milhouse pants, "to just tell us
what happened?"  Nelson rebukes him: "No.  I said there's no time to
explain and I stick by that."  They continue running until they get to
the site of the lemon tree -- which has now vanished.

    Bart: The lemon tree's gone!
  Martin: And the tracks appear to lead into Shelbyville.
Database: Oh look, a clue.  A candy bar wrapper.
Milhouse: [contemptuous] Oh, they're _always_ eating candy in
          Shelbyville.  They _love_ the sweet taste.
    Bart: We got to get that tree back.
Database: Oh, you mean going to Shelbyville?  Heh, we'll never make it
          out alive.
    Bart: That lemon tree's a part of our town, and as kids, the
          backbone of our economy.  We'll get it back, or choke their
          rivers with our dead!
-- He meant "their dead", 

{At home, Marge vacuums under Homer's feet.}

Marge: {Where are you going, Bart?}
 Bart: {Mom, you won't believe this, but something you said the other
       day really got through to me.}
Marge: {[happy] Mmm!}
 Bart: {And now, I am going to teach some kids a lesson.  [slams door]}
Marge: {I choose to take that literally.}
 Bart: {[outside] Death to Shelbyville!}
Homer: {Yes, Bart's a tutor now.  Tute on, son!  Tute on.}
-- Parental encouragement, 

[End of Act One.  Time: 7:40]

Bart runs by Milhouse's place.  "Hey Milhouse!  Get your invasion
supplies and let's go!"  Milhouse pulls a camouflage outfit from his
closet and imagines putting it to use.  In his fantasy, he's being
chased by some Shelbyville kids, but he steps in front of a bush and
disappears.  The kids stop and look around, asking "Where did he go?"
Milhouse calls, "Over here, my friends!"  His head moves to a different
place and he sneers, "Or is it over _here_?"  His head keeps changing
place and the other children's anger turns to fear.  "Yeah," the real
Milhouse says blissfully.

At the town line, Bart assembles his men.

Bart: OK, here's how it goes: I'm the leader, Milhouse is my loyal
      sidekick, Nelson's the tough guy, Martin's the smart guy, and
      Todd's the quiet religious guy who ends up going crazy.  And now,
      the time has come to cross this line into mystery and danger -- to
      step out of childhood and become men.
       [Bart steps over with trepidation]
       [the other kids follow]
       [in the background, Lisa and another girl cross the line freely
      while they fly a kite, giggling and cheering]
-- Bart delineates the roles, 

In Shelbyville, the troupe walk along.

  Bart: Remember: if you get lost, you can always find East by staring
        directly at the sun.
Martin: Here's a tip: put a pinch of sage in your boots, and all day
        long a spicy scent is your reward.
         [Nelson cuffs him]
-- Come home my bonny warrior, 

 Milhouse: Oh my gosh!  Look: the fire hydrants here are yellow.
   Nelson: This place is starting to freak me out.
     Todd: [with a periscope] Danger coming...behind us!
            [they jump over a wall]
            [the Shelbyville's kids' dog growls]
Milhouse2: What is it, boy?  Is there something behind that wall we
           should beat up?
   Shelby: No time to check it out now.  We've got lemonade to sell.
            [they walk off]
Milhouse2: Huh.  Radical.
     Bart: They're getting rich off us!
 Milhouse: And the kid with the backpack said "radical".  _I_ say
           "radical".  That's my thing that I say!  I feel like I'm
           going to explode here...[shakes violently]
            [Todd steps back]
-- Milhouse's California roots, 

At home, Marge worries about where Bart could be.

Marge: It's almost lunch time.  Do you know where your brother is
       tutoring?
 Lisa: Pfft.  Tutoring?  The only thing Bart's teaching is guerilla
       combat in Shelbyville.
Marge: Well, do you have a number where we can reach him?
 Lisa: No, Mom, Bart and some kids ran off to wage war on Shelbyville!
Marge: [gasps] Homer!  Come quick!  Bart's quit his tutoring job and
       joined a violence gang!
-- As opposed to a gang for peace and love, 

In Shelbyville, the trail of lemons peters out.

Database: Uh, the trail has become indistinct.  I suggest we split up to
          cover more ground.
    Bart: Good idea.  Milhouse, you and me will be Omega Team.  Todd,
          you and Data are Team Strike Force.  Nelson, that leaves you
          and Martin.
  Martin: Team Discovery Channel!
  Nelson: [groaning] Oh...your wussiness better come in handy.
-- An unlikely pairing, 

The Springfield parents gather on the Simpson lawn to discuss the plight
of their children.

       Ned: OK, folks, look: I called the police captain in Shelbyville.
            He says he hasn't seen our kids, but if they show up in the
            morgue, he'll fax us.
 Mr. Van H: Oh, man, I _hate_ those Shelbyville jerks.
Mrs. Van H: Honey, _I_ was born in Shelbyville.
 Mr. Van H: And it tears me up inside!
     Marge: This is my fault.  I tried to teach Bart about town pride,
            but the power of my words filled him with a sort of madness.
     Homer: Now, Marge, you can't blame all of Bart's problems on your
            one little speech.  If anything turned him bad, it's that
            time you let him wear a bathing suit instead of underwear.
            _And_ let's not forget your little speech!
     Marge: Isn't there anything we can do?
     Homer: Yes there is!  Come on, everybody, let's go into Shelbyville
            and get those kids back ourselves.  I got an RV we can use:
            Flanderses!
  Everyone: Yay!  Let's do it. etc.
  Flanders: Well, OK, but you know, just go a little bit easy on --
     Homer: Pile in, everybody.  No time to wipe your feet.
-- Wouldn't want to waste valuable seconds, 

In Shelbyville, Martin and Nelson come across a boy making lemonade.
Martin accosts him.

 Martin: OK, piglet, start squealing.  Where'd you get the lemons for
         this lemonade?
    Boy: Uh...this is Country Time lemonade mix.  There's never been
         anything close to a lemon in it, I swear!
Brother: Hey, _nobody_ hassles my little brother.
 Martin: Hey!  And _no one_ manhandles the bosom chum of Nelson Mundt.
         Spring forth, burly protector, and save me!
          [long pause; the kids look around]
 Nelson: Aw, jeez.  I never hang out with him, normally.
          [throws the brother off Martin]
 Martin: [skipping around Nelson and singing]
         Hark to the tale of Nelson,
         and the boy he loved so dear.
          [Nelson takes a swipe at him but misses]
         They remained the best of friends
         For years and years and years.
-- And there was much rejoicing, 

Bart watches a pair of boys through a telescope.

Milhouse: What are they saying?
    Bart: I'm not sure.
Milhouse: I thought you said you could read lips.
    Bart: I assumed I could.
-- Bart watches some kids from afar, 

Bart rues, "It's no use, Milhouse.  If we're going to find that lemon
tree, I've _got_ to go undercover.  What I need is a new face."
Milhouse pulls out "Baron Von Costume's Deluxe Disguise Kit" and grins,
"You leave that to the Baron and me."

Bart walks up to the Shelbyville kids wearing a black wig and with a
scar on his right cheek.

   Bart: Hello, there, fellow Shelbyvillians.
Martin2: Wait a minute.  If you're from Shelbyville, how come we've
         never seen you at school?
   Bart: I don't go to school.
Nelson2: OK.  What's two plus two?
   Bart: Five.
Nelson2: Oh.  Story checks out.
-- Bart, diabolical, 

   Shelby: We just got word there's Springfield kids in town.
            [all the kids growl]
     Bart: Curse those handsome devils!
   Shelby: We're going up to the bluffs to paint "Springfield sucks" in
           huge letters.  That way, whenever they look into Shelbyville,
           they will realize that they suck.
Milhouse2: Ho ho, radical!
 Milhouse: [on Bart's walkie talkie] Quit copying me!
   Shelby: You know, I wish there was a Springfield kid right now.  I'd
           fill his mouth with stinkbugs!
     Bart: No, not in my mouth!  ...uh, is what that kid would say.  To
           the bluffs!
-- Bart infiltrates the inner cadre, 

Ned pulls up at a gas station in his RV.

  Ned: [nervous] Well, a friendly Springfield "Hello" there, neighbors.
       Uh, you know, we think some kids of ours may be missing in your
       town.
Man 1: Missing children?
Man 2: Sounds like Springfield's got a discipline problem.
Man 3: Maybe that why we beat them at football nearly half the time,
       huh?
        [everyone laughs as Ned drives off]
-- The laws of probability, 

Up at the bluffs, Bart gets badgered.

   Shelby: Quit stalling, kid.  Write "Springfield sucks" in giant
           letters.
            [Bart groans, starts to do so]
           His can control is excellent.
Milhouse2: Yes.  And that wig makes him look a lot like one of the
           Beatles.
            [they all gasp: Bart has written "Springfield rules,
           suckers!"]
     Bart: That's right: the stranger who walks amongst you is me, Bart
           Simpson!
     Kids: Huh?
     Bart: You know, Bart Simpson?
            [kids look at each other]
     Bart: From Springfield?
   Shelby: He's from Springfield!  Get him!
-- The jig becomes up, 

The kids advance on him.

[End of Act Two.  Time: 13:52]

As the gang of children advance on Bart, they lick tattoos onto their
arms that say "Kill", "Destroy", and "Motor cycle".

  Bart: I'll use these spray cans as jet packs and fly to safety.  So
        long, losers!
         [succeeds only in spraying his feet green]
        Heh heh heh...
Shelby: You're dead...
  Bart: Uh...hey look!  Someone's attractive cousin!
         [the other kids turn to stare]
-- Bart knows his captors, 

Bart snickers as he grabs one kid's skateboard and rides off to safety.
"So," says Shelby, "he thinks he can out-skateboard me, huh?  Launch me,
boys!"  His friends give him a push and off he skates, down the same
path as Bart.

Bart's first hurdle is a barrier which he successfully hops; Shelby
navigates it equally successfully.  Bart barely ducks under a swinging
wrecking ball; Shelby ducks under it on its return journey.  Bart skates
through a length of pipe and out; Shelby performs the stunt with equal
skill.  The boys skate past a Speed-E-Mart with a Korean owner, past
Joe's bar (replete with Moe-lookalike standing outside), and Shelbyville
Elementary School where Willy's female double admonishes them: "Slow
down, you sidewalk-surfing cube gleamers!"

Bart manages to pull ahead of Shelby, only to get tossed off his board
upon hitting a patch of wet cement.  "I could sure use that flying
motorcycle now," he rues, pulling at the board.  Dr. Frink flies by on
it: "You had your chance!"  Bart runs through the fence into the
Shelbyville Zoo, the Shelbyville kids in hot pursuit.  He locks himself
into a building with a sign reading "Danger: Tiger feeding area".

"Ah...safe at last!" he sighs.  He notices twelve doors with roman
numerals on them, and a note attached to door VIII: "Caution: exit
through door 7 only.  All other rooms contain man-eating tigers."  The
tigers growl hungrily.  "Roman numerals?  They never even _tried_ to
teach us that in school."  The Shelbyville kids pound on the door.

     Bart: [on walkie talkie] Milhouse!  What's seven in roman numerals?
 Milhouse: I'll tell you, Bart, but you really should end each
           transmission with the word "over".  Over!
Milhouse2: [snatching Milhouse's walkie talkie] Correction: the only
           thing that's over is this transmission.
 Milhouse: Is this the untimely end of Milhouse?
Milhouse2: [pause] But Milhouse is my name!
 Milhouse: But I thought I was the only one!
Milhouse2: [shakes head] A pain I know all too well.
 Milhouse: So this is what it feels like...when doves cry.
-- The boy formerly known as "Milhouse", 

Bart: [into walkie talkie] Milhouse...Milhouse!
      _Now_ what do I do?
       [pounding on outside door gets louder]
      I got it...I got it!
       [opens door IX; a tiger springs at him; he slams it]
      I don't got it.  Think, Bart.  _Where_ have you seen roman
      numerals before?  I know...Rocky V ["vee"]!  That was the fifth
      one.  So, Rocky five plus Rocky two equals...Rocky VII!  "Adrian's
      Revenge"!
-- Bart reasons his way out of the tiger lair, 

And not a minute too soon.  The other kids burst in just as Bart escapes
through door VII and locks it shut behind him.  "Oh, it's no use," he
moans walking away, "I'm _never_ going to find that tree.  This whole
raid was as useless as that yellow lemon-shaped rock over there.  Wait a
minute...there's a lemon behind that rock!"  He picks it up and looks
up: "The tree!"  Except its base is inside the Shelbyville Car Impound
Lot.

The gang of Springfield children assemble on a hilltop overlooking the
impound lot.  The Shelbyville children ride around it on motorbikes
while the Springfield kids look through binoculars at it.

  Martin: Aw, a car impound lot: the impenetrable fortress of suburbia!
Milhouse: We'll never get the tree back now.
    Bart: Keep your voices down, boys: we didn't come this far to get
          found out.
   Homer: [parting the bushes] Found 'em!  You kids are in _big_
          trouble, running away from home like this!
    Bart: But they stole our lemon tree.
   Homer: I don't care what excuse you've got.  _Nothing's_ going to
          stop me in the middle of this speech.  You're gonna -- lemon
          tree?!
-- Nothing except the hallowed lemon tree, 

Homer goes down to the impound lot gates to argue with Shelby's father.

 Homer: That tree's been in Springfield since the time of our
        forefathers.  Give it back or we'll bust in there and take it!
Homer2: Bust in here and take it?  You must be stupider than you look.
 Homer: Stupider like a fox!
         [tries to climb the fence; fails]
         [panting] I'm OK.
         [tries again; fails again]
Homer2: [chuckles] Don't you get it, Springfield?  It's over.  You lose!
        Now if you'll excuse me, all this talk has made me hungry.
         [bites into a lemon; his face contorts at the bitterness]
-- So much for his teeth enamel, 

On the ride back, everyone is disappointed.

Homer: This is the darkest day in the history of Springfield.  If
       anybody wants me, I'll be in the shower.
 Bart: There's got to be a way to get that tree back...hey, look!  A
       hospital.  Pull in there!  [yanks the wheel]
Homer: Aah!  Oh, great, now I'm upside down.
-- Damn RV showers, 

Homer2 rides along later and sees the RV parked in the hospital zone.
"Some thoughtless human being has parked in a hospital zone!" he says,
driving his toe truck over and hitching the RV to it.  He drives the RV
into the impound lot, shuts the gate on it, and parks his toe truck at
home.

Later that night, some shadows creep out of the RV.  "Hee hee hee, no
one in history has ever done anything _this_ clever," chuckles a shadow
that sounds like Homer.  They strap the tree to the roof of the RV.
"I'll get the gate," says Bart, but as soon as he opens it, an alarm
goes off.  A ferocious dog runs after Bart, growling.  Homer assures
Bart he'll take care of it, throwing the dog a steak.  It leaps in the
air, catches it, and continues after Bart.  "Faster, son!  He's got a
taste for meat now!"  Bart jumps into the RV just in time as the dog's
snout deforms the metal.

Homer2: Get out here, son.  There's a doin's a-transpiring!  Let's shut
        the gate and seal them in!
  Bart: Gun it, Flanders!
   Ned: It won't start.  Something's draining the battery.
 Homer: [using the oven] Sorry.
-- We eat first, then escape later, 

They drive toward the rapidly closing gate, barely scraping their way
out (they lose a bumper and a tire).  Flanders moans, but Bart is
ecstatic.

      Bart: We made it!
  Everyone: Yay!
     Homer: Woo hoo!
      Bart: Eat my shorts, Shelbyville!
Bart+Homer: Eat my shorts!
       Ned: Yes, eat _all_ of our shirts.
             [Homer2 and Shelby shake their fists at them]
    Homer2: Ooh, you lousy Springfielders, you -- shake harder, boy!
-- That'll learn 'em, 

As the RV drives through the gate to Springfield, the tree catches on
the archway and falls off.  They have to back up to get it.

     Abe: And with that, a mighty cheer went up from the heroes of
          Springfield.  They had brought the sacred tree back to its
          native soil, and though Flanders was stuck with the impound
          fee, he could easily afford it.
Milhouse: More lemonade, Bart?
    Bart: Absolutely.
           [Milhouse squeezes a tiny bit of juice in a glass]
Milhouse: [pouring sugar in] Say when.
     Abe: There are over fourteen parts of the lemon which are edible...
    Abe2: And with that, a mighty cheer went up from the heroes of
          Shelbyville.  They had banished the awful lemon tree forever,
          because it was haunted.  Now let's all celebrate with a cool
          glass of turnip juice.
-- That's why you buy juicers, 

The kids all grimace as they drink their turnip juice.

 EPISODE TITLE: Who Shot Mr. Burns? Part One


EPISODE SUMMARY: 
[Syndication cuts are marked in curly braces "{}" and are courtesy of
Frederic Briere.]

(Huge special thanks to Gary Goldberg for doing a lot of work on this)

The scene opens on the front of Springfield Elementary.  Principal
Skinner enters the double doors, silhouetted.

Skinner: Ah, is there nothing so intoxicating as the school hallway at
         early morn?  [sniffs] Hmm, school normally doesn't smell so
         rank.
          [sniffs under his arm] Ah, washbasin fresh.  That funk must be
         coming from one of the classrooms.
          [enters a classroom; groans, covers nose with hankerchief]
          [sees gerbil in cage] Aw, poor fellow: crushed by his own
         waterbottle.
-- Skinner discovers the death of Superdude, "Who Shot Mr. Burns?  Part
    One"

Groundskeeper Willy reads "My Weekly Reader" in a custodial closet and
chuckles when Skinner enters with a box.

Skinner: Willy, some time over the holiday weekend the beloved grade
         four gerbil, uh, Superdude, lost his life.  I need you to air
         out the classroom and give Superdude a proper burial.
          [Willy looks inside the box, gets a whiff]
  Willy: Gah!
          [cut to Willy digging a hole in the dirt]
         Eh, you're lucky you're getting a decent burial.  Me own father
         got thrown in the bog.
-- With seventeen bullets in him, "Who Shot Mr. Burns?  Part One"

The groundskeeper notices black liquid oozing up from the bottom of the
hole.  "What in the name of St. Ephisiocratus..." he begins as the
ground shakes.  It splits, an oil gusher exploding from the hole,
knocking Willy off his feet.

In the fourth grade classroom, Mrs. Krabappel sprays a deodorizer over
the gerbil cage.  The other kids hold their noses.

    Bart: Yuck!  What reeks?
  Nelson: [smug] Smells like one of Van Houten's.
Milhouse: It does not!
           [an oil gusher explodes between Bart and Milhouse]
           [the tiles under Ralph Wiggum's desk shake]
   Ralph: Miss Hoover?  The floor is shaking.
  Hoover: Ralph, remember the time you thought the --
           [gusher explodes through the ceiling, taking Ralph with it]
-- No Snagglepuss sightings this time, "Who Shot Mr. Burns?  Part One"

Meanwhile at the power plant, Burns sits at the head of a long table
with men in suits all eyeing him attentively.

    Burns: Now, before we adjourn, gentlemen, I have one last matter of
           utmost importance.  I need to send this parcel with the
           profit projections to Pete Porter in Pasadena.  And it
           absolutely, positively _has_ to be there overnight.
            [hands the package to the man to his right]
    Man 1: Pete Porter, pass it on.  [hands it on]
    Man 2: Pasadena promptly.  [hand it on]
    Man 3: Package to parcel processing, pronto.  [hands it to Smithers]
            [Smithers runs into the parcel processing room]
 Smithers: Forgot prende asked for highly pressing package of power
           plant profit projections for Pete Porter in Pasadena.
Attendant: Priority?
 Smithers: Precisely.
-- Pressing parcel processing, "Who Shot Mr. Burns?  Part One"

The attendant rises and rushes envelope to man at a desk.  The parcel
changes hands several times until Homer ends up with it.  He glances at
it and sprints to Mr. Burns' office.

Homer: [out of breath] Here's your package, Mr. Burns.
Burns: [sputters] My name is the return address, you senseless
       dunderpate.  Smithers, who is this nincompoop?
Homer: [thinking] Oh, I've worked here for ten years and my boss doesn't
       even know my name!  Well, that's gonna change right now!  [out
       loud] My name is Homer J. Simp -- ow!
        [Burns pushes a red button; a 1000g weight falls on Homer]
       -- son.
Burns: [muttering] Hmm, sounded large when I ordered it.  [sighs] I
       can't make hide nor hair of these metric booby traps.
-- Talk to the Stonecutters, then, "Who Shot Mr. Burns?  Part One"

On the roof of Springfield Elementary, Skinner surveys the damage.

 Skinner: My lord, such destruction.
           [sees Chalmers climbing up onto the roof]
          Superintendent Chalmers, er, how are you going?
Chalmers: Why is it when I heard the word "school" and the word
          "exploded" I immediately though of the word "Skinner"?!
 Skinner: [makes awkward noises of protest]
 Chemist: [holding a flask] Congratulations, gentlemen.  Your custodian
          struck oil.  You're standing on top of the richest elementary
          school in the state!
           [the two men look surprised and elated]
          We also found this.  [hands Skinner oil-coated gerbil]
 Skinner: Thank you, Superdude.
           [hurls the carcass away]
-- The magical divining gerbil, "Who Shot Mr. Burns?  Part One"

Burns reads the news in the Springfield Shopper at the fitness center.

   Burns: A non-profit organization with oil...I won't allow it!
           [camera pulls back to show Burns with his feet up on a tandem
          exercise bike and Smithers pedaling]
          An oil well doesn't belong in the hands of Betsy Bleedingheart
          and Maynard G. Muskievote!
Smithers: [panting] Sir, have you had [pant] enough...[pant] exercise
          for this morning?
   Burns: [getting up] No.  Let's go another twenty miles.
Smithers: [groaning] Oh...
           [Burns begins playing pinball in another room]
-- Ever since he was a young boy..., "Who Shot Mr. Burns?  Part One"

{After exercizing, the two men enter an elevator, Smithers limping a
little.}

    Burns: {Hello Lenny...Carl...Guillermo.  Hello, um, uh, er...}
           {[Homer waves his nametag back and forth]}
           {Ooh, uh...}
           {[the door opens; Smithers and Burns leave]}
    Lenny: {Don't take it so hard, Homer.  He's always screwing up
           people's names.}
Guillermo: {Yeah.  At the picnic, he thought my son Renaldo was my son
           Rolando.  Can you believe that?}
-- In the elevator, "Who Shot Mr. Burns?  Part One"

In Skinner's office, Seymour holds up a newspaper for the recalcitrant
Chalmers.

 Skinner: Superintendent, we made the front page today!
           [holds up newspaper, covering word "Awful" in headline]
Chalmers: Uh, what's that say under your hand there?
 Skinner: Hmm?  Oh, it's an unrelated article.
Chalmers: It's an unrelated article?
 Skinner: [nodding] Mm hmm.
Chalmers: Within the banner headline?
 Skinner: Yes.  [puts the newspaper down] Now, to redirect our
          conversation slightly, I had a few ideas on how to spend this
          oil money.
Chalmers: Well, we could give each student a full college scholarship.
           [both burst out laughing]
 Skinner: Oh, mercy.  Seriously though...
-- No 78th-grade readers yet, "Who Shot Mr. Burns?  Part One"

Skinner: Before we draw up the budget, I believe the students and
         faculty have a few suggestions.
  Willy: I want a crystal bucket for my slopwater and a brand new filthy
         blanket.
          [Skinner stamps "Approved" on his clipboard]
  Doris: The cafeteria staff is complaining about the mice in the
         kitchen.  I want to hire a new staff.  ["Approved"]
   Lisa: I'd like to start a jazz program for the music department.
         We've got a really great instructor lined up.  [opens door]
Skinner: [with Chalmers] Tito Puente!
          [Tito plays his bongos]
   Lisa: He's ready to give up the drudgery of the professional mambo
         circuit and settle into a nice teaching job.
   Tito: Man, it will be my pleasure.  Lisa has told me all your
         students are as bright and dedicated to jazz as she is.
   Lisa: [nervous laugh] Let's go now, Mr. Puente.  ["Approved"]
  Ralph: Chocolate microscopes.  ["Approved"]
   Otto: You know those guitars, that are like, double guitars, you
         know?  ["Approved"]
Skinner: More rubber stamps.  ["Approved"]
-- The basic necessities, "Who Shot Mr. Burns?  Part One"

Smithers: [over intercom] Principal Skinner, this is your secretary.
          There is one last student here to see you.
 Skinner: That's odd.  I don't have a secretary...or an intercom!  But
          send him in.
           [Burns enters dressed like Jimbo]
   Burns: Ahoy, there, Dean.  I understand you're taking suggestions
          from students, eh?
           [sits on desk; groans as his knee bends painfully]
          Well, me and my fourth form chums think it would be quite
          corking if you'd sign over your oil well to the local energy
          concern.
 Skinner: [clears throat] Mr. Burns?
   Burns: Buh!
 Skinner: It _was_ naive of you think I would mistake this town's most
          prominent 104- year-old man for one of my elementary school
          students.
-- Burns tries his hand at skulduggery, "Who Shot Mr. Burns?  Part One"

   Burns: [menacing] I want that oil well.  I've got a monopoly to
          maintain!  I own the electric company, and the water works --
          plus the hotel on Baltic Avenue!
 Skinner: That hotel's a dump and your monopoly's pathetic.  This
          school's oil well is not for sale, particularly to a
          blackhearted scoundrel like yourself.
   Burns: I see.  Then I'll just have to...attack you!
           [he flails like a sissy at the unflinching Skinner]
          I must have that oil.  [pants] Smithers...Smithers, help me
          subdue [pant] this beast.
Smithers: [walking in] Sorry sir, this was all I could find.
           ["fires" a stapler at Skinner]
          Take that, and that!
           [staples land uselessly on a briefcase]
 Skinner: Please don't waste those.
-- New fiduciary concerns, "Who Shot Mr. Burns?  Part One"

[End of Act One.  Time: 6:13]

At dinner, the Simpsons discuss the news.

Marge: I'm happy for the school.  It sounds like this money's going to
       provide a lot of new opportunities.
 Bart: Big deal.  They didn't approve my idea; they said it was
       unfeasible.
 Lisa: It _is_ unfeasible to resurrect the dead, Bart.  And even if the
       Three Stooges _were_ alive I doubt they'd want to hang around
       with you.
 Bart: Oh yeah.  I guess they'd probably want to be with their families
       or something, huh?
Homer: Oh, I hate my job.  I mean, what's the point when your boss
       doesn't even remember your name?
Marge: I have an idea.
Homer: What?  What's your idea?
Marge: When my father was first trying to catch my mother's eye, he sent
       her a box of candy with his photo in it.  After that, she never
       forgot him.
Homer: That's all well and good, but it's not really _your_ idea, is it
       now, Marge?
-- Homer characteristically misses the point, "Who Shot Mr. Burns?  Part
    One"

Burns watches the work on the oil well proceed through binoculars.

   Burns: That's it.  Fumble about with your widgets and do-bobs.  It
          will all be a monument to futility when my plan comes to
          fruition.
           [looks through binoculars at his own drilling site: "Burns
          Construction Co.  Building a better tomorrow...for him"]
Smithers: Sir...[sighs] What I am about to say violates every
          sycophantic urge in my body, but I wish you would reconsider.
          This isn't a rival company your battling with: it's a school.
          People won't stand for it.
   Burns: Pish posh, it will be like taking candy from a baby.
           [sees a baby with some candy through the binoculars] Say,
          that sounds like a larf.  Let's try it right now.
-- A regular laff riot, "Who Shot Mr. Burns?  Part One"

Smithers: Er, um, there's some candy right here, Sir.  [points to a box]
          Why don't we eat this instead of stealing?
   Burns: Oh, very well.
           [they open it and start eating; a photo is slowly uncovered]
Smithers: Now look, there's a photo in here.
   Burns: Ah yes, I believe that's little Maggie Simpson, the baby who
          found my precious teddy bear Bobo.  Oh, and that Simpson mutt,
          my former guard dog.  Oh and um, that's uh, Bart Simpson, he
          was my heir for a brief period, you know?
Smithers: Yes sir, I remember.
           [later, they both look ill]
   Burns: Anything left?
Smithers: Uh, only the sour quince log, sir.
           [the log covers Homer's face]
   Burns: Ew!  Dispose of it.  And, uh, send a thank you note to Marge,
          Bart, Lisa and Maggie Simpson.
-- The best-laid plans, "Who Shot Mr. Burns?  Part One"

A dedication ceremony takes place at Springfield Elementary.  Skinner
stands at a podium in front of a crowd of parents and children.

Skinner: Today Springfield Elementary embarks on a new era: an era of
         unbridled spending where petrodollars will fuel our wildest
         educational fantasies.  These young minds will enjoy every
         academic advantage [chuckles] till they enter Springfield High
         School, which has no oil well.
    Kid: [from audience] We got an air hockey table!
Skinner: Fine.  Now to switch on our oil pump for the very first time,
         here's our top student, Lisa Simpson.
Kearney: [from audience] Nerd!
          [Lisa throws the switch]
          [a huge rumble is heard, but only a single drop of oil comes
         out]
Chemist: There's no pressure.  Someone else has tapped this well!
   Tito: Aye caramba!
-- Tito's stolen catch-phrase, "Who Shot Mr. Burns?  Part One"

The camera pans down through the earth, following the well pipe to where
it stops just short of entering a large pool of trapped oil.  There are
straw sucking sounds as the camera pans left to another pipe sucking oil
at an angle.  The camera follows this second pipe up to Mr. Burns'
derrick, now lying at an acute angle to the ground.  The large sign in
front now says "Burns Slant-Drilling Co."  Burns and Smithers stand next
to the well wearing hardhats.

   Burns: Ah, soon that mighty apparatus will burst forth with its
          precious fluid.  Almost sexual, isn't it, Smithers?
Smithers: [not impressed] Ehh.
-- Burns watches his oil well, "Who Shot Mr. Burns?  Part One"

The ground rumbles and a mighty jet of oil bursts forth.  "Oil ho!"
cries a worker.  "Huzzah!" cries Burns.  Bart and SLH are in the
treehouse sharing an ice cream cone when they hear the rumbling.  "Huh?"
inquires Bart, just before his treehouse is destroyed by the gush of
oil.  Bart stumbles through the wreckage, moaning, while SLH whimpers,
his hind legs trapped under a board.  Maggie beckons Marge to the
kitchen window.  When Marge sees the damage she exclaims, "Holy
Christmas!"

The Simpson family wait at the Springfield Animal Hospital.

   Vet: Your dog's condition has been upgraded from stable to frisky,
         [SLH walks out with his hind legs in a cast on rollers]
        and he's free to go.  His legs should be as good as new in a few
        months, but in the meantime he'll have to use the wheelabout.
  Bart: I'll get even with whoever did this to you, boy, I swear it.
   Vet: Whoops, almost forgot.  Wouldn't want you gnawing on those
        casts, eh boy?
         [straps a lampshade-like thing around SLH's neck]
Nelson: Ha ha!
  Bird: [in cage in Nelson's hand] Ha ha!  [whistles]
-- Like owner, like pet, "Who Shot Mr. Burns?  Part One"

Skinner calls his staff into his office for a talk.

Skinner: I'm afraid we've got no legal recourse against Mr. Burns and
         his slant-drilling operation.  The oil belongs to whoever
         pumped it first.
  Willy: What about all the expensive stuff we wanted?  Can we still
         have it?
Skinner: No!
          [Willy tears his shirt open and sobs]
  Willy: Blast it!
Skinner: In fact, to pay for the construction and operation and
         demolition of our new derrick, the school will have to
         eliminate all nonessential programs: music --
          [Tito punches through his bongos]
         -- and maintenance.
  Willy: Argh, I'll kill that Mr. Burns!  And, er, _wound_ that Mr.
         Smithers.  Out of my way!  [he storms out]
-- A man with a mission, "Who Shot Mr. Burns?  Part One"

Lisa hears the news on the phone.

 Lisa: [on phone] Oh no, that's awful, Mr. Puente.  What?  Oh, he owns
       the nuclear power plant.  Yeah, I'd like to settle his hash too.
        [hangs up] Dad, how can you work for a man like Mr. Burns?
Homer: Well, he's not all bad.  He did send me this nice thank-you card.
 Lisa: [reading it] "Marge, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie."  Dad, this doesn't
       have your name on it.
        [Homer looks closely at the card, then lowers it slowly]
Homer: Kids, would you step outside for a second?
        [the kids run out]
        [standing up] F --
        [a church organ plays a chord; birds fly away; everyone stops]
  Ned: Dear Lord!  That's the loudest profanity I've ever heard.
-- And he's probably heard plenty, "Who Shot Mr. Burns?  Part One"

At Moe's bar, a haze hangs in the air.

Barney: These fumes aren't as fun as beer.  Sure, I'm all dizzy and
        nauseous, but where's the inflated sense of self-esteem?
         [a man at the end of the bar slumps to the floor]
   Moe: Hey, if you guys are getting loaded of them fumes I'm gonna have
        to charge you.
         [two scientists in ecosuits walk in]
   Man: Man alive!  There are, uh, men alive in here.
 Woman: [holding a beeping detector] I'm detecting over twenty different
        toxins in the air.
         [Barney belches; the beeping increases in speed]
   Man: All right, everybody out!  As long as Burns is pumping oil, this
        bar is closed!
   Moe: Damned Burns.  Let me just get one thing.
         [pulls shotgun from behind the bar]
Barney: Me too!
         [pulls gun from his side] Ah: now _there's_ the inflated sense
        of self-esteem!
-- Barney, NRA card-carrier, "Who Shot Mr. Burns?  Part One"

At the Springfield Retirement Castle, Abe's room shakes.  "Earthquake!"
he cries, standing in a doorway.  Just as the shaking stops, the whole
building falls part way into the ground as the oil from the underground
cavern is sucked out.  Several old people call out "Nurse!"

Next day, Smithers surveys the damage to the town caused by Burns'
drilling operation.

Smithers: Well, Sir, you've certainly vanquished all your enemies: the
          Elementary School, the local tavern, the old age home...you
          must be very proud.
   Burns: [stuffing money into his wallet] No, not while my greatest
          nemesis still provides our customers with free light, heat and
          energy.  I call this enemy...the sun.
           [throws a switch; a control panel appears at his desk]
           [another button slides the floor off a model of Springfield]
          Since the beginning of time man has yearned to destroy the
          sun.  I will do the next best thing...block it out!
           [another button raises a shield over the model town]
Smithers: Good God!
-- Burns' dastardly plan revealed, "Who Shot Mr. Burns?  Part One"

   Burns: Imagine it, Smithers: electrical lights and heaters running
          all day long!
Smithers: But Sir!  Every plant and tree will die, owls will deafen us
          with incessant hooting...the town's sundial will be useless.
          I don't want any part of this project, it's unconscionably
          fiendish.
   Burns: I will not suffer your insubordination.  There has been a
          shocking decline in the quality and quantity of your toadying,
          Waylon.  And you will fall into line, now!
Smithers: [pained] No...no, Monty, I won't.  Not until you step back
          from the brink of insanity.
   Burns: I'll do no such thing.  You're fired!
           [Smithers walks out]
           [Burns starts crushing things in the model]
   Burns: [laughing] Take that, Bowlerama!  [stomp] Take that,
          Convenience Mart!  [stomp] Take that, Nuclear Power Plan --
          [stomp] oh, fiddlesticks.
-- Fiddle dee dee, "Who Shot Mr. Burns?  Part One"

[End of Act Two.  Time: 13:53]

In the Simpson kitchen, Homer reads the Springfield Shopper with
headlines "Burns Plans Sunshine Halt", "Special Section: Your Guide to
Perpetual Darkness", and "Town Meeting Friday".

Marge: I must say, Mr. Burns is being awfully inconsiderate -- selfish,
       even.
        [Bart and Lisa walk in]
 Bart: Burns needs some serious boostafazoo, right Dad?...Dad?...Homer!
       [pulls paper away to reveal Abe]
        [Abe and kids all scream]
 Lisa: Sorry, Grampa.  It's just that for a second it looked like Dad
       had melted.
  Abe: Well, get used to it, 'cause I'm living here now.  I ain't going
       back to the retirement home until they fish my bed out of that
       sinkhole.
        [Marge walks to the table with two bowls]
Marge: Strained carrots for Maggie, strained carrots for Grampa.
  Abe: [whining] I want a bib too!
-- No perks at home, "Who Shot Mr. Burns?  Part One"

Homer drives his car to work, but ghostly apparitions of Burns appear
around him, tormenting him.  "Smithers, who is that ignoramus?
Smithers, who is that lollygagger?  Who is the blubberpot?  Who is that
baffleweed?  Lummox?  Puddinghead?  Beanhead?  Goon?  Goldbricker?
Goofball?  Drizzlepuss?  Fumblefist?"  Homer cries out "Stop it" in a
litany until all the apparitions cover their eyes as he crashes through
the gate to the nuclear plant.  "Just a minute," says the guard inside
the kiosk, raising the stub of the gate.

Inside a darkened Burns' office, spray painting sounds accompany Homer's
chuckling.

Burns: [turning on the light] Who the devil are you?
        [Homer has painted "I am Homer Simpson" on the wall]
Homer: [rushing Burns and shaking him] Homer Simpson!
Burns: What?
Homer: Homer Simpson!
Burns: What are you talking about?
Homer: Homer...
Burns: You're not making sense, man!
Homer: Shut up!  Homer Simpson!
Burns: I can't understand a word you're saying!
Homer: My name is Homer Simpson!
Burns: You're just babbling incoherently...
Homer: My name is Homer --
        [three guards rush in, restrain Homer, and drag him away]
       Oh, you're a dead man, Burns.  Oh, you're dead!  You're dead,
       Burns!
-- Homer gets serious, "Who Shot Mr. Burns?  Part One"

Because of the damage to the Springfield Retirement Castle, Abe moves
into the Simpson home.  Bart helps him unpack his suitcase when SLH
rolls by on his cart.

  Abe: Hey, the lamp's running away!
 Bart: That's my dog, man!
  Abe: So long, lamp.  Now stop loafing and help your Grampa unpack.
        [Bart pulls out a cigar box and opens the top]
 Bart: [seeing a gun] Wow!
  Abe: That's my old Smith and Wesson.  If you're gonna play with it, be
       careful, 'cause its loaded.
Marge: [walking in] Aah!  Bart, put that down!  Guns are very dangerous
       and I won't have them in this house.
        [takes it away]
  Abe: How can you have a house without a gun?  What if a bear came
       through that door?
Marge: I'm going to bury it in the yard where little hands can't get to
       it.  [walks out]
  Abe: Geesh!  You should have fired into the air.  She would have run
       off!
-- Abe, ever practical, "Who Shot Mr. Burns?  Part One"

The meeting at the town hall features Diamond Joe at a podium surrounded
by his bodyguards.

  Quimby: People, take it easy.  We're all upset about Mr. Burns' plan
          to, uh, block out our sun.  It is time for decisive action.  I
          have here a polite but firm letter to Mr. Burns' underlings,
          who with some cajoling, will pass it along to him or at least
          give him the gist of it.
    Aide: [whispering] Sir, a lot of people are stroking guns.
  Quimby: Also it has been brought to my attention that a number of you
          are stroking guns.  Therefore I will step aside and open up
          the floor.
           [Smithers, unshaven and drunk, stands up]
Smithers: [crying] Mr. Burns was the closest thing I ever had to...a
          friend.  But he fired me!  And now I spend my days drinking
          cheap scotch and watching Comedy Central!
 Hibbert: Oh, dear God!
Smithers: {Ehh, it's not that bad.  I never miss "Pardon My Zinger".}
          {[Ned wraps a blanket around him]}
-- Weekdays at three p.m., "Who Shot Mr. Burns?  Part One"

  Willy: {Burns cost me my groundskeeping job at the school.  And I'm
         too superstitious to take the one at the cemetery.}
    Abe: {Because of him, I lost my room, my things and my buddy's
         collection of old sunbathing magazines.}
Old man: {You bastard!}
    Moe: I lost my bar!
 Barney: I lost his bar!
   Lisa: He robbed the school of music!
Skinner: He robbed the school of financial security!
   Tito: He robbed the school of Tito!
  Homer: He can't remember my name!
  Marge: He's causing us all to yell!  [Maggie sucks violently]
   Bart: Look what he did to my best friend!
          [camera pans to Milhouse eating cheezies]
         No, my dog!
          [SLH rolls in on his cart]
  Burns: [chuckling] Oh, those wheels are squeaking a bit.  Perhaps I
         can sell him a little oil?
-- Uncalled-for jokes, "Who Shot Mr. Burns?  Part One"

SLH growls at him.

      Bart: You twisted old monster!
             [runs at him; Burns pulls back his lapel and shows a gun]
     Burns: [scolds] I've decided to protect myself ever since I was
            attacked in my office by an unidentified assailant.
     Homer: D'oh!
McAllister: Arr.  Burns, your scurvy schemes will earn ye a one way
            passage to the boneyard...
       Ned: I'd like to hear from Sideshow Mel.
       Mel: I'll see to it that Mr. Burns suffers the infernal
            machinations of hell's grim tyrant.  [flicks a switchblade]
      Otto: Yeah!
     Burns: Oh, you all talk big.  But who here has the guts to stop me?
             [camera pans across still audience]
            Mm hm.  Very well.  One last question: have you ever seen
            the sun set...at three p.m.?
McAllister: Aye, once.  When I was sailing 'round the arctic --
     Burns: Shut up, you!
-- Burns' diabolical plan unfolds, "Who Shot Mr. Burns?  Part One"

"Take one last look at the sun, Springfield!" he exhorts, pressing a
button on a remote control.  A giant shield lifts out of a mountain and
blocks out the sun.  Burns laughs uncontrollably as it does so.  Krusty
runs up the steps to the town hall in shorts with a suitcase and does
his trademark laugh.  "I've been in Reno for six weeks.  Did I miss
anything?"  When he sees everyone looking aghast, he turns around.
Everyone starts leaving in the gloom.

Doris: Eternal darkness.  Well, that's just great.
  Apu: Listen, someone's got to get that Mr. Burns.  Where is that gun-
       toting lowlife when you need one?
Snake: Sorry, I was in the can.
-- Even criminals have to go, "Who Shot Mr. Burns?  Part One"

Burns walks down the street and sighs, "Perpetual twilight, bathed in
the glow of Burns brand electricity."  He jumps onto a lamppost and
rhymes, "Hello, lamppost.  Whatcha knowin'?  I've come to watch your...
power flowin'."

Back at the town hall, Carl reaches for a jacket.  "That's odd," he
remarks, "Mr. Smithers left his jacket behind."  The camera cuts back to
an overhead view of Mr. Burns walking down the street and whistling.

Otto, still in the Town Hall, observes, "Whoa, that's odd.  Principal
Skinner left his mother behind."  Burns walks past a park bench humming.

Marge loads Maggie into the station wagon.  She looks around: "That's
odd.  Where's Homer?  And Bart?  And Lisa?  And Grampa?"  Mr. Burns is
humming and walking down yet another street.  The camera cuts to the
Simpson yard where the gun box sits open and empty atop a pile of dirt.

Burns says to himself, "After all these years, things are finally
starting to go my way.  I feel like celebrating."  He walks past the
corner of a building; only his shadow is visible.  Suddenly, he stops
walking.  Burns says, "I -- oh, it's you.  What are you so happy
about?...I see.  I think you'd better drop it.  I said, drop it!"  Some
noises of Burns struggling are heard, after which he says, "Get your
hands off!"

The camera cuts back to Marge who asks, "Where is everybody?"  A gunshot
is heard.  Burns stumbles from around a corner, gasping, a bullet wound
on the left side of his chest.  Jimbo asks him, "Hey, man, are you OK?"
Burns stammers, "I won't dignify that with a response," then collapses
on the sundial.

  Selma: Mr. Burns has been shot.
 Wiggum: Just a minute!  This isn't Mr. Burns at all!  It's a mask!
          [pulls at his face a little]
         Wait, it _is_ Burns.  Heh, his wrinkly skin, it...looks like a
         mask.
  Marge: I don't think we'll ever know who did this.  Everyone in town's
         a suspect.
Hibbert: Heh heh heh.  Well, I couldn't possibly solve this mystery.
         Can..._you_?  [points at camera]
          [camera pulls back to reveal that he's pointing at Wiggum]
 Wiggum: Yeah, I'll give it a shot, I mean, you know, it's my job,
         right?
-- To be continued, "Who Shot Mr. Burns?  Part One"

[End of Act Three.  Time: 21:01]

The music over the closing credits is somber and serious, the melody
played by a single trumpet a la Taps (over a military drum beat).  A
shot is heard during the Gracie Films music.
 EPISODE TITLE: Who Shot Mr. Burns? Part Two


EPISODE SUMMARY: 
[Syndication cuts are marked in curly braces "{}" and are courtesy of
Frederic Briere.]

The scene opens with the camera focused on a bottle of fortified scotch.
The bottle is being held askew by Smithers, who is face down on a couch
in his apartment.  He drops it, smashing it, and groans.

Smithers: Uck.  My mouth tastes like an ashtray.
           [burps up a mouthful of cigarette butts]
           [opens bathroom door, sees someone in the shower]
           [opens glass shower door]
   Burns: [humming] Doo doo doo, doo doo, dee.  [turns around] Smithers,
          wait your turn.  There's plenty of hot water for all.
Smithers: Sir...you _weren't_ shot!  [sighs] It was all a dream.
   Burns: [turns off shower] That's right.  The year is 1965, and you
          and I are undercover detectives on the hot rod circuit.  [puts
          on helmet] Now, let's burn rubber, baby!
-- Smithers wakes up from his nightmare, "Who Shot Mr. Burns?  Part Two"

The scene dissolves to a race track with 60s-style hot rods whizzing by.
"Speedway Squad!  In Color!" exclaims an announcer [HA].  In one hot rod
with Smithers at the wheel, Burns stands up with a shotgun and starts
blasting away.

Smithers wakes up.  "Wait!  _That_ was all a dream.  [sighs] Hey, then
maybe I _haven't_ become a hideous drunken wreck, and --" He stops and
sees the hideous wreck is apartment has become, then groans and burps up
a mouthful of cigarette butts.

On TV, Kent Brockman delivers a news report.

  Kent: Dozens of people are gunned down each day in Springfield, but
        until now none of them was important.  I'm Kent Brockman.
         [scene shows Burns being loaded into an ambulance]
        At three p.m.  Friday, local autocrat C. Montgomery Burns was
        shot following a tense confrontation at town hall.
         [still shots of Burns and town hall]
        Burns was rushed to a nearby hospital where he was pronounced
        dead.
         [scene shows Marvin Monroe Memorial Hospital]
        He was then transferred to a better hospital where doctors
        upgraded his condition to "alive".
         [scene shows Springfield General hospital]
        Now let's talk to Police Chief Wiggum.
Wiggum: [eating an ice cream] Oh.  Oh, hiya, Kent.  Ahem.  Uh, right
        now, we are questioning two witnesses who were in the vicinity
        at the time.
         [scene shows Lou holding a photo of Smithers at someone]
   Lou: Did you see this guy?  Was he anywhere near the parking lot when
        Burns got shot?
         [camera shows Maggie and SLH being questioned]
 Eddie: No, it's no use.  They ain't talking.
-- Bad cops, bad cops, "Who Shot Mr. Burns?  Part Two"

At the Simpson home, the family and Grampa eat dinner.

 Lisa: Everyone in Springfield had a reason to shoot Mr. Burns, even us.
        [everyone groans in agreement]
       Bart, he broke your dog's legs.  Grampa, he destroyed your home.
       And Dad -- well, you kind of went berserk when he couldn't
       remember your name.
Homer: {[screaming] Berserk is right!  [quietly] May I have some iced
       tea, please?}
 Bart: Aren't we forgetting someone...Sister Suspect?
 Lisa: [chuckling sheepishly] I was just getting to me.  Because of Mr.
       Burns, they canceled my jazz program, and my friend Tito Puente
       got fired...but _I_ could never shoot someone.
 Bart: Could so.
 Lisa: Could not.
 Bart: Could so.
 Lisa: Could not.
 Bart: Could so!
 Lisa: Could not!
Homer: [interrupting] Kids, kids, kids.  As far as Daddy's concerned,
       you're _both_ potential murderers.
-- A loving, bias-free father, "Who Shot Mr. Burns?  Part Two"

Marge: [hopeful] The police already have a suspect: it's Mr. Smithers.
        [everyone talks animatedly about how plausible that is]
  Abe: Yeah, Smingers did it.  Case closed.  Now where's my hat?  I'm
       going to the outhouse.  [leaves]
 Lisa: We don't have an outhouse.
Homer: [gasps] My toolshed!  Oh Dad --
-- It's a house, and it's outside, ain't it?, "Who Shot Mr. Burns?  Part
    Two"

Smithers walks down the street, trying to grapple with his horrible
suspicion.

Smithers: Oh...could I have shot Mr. Burns in a drunken rage?  No, no,
          not me.  I know in my heart I --
           [reaches into trenchcoat inside pocket]
           [gasps] A gun!  [sniffs barrel] And it's been recently fired.
          Wait...I remember leaving the town meeting...
           [flash to out-of-focus shot of Smithers' feet weaving down
          sidewalk]
           [a shadow walks up]
           [voiceover] I must have run into Mr. Burns outside and --
           [Smithers grapples with shadow, pulls gun, and shoots]
           [in the present] Mr. Burns!  What have I done?
           [falls on ground, weeps]
           [a giant muffler walks by and slips a flyer into his pocket]
-- Thanks, giant muffler!, "Who Shot Mr. Burns?  Part Two"

Homer sprays the inside of his toolshed with a hose.  A tow truck pulls
up.

  Moe: Hey, Homer: us hotheads here is going to go tear down Burns' sun-
       blocking machine.  You want to come with?
Homer: Sure.  I've had it up to here with these damn rickets!
        [waddles toward tow truck]
-- The perils of lack of sunlight, "Who Shot Mr. Burns?  Part Two"

{At the sun-blocking machine, several vehicles pull at it with ropes.
Otto drives the school bus, Snake, an ATV, Chespirito, the KMEX TV van,
and Willy, his tractor.  "Pull, duchess, pull!" he exhorts.  They manage
to break it free.  It falls down the side of the hill onto a town on the
other side amid much crashing and screaming.}

  Krusty: {Um, er...what town did we just crush?}
 Skinner: {Shelbyville.}
Everyone: {Yay!}
-- The infernal machination of hell's grim tyrant is laid to rest, "Who
    Shot Mr. Burns?  Part Two"

Smithers rues his recollection.

Smithers: Mmm...this guilt is driving me _mad_!  I've _got_ to tell
          someone.
           [walks into a church; goes to the confession booth]
          Father, I'm not a Catholic, but...well, I _tried_ to march in
          the St. Patrick's Day parade.  But anyway, I've got a...rather
          large sin to confess.  [sniffles] I'm the one who...shot Mr.
          Burns!
  Wiggum: [pokes head out, cocks gun] That's all I needed to hear!  Boy,
          this thing works great.
-- The wonder of confession, "Who Shot Mr. Burns?  Part Two"

Smithers recounts the tale down at the station.

Smithers: The man became consumed by greed.  He'd steal from anyone!
           [flashback to part one]
Smithers: This isn't a rival company you're battling with, it's a
          school.  People won't stand for it.
   Burns: Pish posh.  It will be like taking candy from a baby!  Say,
          that sounds like a larf.
           [back to the present]
Smithers: And when he tried to steal our sunlight, he crossed that line
          between everyday villainy and cartoonish super-villainy.
Colossos: {[in prison cell] Bah!  He was a rank amateur compared to Dr.
          Colossos!  [laughs maniacally]}
          {[pushes "Colosso Boots" button in his belt, hits head on
          ceiling]}
          {Ow!  Ooh.  Aw, when is my lawyer coming?}
-- Springfield's evilest super-villain, "Who Shot Mr. Burns?  Part Two"

Smithers is led from the station in handcuffs.  A clamoring group of
reporters awaits his exit.

 Shutton: Uh, Dave Shutton, Springfield Daily Shopper.  Who are you?
          Where are you going?
    Kent: Oh, do your research, Shutton!  Uh, Kent Brockman, Channel Six
          News.  How does it feel to be accused of the attempted murder
          of your boss and mentor?
Smithers: Kent, I...I feel about as low as Madonna when she found out
          she missed Tailhook.
    Kent: Oh.  I'm going to say "Ouch" for Madonna!
  Krusty: [watching] Hey!  That's _my_ Madonna gag.  That guy stole my
          gag!
     Mel: And _you_ stole it from last Friday's episode of "Pardon My
          Zinger".
  Krusty: Stole, made up, what's the difference?
-- Attributing the source, "Who Shot Mr. Burns?  Part Two"

Mel realizes something's not quite right.

     Mel: Mr. Smithers must have seen that program too!  He never misses
          it.  [puffs pipe] Hmm...at the town meeting, he mentioned that
          he watched Comedy Central.  I made sure to note that, as it
          seemed quite unusual.
          Ye Gods!  To the police station, Krusty.
           [the two burst in]
     Mel: I am Melvin van Horne.  And this is my associate Herschel
          Krustofsky.
  Krusty: Hey hey.
     Mel: Officers: you have arrested an innocent man.
  Wiggum: Really?  {Aw, jeez.  [pushes a button] All right, Colossos,
          you're free to go.  But stay away from Death Mountain.}
Colossos: {[sulky] But all my stuff is there!}
     Mel: {[clears throat] I was referring to Waylon Smithers.}
-- Elementary, my dear...Herschel?, "Who Shot Mr. Burns?  Part Two"

     Mel: Mr. Burns was shot Friday at three p.m., the very time that
          Smithers was at home watching "Pardon My Zinger".  So you see,
          he couldn't have done it.
Smithers: [gasps] Yes, you're right!  I remember now, I watched that
          entire show.  In fact --
           [flash to shot of Smithers's feet weaving down sidewalk]
Smithers: [voice over] I left the town meeting early so I could get home
          in time.
           [in flashback] [slurred] Ohh, I've got to run or I'll miss
          the opening rank-out.
           [a shadow approaches in front]
          Get of my way, please --
  Jasper: Slow down.  The sidewalk's for regular walking, not for fancy
          walking.
Smithers: Get out of my way, I'm in a hurry.
  Jasper: You simmer down, I'll let you go.
           [Smithers pulls a gun, shoots]
           [back to the present]
Smithers: So...instead of wounding an evil old man, I may have killed an
          innocent old man.  That's much worse!
  Krusty: {About 50,000 volts worse, if you know what I mean!  [makes
          electrocuting sound effects]}
-- Krusty's legendary sympathy, "Who Shot Mr. Burns?  Part Two"

  Wiggum: Wait a minute.  If the second old geezer got shot, how come
          nobody reported it?
           [at the old folks home, they pound on door 26]
           [Jasper answers]
  Wiggum: Uh, hi.  Um...can we take a look at your leg?
  Jasper: [pulling off his prosthesis] That's real spruce.  You like it?
Smithers: [seeing the bullet lodged in the leg] Thank God!  Sir, I only
          hope you can forgive me for shooting your wooden leg.
  Jasper: You shot who in the what, now?
  Wiggum: OK, Smithers, you're free to go.  And you...one question.  Do
          you know who shot Mr. Burns?  'Cause we are _really_ up the
          creek on this one, heh heh.
-- It can't hurt to ask, "Who Shot Mr. Burns?  Part Two"

[End of Act One.  Time: 7:15]

Kent Brockman apprises everyone of the news of Smithers' innocence.

 Kent: And with the prime suspect cleared and found completely innocent,
       we must now ask ourselves: who could possibly be as bloodthirsty
       as Waylon Smithers?
Marge: I guess it's never the most likely suspect.
 Lisa: Actually, Mom, in 95% of cases, it is.  The rest of the time,
       it's usually some deranged lunatic who did it for no reason.
        [everyone looks at Homer]
Homer: Hey!  I had a damn good reason.  He could never remember my name.
        [flashback to part one]
Burns: Who the devil are you?
Homer: [loses it, rushes Burns] Homer Simpson!
Burns: You're just babbling incoherently.
Homer: My name is Homer Simpson...
        [back to the present]
 Lisa: Well I don't think anyone in this family is capable of attempted
       murder.
  Abe: Eh...you never know what you're capable of.  I never thought I
       could shoot down a German plane, but last year I proved myself
       wrong.
 Lisa: Nancy Drew says that all you need to solve a mystery is an
       inquisitive temperament and two good friends.  And I've got an
       inquisitive temperament.  Maybe I could help solve this.
Marge: Mmmmm...I think you're a little young to be investigating an
       attempted murder.  Why don't you try to solve the mystery of who
       put that mud in the freezer?
 Bart: Who wants chocolate ice cream?
Homer: Me, me, me!
-- Abe, ever optimistic, "Who Shot Mr. Burns?  Part Two"

At the police station, Wiggum holds up a clear plastic bag.

Wiggum: OK, boys, we've got a clue: the bullet they took out of Burns.
        Now, let's discuss the, um...[picks up Agatha Christie book] mo-
        tive.
  Lisa: Mr. Burns is the richest man in town.  Maybe it's about money.
Wiggum: That's some good thinkin', Lou.
   Lou: Aw, thanks, Chief.
  Lisa: [below desk level] Hey!  I said that.
-- Out of sight, "Who Shot Mr. Burns?  Part Two"

  Lisa: My name is Lisa Simpson and I made a chart of all the suspects
        in the Burns case.  Look!  [holds up a card]
        Mr. Burns hurt all these people financially.
        Nightclub owner Moe Szyslak: his bar was closed because of
        Burns' negligence.
        Liquor connoisseur Barney Gumbel: when Moe's closed, Barney lost
        his only means of support -- sucking coins out of the Love
        Tester machine.
 Eddie: {That's a _real_ good way to get sick.}
  Lisa: Dedicated educator Principal Seymour Skinner: his school lost
        millions when Burns pirated its oil well.
        And grounds tender Groundskeeper Willy: he lost his job and his
        dream of owning a fine crystal slop bucket.
Wiggum: Hey, what about that jazz teacher that got laid off?  You know,
        uh, Mr. Samba?  Senor Mambo?  What was it?
  Lisa: Tito Puente?
Wiggum: Yeah.
  Lisa: Well, he _did_ vow revenge, heh heh.  [pause] But I can't see
        him doing something illegal.  He's in show business, he's a
        celebrity --
Wiggum: Let's roll, boys.
-- Wiggum's wind gets up, "Who Shot Mr. Burns?  Part Two"

They drive to a local Cuban night club.

  Tito: Revenge?  Of course.  But why wound his body with bullets when I
        could set his soul afire with a slanderous mambo?  Listen, if
        you will, to my revenge -- uno, dos, tres!

Singer: Wounds won't last long, but an insulting song
        Burns will always carry with him.

        So I'll settle my score on the salsa floor

Wiggum: [clapping] Yeah!  OK, OK, I believe you're innocent.  Gee, I
        hope all our suspects are this much fun.
-- Tito Puente clears his name, "Who Shot Mr. Burns?  Part Two"

Skinner's interrogation proves to be rather less fun.  He hums and haws
for what seems like an eternity.

 Skinner: I _did_ go to the town meeting with the intention of ambushing
          Mr. Burns.  When it adjourned, I rushed to the lavatory to
          apply my camouflage makeup --
           [flashback to Skinner in washroom]
 Skinner: [with eyeshadow and lipstick on] Blast!  I took _Mother's_
          makeup kit by mistake.
Chalmers: [walking in] Ooh, er, excuse me, ma'am.
 Skinner: [gasps] Superintendent Chalmers!
Chalmers: [slowly] Oh my God...
           [a shot sounds outside]
           [back to the present]
  Wiggum: So Superintendent Chalmers can vouch for your whereabouts?
 Skinner: Oh, yes.  But anything else he tells you is a filthy lie.
-- Ring-a-ding-ding, "Who Shot Mr. Burns?  Part Two"

Willy is next up for interrogation, which happens at the station house.
He comes decked out in full Scottish regalia, replete with kilt.

 Willy: I'm telling ye, I could nay have shot Burns.
         [uncrosses, then recrosses, his legs; everyone groans]
 Eddie: [cocking pistol] This is your last warning about that.
 Willy: It's impossible for me to fire a pistol.  If you'll check me
        medical records, you'll see I have a cripplin' arthritis in me
        index fingerrrs.  Look at 'em!  [holds them up]
        I got it from "Space Invaders" in 1977.
Wiggum: Aw, yeah.  That was a pretty addictive video game.
 Willy: [surprised] Video game?

Moe is strapped to a lie detector in the next scene.  Eddie and Lou
administrate the test.

Eddie: Did you hold a grudge against Montgomery Burns?
  Moe: No!  [buzz]
       All right, maybe I did.  But I didn't shoot him.  [ding]
Eddie: Checks out.  OK, sir, you're free to go.
  Moe: Good, 'cause I got a hot date tonight.  [buzz]

At the Simpson house, Grampa sits in the kitchen.  Marge runs in.

Marge: Grampa, I found your cigar box dug up in the back yard but the
       gun wasn't there.  Have you seen it?
  Abe: You accuse me of everything around here?
       "Who put slippers in the dishwasher?"
       "Who threw a cane at the TV?"

Wiggum racks his brain at the station.

Wiggum: We're still not close.  Boy!  This is going to be an all-night
        brain-buster.
         [rolls chair over to coffee machine]
        Oh, we're out of coffee!  Oh, well, I'll just drink this warm

-- With stained whiskers, "Who Shot Mr. Burns?  Part Two"

Wiggum dreams he's sitting on an office chair on a stage eating a donut.
Lisa comes out from behind the red curtain as a saxophone plays.  She
says to him in a strangely-distorted voice, "Chief Wiggum: don't eat the
clues."  Wiggum looks at the donut in his hand, which has now become a
burning Ace of Hearts.  Lisa holds up a burning Ace of Spades saying,
"This suit burns better.  Look!"  Wiggum is befuddled.  "Better.  Look!
Burns suit."  Wiggum is still confused: "I'm not following you."  Dream
Lisa becomes more insistent: "Burns' suit!  Burns' suit!"  When Wiggum
_still_ doesn't get it, Lisa says in her normal voice, "Look at Burns'
suit!  Yeesh."

Wiggum: [awakening] Oh!  Oh.
 Eddie: I had an idea, Chief: why don't we check out that suit Burns was
        wearing when he got shot?
Wiggum: Did you have that same backwards-talking dream with flaming
        cards?
 Eddie: [pause] I'll drive.
-- To protect and serve, "Who Shot Mr. Burns?  Part Two"

Wiggum looks over the suit with a magnifying glass and finds an eyelash.
"Eureka!" he cries.  He takes it to the DNA lab.

DNA guy: Ooh, nice eyelash.  Yours?
 Wiggum: No.  We need to find out who it belonged to.  We want a DNA
         test.
DNA guy: Ooh, ooh, ee, ooh, ooh, that takes, uh, eight to ten weeks.
 Wiggum: [sighs, hands him a carton of cigarettes]
DNA guy: Did I say weeks?  'Cause I meant seconds.
          [runs over to another machine, grabs a card from it; puts it
         in a computer]
 Wiggum: What do you got, the whole town's DNA on file?
DNA guy: Y'uh huh.  If you've ever handled a penny, the government's got
         your DNA.  Why do you think they keep 'em in circulation?
-- Little-known facts, "Who Shot Mr. Burns?  Part Two"

"Now it's going to narrow it down to the family bloodline," the DNA guy
explains.  The computer comes up with "Simpson".

Mr. Burns finally comes to and says, "Homer Simpson!"  Eddie and Lou
grin at one another.  "Bingo: the gunman has a name-o!"  Eddie smiles.
A Swat team bursts into the Simpson house and starts destroying things.

    Lisa: Hey!  Chief Wiggum, what are you doing?  What's going on?
  Wiggum: I'm sorry, kid, we got Simpson DNA on Burns' clothing and your
          father was identified by the old man himself.
Everyone: [gasps]
    Bart: [scoffing] DNA, positive ID -- those won't hold up in any
          court.  Run, Dad!
           [Homer runs into Lou]
     Lou: Hey ho!  Look what I found under Mr. Simpson's car seat.
           [holds up a revolver with rubber gloves]
           [Eddie dusts it for prints]
   Homer: I swear, I've never seen that gun before!
   Eddie: [grabbing a glass from Homer's hand] Then why are your
          fingerprints all over it, Sir?
   Homer: Aah!
           [Wiggum opens the chamber and pulls out a bullet]
  Wiggum: This bullet matches the one we pulled out of Mr. Burns!  Homer

[End of Act Two.  Time: 15:06]

Wiggum leads a shackled Homer into the back of a prison van and speeds
away from the Simpson home.  He stops at the Krusty Burger Drive Thru
for breakfast.

Wiggum: We need two cups of coffee, and two orders of bite-sized
        breakfast pancakes.  With extra dipping sauce.
   Kid: Please pull up to the service window, please.
Wiggum: [tries] The wagon's too tall!  Oh, I don't want to have to get
        out.  Ehh, I'll just drive up on the curb.

At the hospital, Burns eats breakfast in bed.

 Nick: [opening the door] Hi, everybody!
Burns: Ho, mer-Simp son!
 Nick: OK, that was a little strange.  Um, tell me: how are you feeling
       today?
Burns: Homer.  Simpson, Homer.  D'oh...Simpson.
 Nick: Hmm.  That seems to be all you can say.  When you were in that
       coma, did you feel your brain getting damaged?

Marge sits at the kitchen table with Lisa.

Marge: The police have such a strong case against Homer.  Mr. Burns said
       he did it, they have Homer's DNA --
 Lisa: They have Simpson DNA!  It could have come from any of us, except
       you, since you're a Bouvier.
Marge: No!  No, no, when I took your father's name, I took everything
       that came with it -- including DNA.
 Lisa: [giving up] OK, Mom.
-- Marge, literal-minded, "Who Shot Mr. Burns?  Part Two"

 Lisa: Anyway, my point is, the evidence isn't as concrete as it seems.
       Like those fingerprints: they could have gotten on the gun some
       other way.
        [flashback to Lisa in the car with Homer]
 Lisa: Are you sure you don't want me to hold one of your ice cream
       cones?
Homer: [driving with his knees] Pfft.  Yeah, right.  You chose fruit,
       you live with fruit.

 Lisa: And we don't even know whose gun that was!  Maybe somebody
       planted it there to frame Dad.
Marge: No, we can't start thinking that way about our own family
       members.  Suspicion could tear us apart.

Wiggum makes a statement about Homer's escape to a group of reporters.

  Wiggum: Here is a photo of the fugitive from our files.
           [holds up picture of Homer in "Haig in '88" T-shirt]
          And now, Waylon Smithers, uh, who's been a _real_ good sport
          about that wrongful arrest thing -- whew!  Heh -- has a, er,
          statement that he would like to make.  Waylon?
Smithers: Thank you.  As Montgomery Burns' closest friend, I am certain
          there's nothing he would want more than swift, brutal revenge
          against Homer Simpson.  Therefore I am offering a $50,000
          reward for his capture -- dead or alive.
           [everyone bustles off]
  Wiggum: Oh, wow.  Me first!  Me first!

Homer walks into Burns' hospital room.

Burns: Homer Simpson?
Homer: So, you finally learned my name, eh?
Burns: [shaking head] Homer Simpson.
Homer: [freaked out] I've got no time for your demented parlor games.
       You won't be telling anyone else that Homer Simpson shot you...
        [reaches to strangle Burns]
-- Tense scene in the hospital room, "Who Shot Mr. Burns?  Part Two"

Lisa rides her bike to the town hall parking lot.  "The scene of the
crime...there must be something here that can clear Dad."  A pigeon
lands nearby and points its beak in a particular direction: "Clue!
Clue!"  Lisa says, "That's it.  Oh, Mr. Pigeon, I'd _kiss_ you if you
weren't swimming with disease!"

Lisa imagines the time just after Burns got shot in black and white.
She remembers that his gun wasn't in his holster as he staggered toward
the sundial.  As he collapsed, she notes that his hands pointed at W and
S on the compass points -- or, viewed from the back, on M and S. She
gasps: "So the DNA was right!  It must have been -- oh, Dad!"  Lou's
motorcycle speaker crackles, "Attention, all units: Homer Simpson has
been sighted.  Proceed at once to Marvin Monroe Memorial Hospital."  Lou
speeds off, as does Lisa -- and a whole crowd of angry people.  Apu
cautions everyone, "Be careful when we capture him!  We cannot claim the
reward unless we have 51% of the carcass!"

Lisa arrives at the hospital first and runs in.  The angry crowd crushes
her bike with their feet on their way in.  Lisa stops in front of the
door to Burns' room just as police are aiming their guns at it and yells
at them.

 Lisa: Stop!  Don't shoot my Dad.  He's innocent.  He wouldn't hurt a
       fly!
        [they open the door]
Burns: [being strangled and shaken] Ho-mer Simp-son!  Ho-mer Simp-son!
Homer: Stop telling them it was me!  I'll kill you for saying it was me.
Burns: [grunting] What is the meaning of this?  Smithers, who is this
       beast that's shaking me?
Homer: [loses it] D'ohhh!  [grabs a gun, cocks it as Burns' head]
       Say it, Burns: say I never shot you!  Before.
Burns: [jovial] Shot?  [chuckles] By you?  I'm afraid not, my primitive
       friend.  Your kind has neither the cranial capacity nor the
       opposable digits to operate a firearm.  The one who shot me was
       --
        [looks around, sees his assailant]
       Aah!  Aah!  Aah!  M-Maggie Simpson!
-- The truth revealed, "Who Shot Mr. Burns?  Part Two"

Burns goes on to explain over a flashback, "With the sun-blocker in
place and the town aghast, I was on top of the world.  So I wanted to
kick up my heels and indulge my sweet tooth."  In the flashback, Burns
comments how he feels like celebrating.  He spies Maggie in the back of
the Simpson car, smiling.  "Oh, it's you: what are you so happy about?"
She holds up a lollipop.  He gasps and says, "I see."  In the present,
Homer removes a lollipop from his shirt pocket and Burns nods, "Yes...
_that's_ the one."

He goes on, "Smithers had thwarted my earlier attempt to take candy from
a baby, but with him out of the picture, I was free to wallow in my own
crapulence."  Burns tells Maggie in the flashback to drop the lollipop.
"But the old axiom was misleading: taking the candy proved exceedingly
difficult."  Burns struggles with Maggie, "I said drop it!", and in
doing so, his gun falls out of the holster, into her hands, and
discharges.  In slow motion, both the gun and lollipop fall on the floor
and under the seat.

Burns: Stricken, I lurched forth in search of aid, but finding only
       slack-jawed gawkers, I gave up and collapsed on the sundial.
 Lisa: Then, with your last ounce of strength, you pointed to W and S...
       or, from your point of view, M and S.
Burns: What?  No!  With my last ounce of strength, I sucked out my gold
       fillings and swallowed them.  Those paramedics have sticky
       fingers.
-- Not if you're a Stonecutter, "Who Shot Mr. Burns?  Part Two"

 Marge: Well, I'm just relieved that Homer's safe and that you've
        recovered and that we can all get back to normal.  If Maggie
        could talk I'm sure she'd apologize for shooting you.
 Burns: I'm afraid that's insufficient.  Officer: arrest the baby!
Wiggum: Hah.  Yeah, right, pops.  No jury in the world's going to
        convict a baby.  Mmm...maybe Texas.
-- Not if you have a lucky hat, "Who Shot Mr. Burns?  Part Two"

Marge continues, "Besides, she didn't mean it..." Maggie sucks her
pacifier, but the noises it makes aren't sucking sounds: they're
gunshots.

 EPISODE TITLE: Radioactive Man


EPISODE SUMMARY: 
At the Android's Dungeon &amp; Baseball Card Shop, Bart and Milhouse survey
the new superhero comic offerings.

    Bart: Ohh, all these new superheroes _suck_!  None of them can hold
          a candle to .
Milhouse: The only decent new one is "Radiation Dude".
    Bart: Nah, he's just a cheap imitation of .
Milhouse: [put out] Explain.
    Bart: The similarities are subtle, but many.  For example,
           has his famous catch phrase, "Up and at 'em!"
          with "at 'em" spelled A-T-O-M in a delicious pun.
Milhouse: Go on...
    Bart: While Radiation Dude has a similar but lamer catch phrase, "Up
          and let's go!"
-- Bart compares and contrasts, 

The store owner overhears their conversation.

   Owner: So you kids fancy yourselves experts, eh?
    Bart: Well, between us we've read all 814 issues of "Radioactive
          Man".
Milhouse: Yeah, and we both have the special limited-edition issue where
          he and Fallout Boy get killed on every page!

          feature film about .

will tell you in exactly seven minutes."  He shuffles his wide behind
back to his computer and says, "OK, here we are...alt.nerd.obsessive.
`Need know star RM pic'," he types.  Several geeks around the country
(the artist formerly known as Prince among them) receive his message.  A
guy sitting under a table in Hollywood receives the message at last and
puts a stethoscope to the underside of the table.  The group of men
sitting around the table are discussing the casting of the film.

          Man 1: I don't see why Rainier Wolfcastle should be the star.
                 I think we should bring back Dirk Richter.  Kids will
                 want to see the original .
      Assistant: I keep telling you, he's 73 years old and he's dead.
          Man 1: Granted, but --
       Director: Besides, we want to stay as far away from the campy 70s

           cooperation of city officials.

Assistant: Wow!  Look at that ad!

Assistant: [into intercom] Get me two plane tickets to the state that
           Springfield is in.
-- The best-kept secret, 

The director and his assistant talk to Quimby and Wiggum at the town
hall.

Assistant: All right, we have $30 million to spend.
   Quimby: We'll blow up our dams, destroy forests, anything!  If
           there's a species of animal that's causing problems nosing
           around your camera, we'll have it wiped out!
 Director: Look!  We just want to make movies, not kill things.
   Wiggum: [winks] Riight, _we_ understand, heh.
-- Say no more, 

At school, Principal Skinner makes an announcement.

Skinner: Students, I have an announcement.  One of your favorite comic
         book heroes, Radio Man --
 Nelson: Radio_active_ Man, stupid!
Skinner: Strange, I shouldn't have been able to hear that.  Anyway, uh,
         Hollywood Studio has decided to film the  movie
         here in Springfield.
   Kids: Yay!
Skinner: And they will be holding auditions to find a local youngster to
         play Fallout Boy.
          [kids all gasp, their hats fly off]
         Oh, and the air conditioner will be fixed this afternoon.
-- Those dumb ducts, 

A newspaper headline announces, "Who Will Be Fallout Boy?"  The
subheading asks, "Who will be Fallout Boy?".  At the breakfast table,
everyone except Bart is present.  Bart walks in, stands on the stove,
and delivers a line.

 Bart: Look behind you, !  The sun is exploding again!
        [jumps down, does a somersault]
Marge: Bart, why are you talking like that?
Homer: Yeah, and who the hell are you talking to?  Marge, do you have
       other men in this house?  Radioactive men?
 Bart: I'm practising my Fallout Boy dialog.  If I get this role, I can
       finally come to terms with this funny little muddle called Bart.
-- The purest motives, 

Everyone around Springfield sets up banners to welcome the guys from
Hollywood: "There's no $ like show $", "We [heart] phonies", "Welcome
film bucks (will fawn over Hollywood types!)", and the like.  The
hospital erects a sign: "Our extra patients make patient extras".

Homer flips through the channels quickly, and each person he flips past
says one syllable in the sentence, "Everyone is talking about
, y'all."  At Moe's, Moe shows a Little Rascals poster to
the bar denizens, with a young Morris Szyslak surrounded by the gang.

Barney: Whoa!  You mean, you were one of the original Little Rascals?
   Moe: Yeah.
 Homer: Which one were you?  The ugly one?
         [Moe glares]
        Were you the ugly one?
   Moe: No, I was the tough kid, Smelly.  My shtick was looking into an
        exhaust pipe and getting a faceful of soot.  Nobody could do
        that better than me.  Of course, it was kind of hard to think of
        _reasons_ for me to _look_ in that exhaust pipe every time, but,
        you know -- we had good writers.  William Faulkner can write an
        exhaust pipe gag that would really make you think.
-- Faulkner's humble beginnings, 

  Barney: If you were such a big shot, why aren't you still making
          movies?  Moe?  Moe!
           [Moe thinks back to an episode where the Little Rascals are
          playing marbles]
           [he flicks one away; it bounces into an exhaust pipe]
     Moe: Oh, no!  My favorite aggie!
           [Alfalfa runs off, looks in the exhaust pipe]
           [the car starts and blows soot in his face]

     Man: Cut!  Oh my God!  He's killed the original Alfalfa.
     Moe: [in the present] Yeah.  Luckily, Alfalfa was an orphan owned
          by the studio.
Denizens: Oh!  I see.  That makes sense.
-- Justifiable homicide, 

Kent Brockman delivers a news report.

Kent: With wealthy Hollywood people on the way, local merchants can be
      forgiven for raising their prices a little.
       [at Le Pamperie: "Giant Horrible Toupees: $1000/lb"]
       [at Springfield Hardware: "Movie Screws $10"]
       [Snake with a sign: "Give me a million dollars or I'll bash you"]
-- The new sights around town, 

The auditions for Fallout Boy are being held at Springfield Elementary.
A long line of kids stands with papers in front of them, practising
their Fallout Boy impressions.  Bart jumps in wearing a cape.

 Bart: Watch out --
        [all the kids look where he's pointing and gasp]
       -- !
        [the kids applaud]
       Thank you, thank you, thank you.  It's all in the delivery.  Now
       is the winter of our discontent.
Ralph: [gasps] Oh no!  Run!  [runs off]
        [the kids all applaud again]
-- Sir Bart Olivier, 

Mrs. Van Houten preens Milhouse in preparation for his audition.

Milhouse: [whining] Mom, don't make me do this.  I don't want to be an
          actor.
 Mrs. VH: Nonsense.  You're going to be great.  Now take off those
          glasses so they can see your beautiful eyes...
           [she does so, revealing his downright odd-looking eyes]
-- A mother's love, 

Lunch Lady Doris is reading the kids their setup lines as the director
and his cohorts watch.

   Doris: At last the world is safe, eh, Fallout Boy?
  Nelson: [too slowly] Watch out --
Director: Next!
           [Nelson walks off, sees his face in a mirror]
  Nelson: Ha ha!  Hey -- that hurts.  No wonder no one came to my
          birthday party.
   Doris: At last the world is safe, eh, Fallout Boy?
   Ralph: What's for lunch tomorrow?
Director: Next.
   Ralph: Chicken necks?
Director: We're never going to find -- [spots Martin sitting outside] --
          wait a minute.  That child has the exact qualities we're
          looking for.  He's perfect!  What is his name?
   Woman: I don't know.  He just came along with one of the others.  He
          didn't sign up officially.
Director: Oh, forget him, then.  It wouldn't be fair to the other
          children who filled out their application forms in full.
          Next!
-- The new Hollywood ethics, 

   Doris: At last the world is safe, eh, Fallout Boy?
    Bart: Watch out, !
Director: Brilliant reading!  Again?
    Bart: Watch out, !
Director: Fantastic!  One more time?
    Bart: Watch out, !
Director: Congratulations, Bart Simpson: you're our new Fallout Boy!
    Bart: [gasps]
Director: That's what I'd be saying to you if you weren't an inch too
          short.  Next!
-- The new Hollywood cruelty, 

[End of Act One.  Time: 7:29]

Bart lies on the grass with ropes tied to his arms and legs.

Bart: I have _got_ to grow an inch by tomorrow or I won't get that part.
      Pull, you mighty stallions, pull!  Show me no mercy.
       [SLH and Snowball II make a small effort at pulling]
       [they stop, and start licking themselves and scratching]
-- Mighty, schmighty, 

The next morning, Bart's alarm goes off.  He leaps out of bed, slides
down the banister, runs into the kitchen with a pencil, and traces the
outline of his hair on the wall.

  Bart: Ohh, I only grew half an inch.  I'm still too short.
 Marge: Growing half an inch in one day is still pretty good, Bart.
  Lisa: Yeah, that's how fast Grampa's shrinking.
Grampa: [walking by, his head below table level] Oh, I'm as tall as I --
  Bart: Is there any way I can look taller without actually being
        taller?
         [he walks out of the house with elevator shoes, a chihuahua,
        and a spikier haircut]
-- There are three ways, actually, 

Bart struts into the Fallout Boy tryouts.

    Bart: Good news, gentlemen: I've grown that extra inch you wanted
          plus several feet more.
Director: We've found our new Fallout Boy!
    Bart: [gasps]
Director: And he's right over there.  [camera pans to Milhouse]
Milhouse: Huh?
-- A great day in the history of acting, 

The director introduces America's new Fallout Boy to the assembled crowd
of children on the lawn of the school.

Director: Ladies and gentlement, meet America's new Fallout Boy!
Milhouse: Aah!
           [screaming girls close in on him]
    Hutz: [pushing through] Out of the way...Milhouse, baby!  Lionel
          Hutz, your new agent, body guard, unauthorized biographer, and
          drug dealer...er, keeper-awayer.
Milhouse: Aah!  Leave me alone!
           [everyone chases him back to his house]
          Mom!  Dad!  Make 'em stop!
           [slams the door to the house]
           [sees his parents opening boxes]
          What is all this stuff?
  Mr. VH: We've heard you've become a star.  We've decided we better
          start living in the fast lane.
Milhouse: What if I'm not a success?  How will you pay for all this?
 Mrs. VH: I'm sorry, I can't hear you, son!  I'm wearing a jacuzzi suit.
Milhouse: Ohh --
-- Instant collateral, 

Bart lies on his bed, dejected.

Bart: Ohh, I just missed out on the greatest opportunity of my entire
      life!  George Burns was right: show business is a hideous bitch
      goddess.
Lisa: Cheer up, Bart.  Milhouse is still going to need a true friend,
      someone to tell him he's great.  Someone to rub lotion on him.
      Someone he can hurl whiskey bottles at when he's feeling low!
Bart: You're right, Lis.  I can suck up to him, like the religious
      people suck up to God.
-- Bart deconstructs religion, 

A couple of camera crew members walk into Bart's room, smashing a
spotlight into the alcove around the door.

    Homer: Guess what, kids?  They're going to pay us $50 a day to film
           some of the movie here.
  Crewman: Yeah, we'll run that cable through here.
            [starts hammering into the wall]
    Homer: Careful, now -- [turns around] Hey!  Didn't you direct
           "Unnatural Discretion"?
 Director: [modest] Yes, I did.
    Homer: [holding his news] Phew-ee!  Woo!  Oh!  You know, I never
           walk out of a movie, but -- yecch!
Assistant: Ahem, I've got an idea Mr. Simpson.  Why don't you get
           something to eat from our food truck?
            [Homer flies off; a cloud of dust retains his form]
           Mist -- Mr. Simpson?  [pokes at dust]
-- Cartoon physics revisited, 

Krusty walks into a trailer.

   Krusty: You've got to give me the part of Crispy the Clown!
 Director: I'm sorry: you're wrong for the part.
   Krusty: But look at my range!  [holds out photograph]
            [pictures show Krusty laughing, frowning, saluting in a
           sailor cap, and looking through a microscope]
Assistant: Well, I'm sorry: Crispy the Clown has been cast.  But I will
           hire you for Angry the Crown, Silly Sailor, and Dr. Clownius.
   Krusty: I _won't_ let you down.  [the men leave]
           Well, I _might_ let you down in Silly Sailor.
-- Aware of his faults, 

Bart walks through the shooting area and sees a script coach with
Rainier.

  Coach: Up and atom!
Rainier: Up and at them!
  Coach: Up and atom!
Rainier: Up and at them!
  Coach: [annoyed] Up and atom!
Rainier: [louder] Up and at them!
  Coach: [covers his eyes] Better.
-- McBain misses the point, 

Bart walks up to Milhouse.

  Bart: Hey, Milhouse.  I want you to know that I'm glad at least one of
        us got the part.
         [Milhouse explodes]
  Bart: Milhouse!  [a leg lands in front of him]
        I didn't do it...I didn't do it!  I wished him well.
         [his head lands in Bart's arms] Aah!
   Man: Stupid dummy wasn't supposed to explode yet!
  Bart: [sighs] There's the _real_ Milhouse.
         [Milhouse rides a bike across a road]
         [a truck plows into him; its door opens and an X-ray machine
        falls out, pointing right at his head]
  Bart: [gasps] Milhouse!  [runs up] Hey, you're not Milhouse.
         [it's the Estonian midget from 1F16]1F16]
Midget: No, I'm just Milhouse when he gets hurt.  [groans]
-- Stunt doubles, 

Director: OK, let's get the _real_ Milhouse over here, under the X-ray
          truck.
Milhouse: [abashed] Hi, Bart.
    Bart: Hey.  Cool, Milhouse!  You get to be crushed by a truck.
Milhouse: It sounds like more fun that it really is.  Hey!  I think I'm
          lying on a broken bottle.
Director: Beautiful!  Use it.
-- Unaccounted-for props, 

Director: OK, Fallout Boy origin scene, take 1 -- action!
           [X-ray machine blasts straight on Milhouse's face]
 Rainier: [lifts up truck] Up and at them.
Milhouse: Thanks for the help, mysterious stranger.  Say -- I think
          those X-rays gave me super powers.
           [they stand around; Rainier scratches himself]
Director: That was perfect!  Let's do it again.
Milhouse: Uh, these aren't real X-rays, are they?
Director: Good question!  We'll check into that.  OK, X-ray machine to
          full power, and -- action!
           [X-ray machine blasts Milhouse's face; his skull becomes
          visible]
-- 

Nelson, Ralph, and Martin watch a man paint black patches on a white
horse.

 Martin: Uh, Sir, why don't you just use real cows?
Painter: Cows don't look like cows on film.  You gotta use horses.
  Ralph: What do you do if you want something that looks like a horse?
Painter: Ehh, usually we just tape a bunch of cats together.
-- Clever film techniques, 

Homer goes up to a bunch of Teamsters.

   Homer: You guys work on the movie?
Teamster: You sayin' we're not working?
   Homer: Oh, I always wanted to be a Teamster.  So lazy and surly...
          mind if I relax next to you?
-- Yet another lifelong dream, 

Homer stretches and leans on the truck.  The Teamster does the same,
only for longer, and sighs with more satisfaction at the end.  Homer
does a _really_ long stretch, then sits down and leans against the
truck.  The other Teamsters, not to be outdone, all do the same, only
more exaggeratedly.  The whole thing degenerates into a big stretching
and groaning contest.

The director and his main man are seated in an office.  Wiggum walks in,
whispering to Quimby.

Assistant: [on phone] Oh, here he comes.  What is it now, Quimby?
   Quimby: Nothing, nothing.  Only the, er, city has just passed another
           tax on puffy directing pants.
 Director: [exasperated] But I don't wear puffy pants!
   Quimby: I meant a tax on _not_ wearing puffy pants.
Assistant: Oy.
   Quimby: I'm sorry.  [sounding anything but]
-- More stringent than the "two comely lasses" thing, 

Bart walks into Milhouse's trailer and marvels at all the stuff inside.

    Bart: Wow, you really got it made now, Milhouse.  This is living!
Milhouse: [in a costume] Is it, Bart?  Is it really?
    Bart: Yeah.
Milhouse: Ever since I became a movie star I've been miserable.  I had
          to get up at five a.m. just for makeup.  I like the way the
          blush brings out my cheekbones, but it's not worth it.  And
          making movies is so horribly repetitive: I've said "jiminy
          jillikers" so many times the words have lost all meaning!
Director: We've got to do the "jiminy jillikers" scene again, Milhouse.
Milhouse: [quietly angry] But we already did it.  It took seven hours,
          but we did it.  It's done!
Director: Yes...but we've got to do it from different angles!  Again and
          again, and again and again and again!
Milhouse: Aah!  [gets dragged out screaming]
    Bart: [looking around] Yeah!  [sighs]
-- The downside of stardom, 

The next scene of the film features  and Fallout Boy tied
up inside a wooden cage.

  Rainier: Ach!  I can't believe Silly Sailor beat us both up and
           imprisoned us in his floating Aquaworld.
 Milhouse: Jiminy jillikers!
  Rainier: Uh, now there's no need for profanity, Fallout Boy.
            [in the editing room, the clip rolls]
Assistant: Everyone in town has been gouging us silly, but it's worth
           it: it's all up there on the screen.
 Director: Yes.  That Milhouse is going to be big -- Gabby Hayes big!
-- Appropriate allusions, 

The next scene is to be filmed in the nuclear plant.

Director: OK, listen up, everybody: this is the hardest, most expensive
          scene in the movie, and we only get one shot at it, so we
          _have_ to do it right.
          Fallout Boy will untie  and pull him to safety
          moments before he's hit with a forty-foot wall of sulfuric
          acid that will horribly burn everything in its path.  Now,
          that's real acid, so I want to see goggles, people!
           [everyone puts them on]
 Rainier: [tied up] _Real_ acid?
-- The perils of movie stardom, 

"OK, roll film...tip the acid vats...and -- action!"  A fire lights up
around Rainier as he laments, "Ach...only Fallout Boy can save me now."
The director calls, "Where's Fallout Boy?"  Rainier gasps as the acid
flies toward him.  "Fallout Boy!" calls the director.  "Uh oh," says
Rainier, putting on goggles.  The acid hits him full force and carries
him off, leaving a burning dent in the pillar where he was tied.  "My
eyes...the goggles do nothing!"  The wave of acid deposits him through a
trailer wall, burning his pants off as a final insult.

The damage left in the wake of the acid wave is total.  "Where in the
hell is Milhouse?" asks the director angrily.  "That one-shot cost us a
million dollars!"  Krusty is more interested in talking to the producer
about the coffee.

Milhouse runs away from the cameras and trailers, up a hill, away from
the place that ruined his life.

[End of Act Two.  Time: 15:59]

The Springfield Shopper headlines spin toward the screen.  "Milhouse
Disappears!  Move on hold."  "Milhouse Meltdown.  Ankles pic -- flick
sick."  "Spinning Newspaper Injures Printer."  Everyone in town joins in
the hunt for the missing boy.

In the editing room, a editing man has good news.

   Editor: Thanks to modern editing techniques, we can use existing
           footage to complete the film without Milhouse!
            [shot of assistant and director staring blankly]
           Watch.  [rolls film]
            [a band of Road Warrior-esque toughs faces the duo in a
           cave]
  Rainier: Looks like we're in trouble, Fallout Boy.
            [scene switch to field in springtime]
 Milhouse: Jiminy jillikers, .
            [back to cave]
  Rainier: We'll have to fight our way out.  Are you ready?
            [switch to Milhouse on a couch]
 Milhouse: Yes.
            [switch to  and Fallout Boy fighting alien
           slugs]
   Editor: Seamless, huh?
Assistant: [pause] You're fired.
   Editor: And with good cause!
-- ILM, you've done it again, 

Chief Wiggum waves a pair of Milhouse's pants in front of three
ferocious attack dogs.  He then releases their leashes and encourages
them, "Go!"

Wiggum: OK, we can all stop worrying now.  These dogs never fail.
Mr. VH: But...will they just find Milhouse, or will they find him and
        kill him?
Wiggum: Well, they'll -- when they find him, they'll, um -- [mumbles
        something incomprehensible]
Mr. VH: Uh, excuse me: you didn't answer me.  You just trailed off.
Wiggum: Yeah...yeah, I did kind of trail off, there, didn't I?  Heh.
-- Evading the honest answer, 

Bart figures he can find Milhouse by checking all his old haunts.  He
walks into Slot Car Heaven to find Otto and the comic store guy racing
slot cars.

 Bart: Have you seen Milhouse?
Owner: No, now go away: we're racing for the title of the champion of
       the universe.
        [Otto's school bus crashes]
 Otto: All right!
-- A day at the slot car races, 

Bart checks the decrepit old Spirograph[tm] factory.  A lone man plays
with a Spirograph on a slanted desk.

 Bart: Yo, Dr. S: have you seen Milhouse today?
Dr. S: No.
 Bart: OK, thanks.  [starts to leave]
Dr. S: Wait: did you know that there's a direct correlation between the
       decline of Spirograph and the rise in gang activity?  Think about
       it.
 Bart: I will.  [walks off]
Dr. S: No you won't.  [goes back to drawing]
-- Bart visits the Spirograph factory, 

"The only place left is the treehouse," reasons Bart.  The camera pans
to each of the corners, finally stopping on Milhouse on the sixth
corner.

    Bart: Aha!
Milhouse: Stay away from me, Bart.  I mean it: I'm not going back.  I'm
          not cut out to be a star.
    Bart: But Milhouse, being a star is every patriotic American's
          dream.
Milhouse: Not mine.  It's a sham, Bart!  You get up on that movie screen
          pretending to be a hero, but you're not.  The real heroes are
          out _there_, toiling day and night on more important things!
    Bart: [dreamy] Television.
Milhouse: No!  Curing heart disease and wiping out world hunger.
    Bart: But Milhouse, they haven't cured anything!  Heart disease and
          world hunger are still rampant.  Those do-gooders are all a
          bunch a pitiful losers...every last one of them.  Want
          results?  You have to go to the Schwarzeneggers, the
          Stallones, and to a lesser extent, the Van Dammes.
-- Bart mounts the soapbox, 

A helicopter with a rope ladder and someone on it flies towards the
treehouse.  A man jumps off the rope ladder into the treehouse and
smiles at the boys.

    Boys: [gasp] Mickey Rooney!
  Rooney: Hi, Milhouse.  The studio sent me to talk to you, being a
          former child star myself, _and_ the number one box office draw
          from 1939 to 1940.
    Bart: Wow, spanning two decades.
Milhouse: How'd you find us?
  Rooney: Uh, they tapped your treehouse phone.
           [shot of a pair of cans with a wire going to a van]
-- The latest technology, 

   Rooney: Milhouse, listen: you can't quit this movie.  I've seen your
           work; it's good -- very, very good.  Van Johnson good.
 Milhouse: I know I'm good.  Movie stardom is just so hollow.
   Rooney: Hollow?!  The only thing in show business that's hollow is
           the music industry.  Come on, Milhouse, you _have_ to do
           this, if not for yourself, then for the moviegoing public and
           for the foreign markets that are more important than ever
           nowadays and...finally, for me -- the Mickster.
 Milhouse: [adamant] No.
   Rooney: All right, I tried.  Fortunately, we have a perfectly good
           Fallout Boy right here.  [puts his arm around Bart]
            [next shot shows Rooney in Fallout Boy costume]
   Rooney: Jiminy jillikers.  Jiminy jillikers.  Jiminy jillikers!
 Director: [covering his eyes] We're shutting down production.
Assistant: Yeah, well, we only have $1000 left anyway.
   Quimby: Uh, there's a $1000 leaving town tax.
-- Good to the last milked drop, 

The town gathers to see the movie folk off.

Rooney: Well, I hope you're all satisfied.  You bankrupted a bunch of
        naive movie folks -- folks from a Hollywood where values are...
        different.  They weren't thinking about the money.  They just
        wanted to tell a story, a story about a , and you
        slick small-towners took 'em for all they were worth.
         [everyone looks dejected and mournful]
  Otto: [sniffles] Do we give them some of their money back?
Quimby: [weeps] No.
         [the helicopter swings by overhead]
 Pilot: Hurry, Mr. Rooney!  We've got a disenchanted little girl in a
        Jell-O Pudding commercial!
Rooney: I could play that...[grabs the rope ladder]
-- Always looking out for numero uno, 

In class, Mrs. Krabappel drones on in front of a map of the world.

  Bart: So, Milhouse, it must be a little tough giving up all that
        glamor and coming back to school, huh?
Midget: Quiet!  Maybe I can get my citizenship.
-- All's well, 

In Hollywood, an assembled crowd welcomes back the troubled production
with open arms.  An actor hugs the assistant and says, "We know you
don't have any more money left, but that doesn't matter.  Just take
whatever you need from our boutiques until you can get back on your
feet."  The assistant sighs, "Thank God we're back in Hollywood where
people treat each other right."

The camera pans out from Hollywood Blvd. and Vine St., where everyone
smiles and acts friendly, to the strains of "Lean On Me."

[End of Act Three.  Time: 21:17]
 EPISODE TITLE: Home Sweet Home- Diddily- Dum- Doodily


EPISODE SUMMARY: 
Marge bustles about the kitchen, making breakfast for her family.  She
fries eggs, pours orange juice, makes the kids lunches, serves waffles,
and microwaves some toast.

Marge: Here's your toast, Maggie!  I melbafied it myself.
        [Lisa walks in]
       Oh, Lisa, honey, I tracked down those old newspapers for your
       history project.
 Lisa: Wow, Mom.  You didn't have to go to _this_ much trouble.
Marge: Oh, it was no trouble.  The hobos at the dump were very
       helpful...except one man seemed to have mental problems.
 Bart: [walks in] 'Morning.
Marge: Bart, it's class photo day.  No dracula fangs!
 Bart: But they told us to wear them.
Marge: No they didn't!  [pulls them from Bart's mouth]
        [sees "I'm a stupid baby" taped to Lisa's back] Huh?
       And don't put signs on your sister.
        [gives the kids their lunches]
       Now, keep the lettuce separate until 11:30.  That way, the
       lettuce stays moist and the bread stays dry!  Huh?  Huh?
-- Another Simpson family morning, "Home Sweet Home-Diddily-Dum-Doodily"

 Lisa: Mom, you fuss over us _way_ too much.
Marge: Enjoy it now, because when you're a grownup you'll have to take
       care of yourself!
Homer: [whining] Marge, there's a spider near my car keys.
Marge: You did the right thing by telling me.
        [walks away] Shoo!  Get out of here.
Homer: [sighs] Ah, that's better.
-- Chain of command, "Home Sweet Home-Diddily-Dum-Doodily"

   Homer: Now that we're alone, papa bear has a little honey for his
          mama bear.  [gives Marge a pair of tickets]
   Marge: [chuckles] [gasps, reads] "Good for a three hour getaway at
          the Mingled Waters Health Spa...mineral bath, facial, massage
          --" How did you afford these?
   Homer: Ho ho, never you mind.
           [flashback to "Springfield Bentley" store]
           [Homer sits in a Bentley wearing a monocle with a salesman]
   Homer: [forced British accent] What advantages does this motor car
          have over, say, a train -- which I could also afford?
Salesman: Well, you'll notice how the heated gas pedal warms you feet
          while --
           [Homer floors it and they speed away]
           [two seconds later] -- gently massages your buttocks.
          Well, Count Homer, shall we discuss the --
   Homer: No, we sha'n't.
           [pulls passes from the Salesman's pocket]
          Yoink!  [runs off]
-- Monocles a man maketh, "Home Sweet Home-Diddily-Dum-Doodily"

Marge: Homey, this is so sweet, but I can't possibly go now.  The sink
       is full of dirty dishes, the trash needs to be taken out, the
       living room is a mess --
Homer: Oh, we'll clean up this afternoon.
Marge: What about Maggie?
Homer: I got my dad to look after her.
  Abe: [suddenly] Behind you!
Marge: [jumps] Yee!  Don't _do_ that!
  Abe: [sputters] Don't do _that_!
Homer: Come on, honey: you work yourself _stupid_ for this family.  If
       anyone deserves to be wrapped up in seaweed and buried in mud,
       it's you.
Marge: Hmm.  Uh, all right, but I'm taking something to iron with me in

At Springfield Elementary, the grade four students line up for a photo.

    Edna: Tighten those braids, Missy...hoist your flag, Dooley...
          Nelson, you look adorable.
  Nelson: I feel like punching myself.
    Edna: Bart, stop scratching.  You're messing up your hair.
           [goes to comb it, sees bugs hopping around in his hair]
          Aah!  Lice?!  How on earth does a boy get head lice in _this_
          day and age?
           [flashback to Bart with a monkey on his head]
Milhouse: We bought a wicker basket from Pier One, and he was passed out
          inside!
           [back to the present]
    Bart: Hey, how come I get lice and nothing happens to Milhouse?
Milhouse: [pale and shivering] So c-cold, so very very cold...

Skinner watches as Willy burns Bart's lice-infested clothes.

  Willy: See you in hell, you wingless bloodsuckers.
          [lots of little screams are heard as the clothes burn]
Skinner: What kind of parents would permit such a lapse in scalpal
         hygiene?
  Willy: Well, you better check out his sister.  She could be rife with
         them bugs ["boogs"] too!
-- The lice become no more, "Home Sweet Home-Diddily-Dum-Doodily"

Outside, some bully girls play keepaway with Lisa's shoes: they've hung
them up on a telephone wire.

  Girls: Keepaway!  Keepaway.
   Lisa: Hey, come on!  Those are prescription shoes.  I _need_ them.
  Girls: [chanting] You have cooties!  You have cooties!
   Lisa: No I don't!
Skinner: [over PA] Lisa Simpson, report to the Principal's Office for
         head-lice inspection.
          [girls laugh]
          [a soccer ball nails Lisa in the back of the head]
   Lisa: Ow!  [muffled] My...tongue.
    Boy: Heads up.
-- Off to the Principal's Office she goes, "Home Sweet Home-Diddily-Dum-
    Doodily"

When she arrives, her feet are muddy, her hair is messy, and her tongue
lolls out.  "Principal Skinner?  I need some shoes," she lisps.  "Sweet
Georgia Brown!" exclaims Seymour, "Something is rotten at the Simpson
house."  He dials a phone number, and a minute later, a van from the
Springfield child protection agency speeds toward Evergreen Terrace.

Meanwhile, at the spa, Homer and Marge lie in a sauna.  Marge pours some
water on the rocks.

    Marge: [blissful] Mmm...this is so relaxing.  Homey, this was a
           wonderful idea.
    Homer: [chuckles] Yeah.  If that mafia guy weren't staring at us,
           I'd take off my towel.
Mafia guy: [off-camera] Oh, don't mind-a me.  Look, I do it first.
    Marge: Huh?
-- More information than they needed, "Home Sweet Home-Diddily-Dum-

The child protection agents arrive at the house and can't believe the
mess.

  Goodman: Whoa, would you look at this place?
  Agent 2: [speaking into a tape recorder] Sink full of dirty dishes,
           trash not taken out, living room a mess, stacks of old
           newspapers -- from twenty years ago!

Announcer: Get ready, gamblers, for the world series of dog racing!
            [Snowball II gets scared and runs off]
      Abe: What the -- [the agents snap some photos] [stammers]
  Goodman: Hmm.  A disheveled and malnourished man found sleeping in his
           own filth, seems confused and dehydrated.
  Agent 2: Where's the baby?
      Abe: Well that's her, ain't it?

           Kids love that water.

At the spa, Marge and Homer lie in mud baths.  A woman's voice intones
soothingly, "All is well...all is well."  [MR] Suddenly, a man's voice
cuts in: "Turn tape over!"  The tape rewinds, then resumes its gentle
chanting.  The Simpson parents sink blissfully into the mud.

The child protection agents wait at home when Bart and Lisa walk in.

Agent 2: Children, where are your parents?
   Lisa: I don't know.  They should be here.
Goodman: Yes, they _should_ be here.  Tsk, tsk.  Those parents better
         have a good excuse.
  Homer: [walks in] Ah, I love getting away from this dump.
  Marge: It's like I'm on some wonderful drug.
Goodman: Ahem --
  Marge: What's going on here?
Goodman: Child welfare, ma'am.
Agent 2: Here's a little bedtime reading.  [hands Marge a paper]
  Marge: Mmm!  "Squalid hellhole"?  "Toilet paper hung in improper
         overhand fashion"?  "Dogs mating on dining room table"?

Agent 2: We're taking them where you can't get them!
  Marge: What?  No!  No -- you can't -- I won't let you --
Agent 2: Mrs. Simpson, restrain yourself, or you'll be arrested!
          [the kids are shut in a large van]
Goodman: Now, just relax, kids.  All we're doing is taking you to...

[End of Act One.  Time: 6:37]

 Goodman: Kids, meet your new foster family.
Rod+Todd: We love you!
    Bart: [getting hugged] Uh...please don't hug me.  It sickens me.
   Maude: I don't judge Homer and Marge.  That's for a vengeful God to
          do.
     Ned: Mm hmm.  All we want to do is give you kids a good home until
          they get their act together.
    Lisa: You don't understand.  Mom and Dad take good care of us.
           [one of her teeth falls out]
          That was a baby tooth.  [whistles on the "th"]

The police put up barricades and tape around the Simpson house.  The
parents can only watch as their children are led into the Flanders'
home.

Marge: [reading a sign on their door] "Parents are not to communicate
       with children, and must stay at least 100 feet away at all
       times."
Homer: We leave you the kids for three hours and the county takes them
       away?
  Abe: [walking off] Oh, bitch, bitch, bitch.
-- "Home Sweet Home-Diddily-Dum-Doodily"

Dejected, the parents walk inside.

Marge: I can't believe I put my own pleasure ahead of my home and
       family.  That is so like me.
Homer: Oh, Marge, don't blame yourself.  _I'm_ the terrible parent.  The
       boy bugs the hell out of me, I can't help Lisa with her
       homework...the only thing I'm fit to take care of is a
       houseplant.

At the Flanders', Rod and Todd use mini printing presses to play a game
of Reporter.  They produce papers dor "The Flanders Press".

      [Rod shows Todd a headline: "Playtime Is Fun"]
Todd: [gives thumbs-up] Go with it!
Bart: Here you go, Todd: the city edition.
       [headline: "Extra Extra!  Todd Smells"]
 Rod: Bart, I don't know if this should be an "extra".
Todd: Is your source on this reliable?
-- The Flanders kids miss the point, "Home Sweet Home-Diddily-Dum-
    Doodily"

Bart: [shudders] I hate this place.
Lisa: Yeah.  It seems like our house, but everything's got a creepy Pat
      Boone-ish quality to it.
 Ned: Hey, kids!  Nachos, Flanders style -- that's cucumbers with
      cottage cheese.
       [Rod and Todd gleefully take some]
       [Lisa takes one and sniffs it suspiciously]
       [Bart eats one, then spits it out]
      Oh, Bart, I know you're still getting adjusted here.  Tell you
      what: we'll do whatever _you_ want to do.
Bart: Watch "Itchy and Scratchy"!
 Ned: Well, I guess a _little_ television won't hurt.  [whispers] I used
      to let the boys watch "My Three Sons" but it got them all worked
      up before bedtime.
-- "Home Sweet Home-Diddily-Dum-Doodily"

The kids assemble themselves before the TV.  Ned blows the dust off the
remote control and flicks the TV on.  The I&amp;S theme music begins and the
screen shows the title: "Foster Pussycat!  Kill!  Kill!"

Scratchy reads "Nice" magazine in a rocking chair when the doorbell
rings.  He looks both ways out the spyhole, then his eye bulges out as
he looks down.  He undoes the many door locks and bolts, grabs a
shotgun, then opens the door a crack and points the gun at the basket
that's been left on his doorstep.  He throws the blanket aside and sees
a young Itchy with a baby bonnet sucking on a bottle.  His heart fills
with love and he cuddles the youngster to him.  Itchy smashes his
bottle, laughing, and uses it to dig two big bloody hunks out of
Scratchy's chest.  Scratchy collapses, and Itchy walks over him into the
house, then back out again with a TV.  He walks away laughing, leaving a
trail of bloody footprints.  Scratchy has the strength remaining to
weep, "Why?  Why?  My only son," whereafter he collapses.

As usual, Bart and Lisa love it.  Rod and Todd, however, are pale and
shaky.

 Rod: Daddy, what's the red stuff coming out of kitty's ears?
 Ned: Uh, that's, that's just, er, raspberry jam.
Todd: Dad, should I poke Rod with a sharp thing like the mouse did?
 Ned: No, son.  No sirree, bob.

Marge and Homer plead their case before the judge from 1F20.

Marge: We've always tried to be good parents.  Please!  I'm begging you,
       one mother to another.  You must have a family?
Judge: No, I don't care for children.
Homer: Well, wait a minute!  OK, I'm not going to win "Father of the
       Year".  In fact, I'm probably the last guy in the world who
       should have kids.  I --
        [the judge looks at him sternly]
       Er, well, er, wait...can I start again?
       Fathering children is the best part of my day.  I'd do _anything_
       for Bart and Lisa!

Homer: Who?  Lady, you got the wrong file.
Marge: [whispering] It's Maggie!
Homer: Oh, Maggie.  Er, I got nothing against Maggie.
-- The true sign of a loving parent, "Home Sweet Home-Diddily-Dum-

Judge: I can see you sincerely want your children back, but you have a
       lot to learn about being parents.  Before I can return your
       children, you'll have to complete a course called "Family
       Skills".  It teaches parents to listen to their --

At the Flanders dinner table, Ned plays peekaboo with Maggie.  Maggie
laughs with delight.

 Bart: I never heard Maggie laugh like that before.
 Lisa: Well, when was the last time Dad gave her that kind of attention?
 Bart: When she swallowed that quarter, he spent all day with her.
 Lisa: I thought I could ride this thing out, but everything's just too
       weird here.
 Bart: I know.  They put honey on pancakes instead of maple syrup.
 Lisa: They read "Newsweek" instead of nothing.
  Ned: Come on, you bloomy Guses.  Who's up for a big bowl of nonfat ice
       milk?
  Rod: I want wintergreen!
Maude: Unflavored for me.

In the "Family Skills" class, Marge relates the story of her children's
confiscation to the class.

  Marge: And then I saw my boy in a burlap sack, and they told me he had
         lice.  [sniffs]
   Flub: [in a burlap sack with lice] Is this story going somewhere?
Goodman: All right, Flub, we're all going to get a chance.  Mrs.
         Skinner, why are you here?
 Mrs. S: The county is threatening to take my Seymour away, d'oh.  We
         had another fight over the inflatable bath pillow.  I keep

         switch.
 Cletus: Duh, light switch?
Goodman: There are a lot of little tricks to it, things you should have
         learned a long time ago.  Such as, if you leave milk out, it
         can go sour.  Put it in the refrigerator, or, failing that, a
         cool wet sack.
          [much later]
         And put your garbage in a garbage can, people.  I can't stress
         that enough.  Don't just throw it out the window.

Bart: Remember how Mom used to microwave our underwear on cold days?
Lisa: Or the way used to call the radio station with fake traffic?
       [they both laugh, then sigh]

      could tell them how much I miss them.

       tunes.

Homer: I wish I knew something about the baby I could miss now.
Marge: You mean Maggie?
Homer: [happy] That's it.
-- A baby by any other name, "Home Sweet Home-Diddily-Dum-Doodily"

Marge continues, "I've never been separated from the kids for so long.
I don't know how much more I can take."  Just then, the doorbell rings
multiple times in succession.  "That's Bart's ring!" both parents yell,
then run down to the front door.  When they open it, they're greeted by
the cold night wind.  A paper rustles under the "Welcome" doormat.
Homer picks it up and reads output from the Flanders press.  "`Todd
Smells'.  Oh, I already know that."  Marge implores him to look at the
other side, and when he turns it over, he sees "Simpson Kids Miss Mom &amp;
Dad".  Marge and Homer look out into the night, holding each other.

The "Family Skills" course is almost over, and the agent is testing
Homer and Cletus.

floor.

      Ned: Well, children, it's Saturday night.  So, what say we let our
           hair down and play "Bombardment"?
Bart+Lisa: Yay!

and mortarboards.  They come up two at a time to get their diplomas.

         tested positive for Crack and PCP.

     Who wants to be the first to enter God's good graces?
      [Bart and Lisa point to each other]
-- You first, "Home Sweet Home-Diddily-Dum-Doodily"

Rev. Lovejoy has a couple of movers helping him move his train track.
As they reach the middle of the road, Homer's car slams through the
board on which the tracks are mounted, destroying it.  Lovejoy implores
heavenward, "Why do you hate my trains?"

At the river, Ned prepares to anoint Bart with water from a golden
chalice.  Homer and Marge arrive, Homer spots the "I (heart) your
children" bumper sticker on Flanders' car, and he growls and runs down
the hill to the river.  On the way, he trips, and bounces down the rest
of the way, coming to rest with his face in the mud on the bank.  He
looks up just in time to see Ned tipping the chalice.  "No!" he cries in
slow-motion, diving toward Bart to knock him out of the way.  He reaches
Bart just in time -- but the baptism water lands on Homer's head
instead.  He writhes around in the river and growls, finally coming to
rest face down.

Bart and Lisa run up to him and hug him.

 Bart: Wow, Dad, you took a baptismal for me.  How do you feel?
Homer: [reverently] Oh, Bartholomew, I feel like St. Augustine of Hippo
       after his conversion by Ambrose of Milan.
  Ned: [gasps] Wait!  Homer, what did you just say?
Homer: I said shut your ugly face, Flanders!
  Ned: Oh, fair enough.
-- Ned, forgiving Christian, "Home Sweet Home-Diddily-Dum-Doodily"

Homer looks toward the bank and sighs, "Oh, there's my sweet little
Maggie."  She looks to his outstretched arms, then over at the Flanders
family, who stand clean and dry on the bank with a butterfly flying and
rabbit hopping around them.  In the water, meanwhile, Homer, Bart, and
Lisa look sodden, and a frog jumps out of the water.  Maggie starts to
walk toward the Flanders, but just then, Marge walks around the corner.
Maggie reaches for her mother, and Marge scoops her up and spins around
with her in the sunlight.  "Oh, Maggie, you're a Simpson again."  As if
in agreement, she pulls out her pacifier and burps.

The Simpson family, reunited at last, hug and walk away.

Marge: So what was it like at the Flanders' house?
Homer: Yeah, gimme all the dirt.
 Lisa: Let's see.  Dirt....dirt...well, there wasn't really much dirt.
 Bart: There was a bunch of old paint cans in the garage, though.
Homer: [laughs scoffingly] Old painty-can Ned.
        [the family laugh too]
-- Humorous epithets, "Home Sweet Home-Diddily-Dum-Doodily"

[End of Act Three.  Time: 21:14]

Over the credits, Homer continues, "I always knew he'd keep his old cans
of paint."  Marge asks, "How do you like that?"
 EPISODE TITLE: Bart Sells His Soul


EPISODE SUMMARY: 
[Syndication cuts are marked in curly braces "{}" and are courtesy of
Frederic Briere.]

It's another suburban Sunday morning as the faithful file into the most
holy First Church of Springfield.

    Bart: Hymns, here!  I got hymns, here.  Get 'em while they're holy.
          Fresh from God's brain to your mouth.  Heh heh heh.
 Lovejoy: And now, please rise for our opening hymn, uh..."In the Garden
          of Eden," by I. Ron Butterfly.
           [Mrs. Feesh starts playing]
Everyone: In the garden of Eden, honey,
          Don't you know that I lo-ove yo-ou?
          In the garden of Eden, baby,
          Don't you know that I'll always be tru-ue?
           [Bart chuckles]
   Homer: [quietly] Hey Marge, remember when we used to make out to this
          hymn?
           [they both chuckle]
-- Nothing like sinning to a hymn, 

A longish organ solo takes place, Mrs. Feesh gradually getting sweatier
and more disheveled.  "Oh won't you come with me/and take my hand?"
everyone sings.  The Rev. takes a closer look at the words and observes,
"Wait a minute.  This looks like rock and/or roll."  Someone throws a
beach ball at him and it bounces off his head.  Seventeen minutes later,
Mrs. Feesh plays an arpeggio while various members of the audience (er,
congregation) hold lit candles above them.  She plays the final five
notes and collapses onto the organ.

Lovejoy is not amused.  He assembles all the kids in his office to
extract a confession.

 Lovejoy: I know one of you is responsible for this.  So repeat after
          me: If I withhold the truth, may I go straight to Hell where I
          will eat nought but burning hot coals and drink naught but
          burning hot cola --
           [all the kids recite in unison]
   Ralph: [scared] ...where fiery demons will punch me in the back,
    Bart: [bored] ...where my soul will be chopped into confetti and be
          strewn upon a parade of murderers and single mothers,
Milhouse: ...where my tongue will be torn out by ravenous birds.
           [a crow outside looks right at him an squawks]
          Bart did it!  That Bart right there!
    Bart: [angry] Milhouse!
 Lovejoy: Milhouse, you did the right thing.  Bart, come with me for
          punishment.  [goes back for Milhouse] You too, snitchy.
-- Lovejoy the inquisitor, 

 Lovejoy: [holding cleaning brushes] I want you to clean every one of
          these organ pipes that you have befouled with your popular
          music.
           [hands the brushes out, walks off]
           [Bart and Milhouse start cleaning; a door slams]
    Bart: You shank!  How could you tell on me?
Milhouse: Well I don't want hungry birds pecking my soul forever.
    Bart: Soul?  Come on, Milhouse, there is no such thing as a soul.
          It's just something they made up to scare kids, like the
          bogeyman, or Michael Jackson.
Milhouse: But every religion says there's a soul, Bart.  Why would they
          lie?  What would they have to gain?
           [Lovejoy, in his office, works a change sorting machine]
 Lovejoy: I don't hear scrubbing!
-- Only innumerable fiduciary rewards, 

    Bart: Well, if your soul is real, where is it?
Milhouse: [motions to his chest] It's kind of in here.  And when you
          sneeze, that's your soul trying to escape.  Saying "God bless
          you" crams it back in!  [gestures up his nose] And when you
          die, it squirms out and flies away.
    Bart: Uh huh.  What if you die in a submarine at the bottom of the
          ocean?
Milhouse: Oh, it can swim.  It's even got wheels in case you die in the
          desert and it has to drive to the cemetery.
    Bart: [sighs] Oh, how can someone with glasses that thick be so
          stupid?  Listen: you don't have a soul, I don't have a soul,
          there's no such thing as a soul!
Milhouse: [smug] Fine.  If you're so sure about that, why don't you sell
          your soul to me?
    Bart: [pause] How much you got?
Milhouse: Five bucks.
    Bart: Deal.
           [writes "Bart Simpson's Soul" on a piece of paper]
          There you go: one soul.
Milhouse: [sly] Pleasure doing business with you.
    Bart: Any time, chum...p.
-- The transaction thickens, 

Dr. Hibbert and his family drive around looking for a place to go out
for dinner.

Hibbert: All right, where would you kids like to eat tonight?
  Kid 1: The Spaghetti Laboratory!
  Kid 2: Face Stuffers!
  Kid 3: Professor P. J. Cornucopia's Fantastic Foodmagorium and Great
         American Steakery!
Hibbert: [chuckles] Well, what about this place?  [stops the car]
         "Moe's".
          [inside, the usual crowd sit around at the bar]
          [Hibbert opens the door]
 Barney: Aah!  Natural light!  Get it off me...get it off me!
Hibbert: Oh, I'm sorry: I thought this was a family restaurant.
    Moe: Oh, it is...it is.  Just uh, uh, pull them stools up to the
         pool table.
  Kid 2: Daddy, this place smells like tinkle.
Hibbert: Mm hmm.  I think we'll just go to the Texas Cheesecake
         Depository.
-- Where you'll be served by a guy called Lee, 

  Moe: Oh, everybody is going to family restaurants these days, tsk.
       Seems nobody wants to hang out in a dank pit no more.
 Carl: You ain't thinking of getting rid of the dank, are you, Moe?
  Moe: Ehh, maybe I am.
 Carl: Oh, but Moe: the dank.  The dank!
  Moe: [dreamy] Yeah, family restaurants.  That's where the big bucks
       are.  [rubs grime off the mirror] I could turn this joint into a
       place where you wouldn't be ashamed to bring your family, huh?
Homer: I'm not ashamed.  [puts Maggie on the bar]
        [she sucks on a drink umbrella]
  Moe: Hey, put a coaster under that.
-- The genesis of an idea, 

Bart gets ready to play a prank on Lisa.  He opens a packet of those
little rubber/foam dinosaurs that you spray with water to make them
expand, puts one in the middle of the driveway, and hops around the side
of the house where the hose is.

Bart: Oh, Lisa!  There's a little present for you lying in the driveway!
Lisa: [running out] Oh, really?
       [Bart imagines spraying the dinosaur with the hose]
       [it grows to an immense size and starts chewing on Lisa]
Lisa: Waah!  No!  It's dripping funny-smelling water all over me.
       [Bart laughs evilly]
       [he sprays the dinosaur, which expands a little and goes down the
      sewer grating]
-- Fantasy vs. reality, 

Bart: [sighs] I wasted five bucks on these.
Lisa: Where'd you get five bucks?  I want five bucks.
Bart: Aw, I sold my soul to Milhouse?
Lisa: [incredulous] What?  How could you _do_ that?  Your soul is the
      most valuable part of you.
Bart: You believe in that junk?
Lisa: Well, whether or not the soul is physically real, Bart, it's the
      symbol of everything fine inside us.
Bart: [tsking sadly] Poor, gullible Lisa.  I'll keep my crappy sponges,
      thanks.
Lisa: Bart, your soul is the only part of you that lasts forever.  For
      five dollars, Milhouse could own you for a zillion years!
Bart: Well, if you think he got such a good deal, I'll sell you my
      conscience for $4.50.
       [Lisa starts to walk off]
      I'll throw in my sense of decency too.  It's a Bart sales event!
      Everything about me must go!
-- Great selection and rock-bottom prices, but where is the soul?, "Bart
    Sells His Soul"

Bart walks up to his room.  SLH and Snowball II lie on his bed.

Bart: Hey, boy.  How are you doing?
       [SLH growls at him]
      Man, what's gotten into you?
       [Snowball II hisses and meows at him]
      Jeez, you're pretty uppity for someone who eats bugs all day.
       [the cat coughs up a bug]
-- The first signs of soullessness, 

Bart goes off to the Kwik-E-Mart.

          [Bart runs into the Kwik-E-Mart door]
    Bart: [face scrunched against the glass] Stupid automatic door!
           [Rod and Todd walk up; the door opens]
Together: Thank you, door!
           [Bart runs in behind them]
           [Jimbo blows on the ice cream glass and writes "BITE ME"]
   Dolph: Hah!  Some ice cream guy's going to see that, and it'll blow
          his mind.
    Bart: Let me try.
           [breathes on the glass, but no condensation forms]
   Jimbo: Way to breathe, no-breath.
           [Bart runs into the Kwik-E-Mart door on the way out]
    Bart: This is getting weird.
     Apu: [into microphone] Sanjay to the entrance with the Windex.
          Sanjay to the entrance with the Windex.
-- Cleanup in aisle four, 

Moe reads "Your Gimmicky Restaurant" by Bennigan and Fuddrucker for some
new ideas.  The whole bar is covered in sheets, including Barney.

   Moe: So, come on: I need a name that says friendly, all-American
        cooking.
 Homer: How about, "Chairman Moe's Magic Wok"?
Barney: I like it!
   Moe: Mmm, nah.  I want something that says people can have a nice
        relaxing time.
 Homer: [pounds fist] I got it!  "Madman Moe's Pressure Cooker"!
Barney: I like it!
   Moe: Hey!  How about, "Uncle Moe's Family Feedbag"?
Barney: I hate it.
         [outside, a truck horn honks]
   Moe: Oh, boy!  The deep fryer's here.  Heh heh, I got it used from
        the navy.  You can flash-fry a buffalo in forty seconds.
 Homer: Forty seconds?  But I want it now!
-- Brainstorming, 

Bart and Lisa watch Itchy and Scratchy in "Skinless in Seattle."  An
amorous Scratchy heads to the Space Needle on the advice of his love
with a bouquet of flowers.  He arrives at its base, stands on a large
red X, and emotes love.  Little hearts fly up in the air and burst near
Itchy, who stands atop the tower.  Choosing to ignore a sign that
cautions about throwing pennies from the tower, he removes a penny from
his penny loafer and tosses it over the edge.  It starts moving so fast
that Abe's hair flies back.  It melts a hole right next to Scratchy.

Undaunted, Itchy runs over to a souvenir stand and grabs all the
miniature Space Needles and drops them point first over the edge.  They
land in a heart shape around Scratchy, who emotes some more love.
Fuming, Itchy saws the whole top half of the Space Needle off.  Its
shadow looms large above Scratchy, who looks up just as the point
skewers him in the eye.  He runs around screaming, emoting love, with
the whole upper half of the space tower suspended above him.

Lisa laughs, but Bart sits there silently.

 Bart: I know that's funny, but I'm just not laughing.  [taps head]
 Lisa: Hmm.  Pablo Neruda said, "Laughter is the language of the soul."
 Bart: I am familiar with the works of Pablo Neruda.
 Lisa: I think we should do a test.
        [puts Bart's skateboard in the middle of the hall]
Homer: [walking along singing] Oh, doo doo doo.  Oh, I'm just walk --
       aah!
        [slips on the skateboard, gets stuck between the stair railing
       supports]
       D'oh!  Ow!  Ow.  [flounders]
 Lisa: [chuckling] Well?
 Bart: [worried] Nope.  I don't feel a thing!
 Lisa: That's creepy, Bart.  I think you really _did_ lose your soul.
Homer: [to SLH] Good boy.
        [he bites Homer's butt]
       Ow!  Ow!  Who's doing that?
 Lisa: Hmm?
 Bart: Nothing...
Homer: Help me -- ow!  Why isn't anybody -- ow!
-- The day the music died, 

[End of Act One.  Time: 8:48]

Bart heads over to Milhouse's place and rings the doorbell.

    Bart: Hi, is Milhouse home?
 Mrs. VH: He's playing in the dirt with his army men -- oh, and a white
          piece of paper, I believe.
           [Bart gasps, runs to the back of the house]
Milhouse: Cover me, Sarge!  I'm going after Bart's soul!
           [makes machine gun noises]
           [in an accent] If the Ayatollah can't have it, no one can.
           [drives a tank over the piece of paper]
    Bart: [stammers] Uh, you know, Milhouse --
Milhouse: [smug] Yeees?
    Bart: Bet you're getting tired of that soul, huh?
Milhouse: Nooo.
    Bart: Suppose someone wanted to...buy it from you.
Milhouse: Oh.  You want to buy it back, Bart?  Sure, no problem.
          [merciless] Fifty bucks.
    Bart: What?!
Milhouse: Who's stupid now, huh?  [laughs maniacally]
-- Takes one to know one?, 

Homer watches a commercial on TV which features ragtime music and Moe
watching a happy family eating a meal.

      Moe: If you like good food, good fun, and a whole lot of...crazy
           crap on the walls, then come on down to Uncle Moe's Family
           Feedbag.
Announcer: At Moe's, we serve good old-fashioned home cooking deep fried
           to perfection.
            [Moe submerges a whole tray covered with food, utensils,
           etc., in the deep fryer]
            [he takes the fried tray to a couple, who break off pieces
           and give him the thumbs-up]
      Moe: Now that's Moe like it!  So bring the whole family.  Mom,
           Dad, kids -- er, no old people.  They're not covered by our
           insurance.
           It's fun!  And remember our guarantee: if I'm not smiling
           when your check comes, your meal's on me.{  Uncle Moe's!}
           {[smiles right into the camera]}
  Singers: {Come to Uncle Moe's for family fun,
           it's good, good, good, good, good good-good!}
    Homer: Mmm.  Sounds good.
-- Moe gets into shameless promotions, 

Marge gives Bart a hug as she tucks him in.

Marge: Hmm.  Bart, what's wrong?  There's something a little off about
       your hug.
 Bart: Mom, I need to tell you something.  I kind of --
Marge: [interrupts] Let me guess.  A mother can always tell.
        [hugs him a bit]
       Hmm.  It's not fear of nuclear war.
        [hugs him more]
       It's not swim-test anxiety.  It almost feels like you're missing
       something...something important.
 Bart: [eager] Like I don't have a soul?
Marge: [chuckles] Aw, honey, you're not a monster.
-- If only she knew, 

Bart falls asleep and begins dreaming.  In his dream, he walks alone a
long a path.  All around him, kids are accompanied by translucent blue
versions of themselves.  Richard's soul and the girl with green glasses'
soul push their real bodies on swings.  "My soul's my best friend," says
one child.  "My soul's like a toy that never breaks," says another.
Lewis and his soul, and another girl and her soul, ride tandem bikes.
Jimbo rides his soul's shoulders into Dolph on _his_ soul's shoulders,
laughing and cajoling.  Sherri and Terri's souls turn a skipping rope as
the quartet chant, "Bart sold his soul, and that's just swell/Now he's
going straight to/Hello operator, give me number nine..." Ralph seesaws
with his soul.  Nelson walks up and asks, "No soul, huh?  Don't worry,
I'm still behind you."  He pushes Bart, who trips backward over Nelson's
soul squatting on all fours behind him.  The two point and laugh, "Ha
ha!"

Martin, in a sailor suit, runs hand-in-hand with his soul down to the
edge of a lake where some rowboats are parked.  "Ahoy there, friends!
Everybody find a first mate," he calls.  His soul claps gleefully.  "Oh!
I choose Martin."  Everyone and their souls grab an oar in a boat and
row off toward a glowing green castle on an island.  Bart jumps in and
starts rowing a bit by himself, only to watch unhappily as his soul and
Milhouse's soul ferrying Milhouse off to the island.  Bart, meanwhile,
can only go in circles.  "Wait!  Wait for me," he calls to no avail.
Sherri and her soul (and Terri and her soul) row by chanting, "Bart,
it's time to end this dream/And don't forget the standard scream."  He
doesn't.

Homer takes his family off to Moe's new restaurant.

Marge: [looking at the walls] An alligator with sunglasses?  Hah!  Now
       I've seen everything.
  Moe: Hiya, folks.  Welcome to Uncle Moe's.  [to the kids] Aw, look at
       the cute little minors.
Homer: Wow, that's Moe -- the guy from the ad!
  Moe: Right this way, Homer.
Homer: [gasps] He knows my name!
Marge: Street signs?  Indoors?  Ha ha, whatever!
-- Striking originality, 

Flanders and his family are seated elsewhere.

   Ned: Rod, you order anything you want for your big ten-oh.
   Rod: Million dollar birthday fries!
Waiter: [gleeful] Uh oh!
         [a flashing light and siren go off]
 Maude: [reading] "Moe gets so excited when you order his million dollar
        birthday fries, he just has to celebrate.
         [Moe jumps out with sparklers and fries on his head in a
        basket]
   Moe: Here you go!  Here I am!
        Uncle Moe -- thank you, ma'am!
        This'll be a treat:
        Uncle Moe!  Here I am, while you eat!
         [leans down; Rod tries a couple of fries]
   Moe: Please take the fries off my head, kid.  The basket is extremely
        hot.
-- The agony of hot cooking oil, 

Moe personally waits on Homer's table.

 Lisa: How are the southwestern pizza fingers?
  Moe: They're, um...[reads] "awesomely outrageous".
Marge: Oh, these look good: guilt-free steakfish filets.
  Moe: Nah, nah, let me level with you, Marge: that's just our name for
       bottom-feeding suction eel.  You don't want that.
Marge: Oh...
  Moe: Why don't you try...Moe's hobo chicken chili.  I start with the
       best part -- the neck -- and then I add secret hobo spices.
Marge: Ooh.  Tres bien.
  Moe: Yeah.
        [Ralph squirts Moe with a squirt gun and laughs]
       Hey, what the hell are you doing, you little freak?
        [Ralph starts bawling]
  Moe: [apologetic] Ooh, sorry, kid, sorry.  I'm not used to the
       laughter of children.  It cuts through me like a dentist drill.
       But no, no, that was funny, that was funny taking away my dignity
       like that, ha ha ha.
-- Moe, always appreciative of a good joke, 

         Lisa: I would like to say grace.  Ahem.
               Lord, have mercy on my soul...and Mom's soul...and Dad's
               soul...and Maggie's soul...and let every _soul_ in
               Christendom --
                [Bart throws a fry at Lisa]
        Marge: Bart!
         Bart: I can't _take_ this any more.  I want my soul, and I want
               it now!  [runs out]
        Homer: Bart, you didn't finish your spaghetti and Moe balls!
Homer's brain: Silence, you fool.  It can be ours!
        Homer: [eating] Run, boy!  Run!  Run for your life, boy!
-- Truly, an evil scheme, 

[End of Act Two.  Time: 14:06]

Bart pounds his fist on Milhouse's door.

 Bart: Milhouse...Milhouse!  You win.  I want this nightmare to end!
        [a space-suited figure answers the door]
Robot: Leave this place.  You are in great danger.
 Bart: [fearful] Where's Milhouse?
Robot: The one you call Milhouse is gone.
        [takes helmet off]
  Man: He went to his grandma's place while we're spraying for potato
       bugs.
        [camera pulls back to show house covered by a tent]
 Bart: Oh.  When Milhouse left, did you notice if he was carrying a
       piece of paper?
  Man: Oh, yeah.  You don't forget a thing like that.
-- An eye for detail, 

At Moe's, the million-dollar birthday fries siren goes off again.  Moe
sighs heavily, uses the Lord's name in vain, and goes into his spiel.

     Moe: [sighs] Here you go!  Here I am!
          Uncle Moe -- thank you, ma'am!
          This'll be a treat:
          Uncle Moe!  Here I am, while you eat!
  Sherri: Yay!  Now do it for Terri.
     Moe: What, it's your birthday too?
Together: We're twins.
     Moe: [sighs] Here you go, here I am.  Eat your fries, eat them.
           [puts them on the table and leaves]
     Kid: Here's you.  [gives Moe a drawing] [PH]
     Moe: [looking at it] Aw, jeez.  And you got the stink lines, and
          everything.
           [gives Snake his bill]
   Snake: Ho, dude: you did _not_ smile.  We eat for free.  Come on,
          Shoshanna, let's roll.
     Moe: But I sang you the potato stuffings.  Come on!  I sang you the
          potato stuffings.
  Krusty: Look at the vein on that guy's forehead.  He's gonna blow!
-- Just like Krakatoa, 

Moe's left eyelid flickers involuntarily, dangerously.

Child: Unky Moe?
  Moe: [trying hard for control] Whaaat...is it, sweetheart?
Child: My sodie is too cold.  My teef hurt!
  Moe: [mock sympathy] Oh, your "teef" hurt, huh?  Your "teef" hurt?
       Well that's too freaking bad!  You hear me?  I'll tell you where
       you can put your freaking sodie too!
        [everyone gasps]
        [Maude covers Todd's ears]
 Todd: Ow, my freaking ears!
Maude: [gasps] Oh, let's go, dear.
  Ned: Well, I expect that type of language at Denny's, but not here!
        [everyone leaves en masse]
  Moe: Aw, come on, folks.  Wait, please come back!  Please, I got a new
       offer: whenever Uncle Moe threatens you, you get a free steak...
       fish.
-- No one takes the, er, bait, 

Moe sighs heavily as his last customer walks out the door and slams it.

Bart stops on his bike to look at a map.  "OK, OK.  Milhouse's
grandmother lives on 257th St., and I'm on 3rd."  He jumps out the way
just in time as a large street cleaner rolls over his bike.
Miraculously, the bike gets spit out shining like new.  "Well, finally!
A little luck," grins Bart, hopping on and starting to pedal.  Two
strokes later, the thing collapses around him.  The street cleaner
driver laughs at Bart, all the way down the stairs of the 3rd St. subway
station, right to the crash at the bottom.  Bart starts the long jog.

At 181st and King, a derelict wanders around talking incomprehensibly
fast.  Chief Wiggum pulls up in a squad car with Ralph riding shotgun.

Wiggum: Son, you wait here while Daddy tries to talk some sense into
        this raving derelict.
         [the man raves as Wiggum walks up]
Wiggum: [motioning] Slow down, slow down.
         [the man raves some more, something about "Albert Hitchcock
        stole every idea I ever had"]
        {_Who's_ been stealing your thoughts?}
        {[the man raves some more, something about "The Olde Curiosity
        Shoppe" and "John Gielgud"]}
         [Bart opens the squad car door]
  Bart: Hello, Ralph.
 Ralph: Aah!  Um, hi, Bart.  I know you from school.
  Bart: Yes.  A simple proposition, Ralph: how would you like to make a
        dollar?
 Ralph: Uh...I don't know.
  Bart: All you have to do is sign a paper that says I can have your
        soul.  [desperate] I need a soul, Ralph -- any soul.  Yours!
         [Ralph starts bawling]
Wiggum: [shining a flashlight] Hey, what's going on over there?
         [Bart hisses; he runs off into the mist and vanishes]
-- A vampire in Springfield, 

The regular crowd sits in Moe's once again.  The restaurant is in the
final stages of being taken apart by some other guys.

   Moe: Go on, take it all.  Get it all out of here.
Barney: You know, Moe, you might want to keep the fire extinguishers.
   Moe: Nah.  Too many bad memories.
Barney: {Well, look at the bright side, Moe: you still got us.}
   Moe: {Yeah.  Yeah, you know, that -- that actually makes me feel a
        little better.}
 Homer: {Why?  That was the problem in the first place: you were going
        broke because we were your only customers.  Wasn't that the
        problem in the first place?  That you were going broke?  Moe?
        Moe?  Hey, Moe.  Oh!  You're thinking about all the money you
        blew, aren't you.  [Moe nods] What was it?  Fifty, sixty
        thousand dollars?
        Moe, look: maybe it would help if you went over all the mistakes
        you made from the beginning.  Moe?}
   Moe: {[exasperated] What?!}
 Homer: {Let me get a pen.}
-- Kwyjibo brain slowness alert, 

At Milhouse's grandmother's place, the parents sleep on a double sofa
bed and Milhouse on a fold-out cot.  Bart knocks on the door.

 Grandma: A caller at this hour?  [to Mr. VH] You dial 9-1, then when I
          say so, dial 1 again.  [opens the door] [TM]
    Bart: [sees Milhouse, sighs with relief] Milhouse, please.
Milhouse: Bart, I can't play now.  It's 2:00 a.m.
    Bart: Milhouse, I've _got_ to have my soul back.  I'll do anything
          you want.
Milhouse: Uh...well...
  Mr. VH: Uh, Milhouse, give him back his soul!  I've got work tomorrow.
Milhouse: I'm really sorry...I kind of traded your soul to the guy at
          the comic book store.  But look!  I got some cool pogs: [shows
          them] Alf pogs!  Remember Alf?  He's back...in pog form.
    Bart: [incredulous] You traded my soul for pogs?!
           [runs out screaming]
 Grandma: Close that door!  You're letting the heat out.
  Mr. VH: Shut up, shut up, shut up!
-- 

Bart decides to sleep in from of the comic book guy's store that night.
In the morning, the owner arrives.

Owner: If you are waiting for the Hi &amp; Lois signing, it has been moved
       to the Springfield Coliseum.
 Bart: Please, you have something of mine on a little piece of paper.
Owner: Oh, so you're Bart Simpson, eh?  Well, since my breakfast burrito
       is congealing rapidly, I will be blunt: you're too late.  I sold
       your soul last night.
        [Bart looks worried]
       Yes, yes: I found a buyer right away for _that_ item.
 Bart: Who?
Owner: I am not at liberty to divulge the party, but they were most
       interested in having possession of Little Boy's soul.
        [Bart bangs his head]
       Um, excuse me: no banging your head on the display case, please.
       It contains a very rare Mary Worth in which she has advised a
       friend to commit suicide.  Thank you.  [eats burrito]
-- Too bad that friend wasn't Rex Morgan M.D., 

Bart walks home in the rain, dejected.  He enters his room and gets on
his knees.

Bart: [plaintive] Are you there, God?  It's me, Bart Simpson.  I know I
      never paid too much attention in church, but I could really use
      some of that good stuff now.  I'm...afraid.  I'm afraid some
      weirdo's got my soul and I don't know what they're doing to it!  I
      just want it back.  Please?  [starts to cry] I hope you can hear
      this.
       [his soul floats down from above]
       [he grabs it and hugs it, and sees Lisa standing there]
      Lisa?  _You_ bought this?
Lisa: With the change in my piggy bank.
Bart: There's no change in your piggy bank.
Lisa: Not in any of the ones _you_ know about.
Bart: Oh, Lis, thank you.  [kisses her]
Lisa: Happy to do it.  But you know, Bart, some philosophers believe
      that nobody is born with a soul -- that you have to earn one [Bart
      eats the piece of paper] through suffering and thought and prayer,
      like you did last night.
Bart: Uh huh.  [swallows]
-- Word to the wise, 

Bart sleeps with a little smile on his face that night, the family pets
curled up on his bed with him.  In his dream, he and his soul row toward
the green castle on the island.  He hears Martin nearby, "Hah!  It's
like punting on the Thames.  Stroke!  Stroke!"  He and his soul glance
slyly at one another, then steer their boat into Martin's.  Martin's
soul gets knocked over the side.  Bart and his soul laugh and continue
on their way, chuckling.

 EPISODE TITLE: Lisa the Vegetarian


EPISODE SUMMARY:  (courtesy of Gary Goldberg)
[Syndication cuts are marked in curly braces "{}" and are courtesy of
Frederic Briere.]

Scene opens with family including Grampa in car driving towards
Storytown Village.

Grampa: [Whiny] Are we there yet?
 Homer: No.
Grampa: Are we there yet?
 Homer: No.
Grampa: Are we there yet?
 Homer: No.
Grampa: Where are we going?
  Lisa: [Derisively] We're going to Storytown Village, Grampa.  It's an
        amusement park for babies.
Grampa: Ooooh.  Just leave me in the car with the window open a crack.
 Homer: That's the plan!
 Marge: I think it's nice we're doing something Maggie will enjoy for
        once.  Besides, I'm sure Storytown Village is also fun for
        everyone, from eight [points at Lisa] to ...God only knows.
        [points at Grampa.]
-- X, where X is greater than sixty, 

Arrival at Storytown Village, "Fun for ages 1 to 7 1/2".  Everyone
groans.

The family approaches the "Three Little Pigs" amusement.  A mechanical
wolf and three mechanical pigs perform drolly.

 Wolf: Come out, come out, or I'll bloooow your house in.
 Pigs: Not by the hairs of our chinny chin chin.
 Bart: What a load of crappy crap crap.
Homer: Quiet, boy.  I have a feeling some bad stuff is going to go down.
Marge: [To Maggie] This is where the wolf blows down the pigs house.
 Bart: [Sarcastically] He blows all right, he blows big time.
Marge: That's it honey, get into the spirit.
-- Marge, characteristically, misinterprets slang, 

The wolf blows feebly, and the house tilts backwards equally feebly.
Maggie claps her hands in enthusiasm.

Homer: That was good, but not great.
-- Homer reacts to the wolf blowing the pigs' house down, "Lisa the
    Vegetarian"

{Scene shifts to the interior of the Three Bears house.}

Father Bear: {Somebody's been sleeping in my bed.  }
Mother Bear: {[Distorted due to technical problems]}
  Baby Bear: {Somebody's been sleeping in my bed.  }
     Grampa: {[Looking out from Baby's bed] Welll, I'm sorry but it was
             150 degrees in the car.}
-- Abe wrecks "Goldilocks", 

{Bart approaches the Toddlerville TrollEy.  A green elf says "You must
be shorter then this to ride."  Bart limbos under the elf's arm and
boards a train car.  He laughs evilly, "So long, suck --" when his face
hits the tunnel opening and pushes the tunnel along, uprooting poles and
trees until the tunnel and train hit Paul Bunyan's statue.  Paul Bunyan
falls over and his axe chops Mother Goose's head off.  All the children
on the train cheer.}

Scene shifts to family in "Little Bo Peep's Petting Zoo".  Homer is
waving a can in a goat's face while Marge and Maggie watch.

Homer: Come on, eat the can!  Come on!
Marge: You're supposed to feed them pellets from the machine over there.
-- Homer tests the appetite of a goat, 

Marge carries Maggie over to the pellet machine, puts her on the ground,
and turns the crank.  A rush of pellets covers Maggie.  The animals all
look up and rush over to eat the grain, leaving only a spinning
pacifier.  "Oh, my," Marge says worriedly.  Marge looks over at the
animals one at a time, until she spys a llama using a hind leg to
scratch Maggie out of its fur.  Marge runs over and picks Maggie up.

The family approach a lamb.  "Aw," they sigh, observing its cuteness.
They look to the right at a smaller, cuter lamb, and sigh longer.  Still
further to the right is the absolute cutest lamb of them all, and the
family sigh most wistfully.

The largest lamb strolls in front of the smallest lamb.  Homer knocks it
out of the way.  "Out of the way, you!"  Spying the cutest lamb again,
he sighs.

Lisa pets the smallest lamb.

 Lisa: Ooohh, you are SO cute, yes you are you are I just LOVE you.
Marge: [Laughs] See.  It was a good idea to come here after all.
-- The up-side to everything, 

Mother Goose's voice comes over the loudspeaker above them.

Mother Goose: Attention familes.  This is Mother Goose.  The following
              cars have been broken into...
-- Thieves work the kiddie park, 

The family pulls into their garage.  Homer hears sounds of a large party
coming from the Flanders.  A sign over the festivities says "The
Flanders Family Reunion BBQ.  Ned is calling the square dancing cadence
while the rest of the family claps and dances.  The family members all
look strikingly alike.

       Homer: Hey Flanders!
All Flanders: Hidely-ho, neighborino!
       Homer: Shut up!
All Flanders: Okily-dokily!
       Homer: Ned!  You're having a family reunion and you didn't invite
              me!?
         Ned: Oh, gosh Homer.  This is strictly a Flanders affair.  I've
              got family here from around the globe.  [Points out one
              relative.]  Here's Jose Flanders.
        Jose: Buenos Ding dong didlyos, senor.
         Ned: And this is Lord Thistlewick Flanders.
 Thistlewick: Charmed.  [Ned nudges him in the back.]  Eh, a googily...
              doogily.
       Homer: I can't believe you didn't invite me.  [Squints eyes.]
              After I painted those cool stripes all over your car.
              [Snaps fingers.]  I know!  I'll throw my own barbeque.
              The greatest barbeque this town has ever seen, and I'll
              only invite who I want.  That'll show you.
         Ned: Can I come?
       Homer: Sure.  [Turns away.]  D'oh!
-- Mouth before brain, 

Scene switches to family gathered around dinner table.

Homer: This barbeque will be hard, thankless work.  But I'm sure you're
       up to it, Marge.
Marge: Well, it could be a good chance to get to know our neighbors
       outside of a courtroom setting.
Homer: You know what you should serve Marge?  More of these lamb chops.
       These are the best ever.
Marge: Why, thank you Homey!  You might say the secret ingredient is...
       salt.
-- As opposed to love or cough syrup, 

The family begins to chew.  Lisa sees a vision of the baby lamb appear
before her, missing the lamb chops on her plate.

 Lamb: [In a baaa-ful voice...] Please Lisa, I thought you loved me,
       loved me.
Marge: What's wrong, Lisa?  Didn't you get enough lamb chops?  [Places
       more on her plate.]
 Lisa: I can't eat this.  I can't eat a poor little lamb.  [Pushes her
       plate away.]
Homer: Lisa, get a hold of yourself.  This is lamb, not _a_ lamb.
 Lisa: What's the difference between this lamb and the one that kissed
       me?
 Bart: This one spent two hours in the broiler.  [Takes a big chomp.]
Marge: Bart!  Sensible bites!  All right, Lisa, if you don't want lamb
       chops, there are lots of other things I can make.  Chicken
       breast.  Rump roast.  Hot dogs.
-- Meat, wonderful meat, 

Each forms an image in Lisa's mind.  The corresponding part falls off
onto a plate.

 Lisa: No I can't!  I can't eat any of them!
Homer: Wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute.  Lisa honey, are you
       saying you're *never* going to eat any animal again?  What about
       bacon?
 Lisa: No.
Homer: Ham?
 Lisa: No.
Homer: Pork chops?
 Lisa: Dad!  Those all come from the same animal!
Homer: [Chuckles] Yeah, right Lisa.  A wonderful, magical animal.
-- Of species porcine, 

Bart quips, "I think Lisa's right Dad.  Eating meat is baaaaaad."  Lisa
smacks the chop out of Bart's hand and into Homer's mouth.  "Hey!
That's my chop!"  Bart cries.  Bart and Homer growl and fight for the
lamp chop between them.  Lisa rolls her eyes.

[End of Act One.  Time: 5:22]

At Springfield Elementary.  Lisa's in class bemoaning her problem.

  Lisa: Ohhh, my family just doesn't understand my new found
        vegetarianism.  Compared to them the public schools are a haven
        of enlightenment.
Hoover: Okay class, time to dissect our worms.  [Class cheers.  Miss
        Hoover places a worm in a pan before Lisa.]  First pin them down
        so they don't fly up and hit you in the eye.
 Ralph: Umm, Miss Hoover?
Hoover: Yes Ralph, what is it?
 Ralph: My worm went in my mouth and then I ate it...can I have another
        one?
Hoover: No Ralph, there aren't any more...[shaking her head] just try to
        sleep while the other children are learning.
 Ralph: Oh boy...sleep!  That's where I'm a viking!
-- Erik the Ralph, almost, 

Lisa looks down at the wriggling worm.

Worm: Leeesaaaa, Whaaat did I ever do to yoooooou?
Lisa: Why does it talk like a lamb?
-- Lamb, worm...they kind of rhyme, 

Lisa picks up her knife and brings it closer to the worm, struggles with
her conscious, then puts the knife down.

  Lisa: Uhh, Miss Hoover?  I don't think I can dissect an animal.  I
        think it's wrong.
Hoover: Okay Lisa, I respect your moral objection.
         [Presses the "Independent Thought Alarm" button under her
        desk.]
-- Respect, but not condone, 

Scene shifts to cafeteria lunch line.  Such appetizing entrees as
"Giblet McNiblets", "Salibury Balls" and "Cows Legs" are featured.

 Lisa: Uhh, excuse me?  Isn't there anything here that doesn't have meat
       in it?
Doris: Possibly the meat loaf.
 Lisa: Well, I believe you're required to provide a vegetarian
       alternative.
Doris: [Picks up a hot dog in a bun, shakes the weiner out, and slaps
       the bun down on Lisa's tray.]  Yum.  It's rich in bunly goodness.
 Lisa: [Drolly.]  Do you remember when you lost your passion for this
       work?
-- Some time before the Alamo, methinks, 

Lunchlady Doris removes the cigarette from her mouth, reaches under the
counter and presses the "independent Thought Alarm" button.  Cut to
Principal Skinner in his office.

Skinner: Oh oh.  Two independent thought alarms in one day.  The
         students are overstimulated.  Willie!  Remove all the colored
         chalk from the classrooms.
 Willie: I warned ya!  Didn't I warn ya?!  That colored chalk was forged
         by Lucifer himself!
-- 

Cut to Lisa and Bart on the couch at home.  They are watching the Itchy
&amp; Scratchy cartoon "Esophagus Now".  Bart laughs uproariously.

Lisa: I never realized before, but some Itchy &amp; Scratchy cartoons send
      the message that violence against animals is funny.
Bart: They what?  Cartoons don't have messages, Lisa.  [Moves toward
      door.]  They're just a bunch of hilarious stuff you know, like
      people getting hurt and stuff, stuff like that.
       [gets slammed behind the door by Homer]
-- Why I oughta --, 

Homer: Look kids!  I just got my party invitiations back from the
       printers.
 Lisa: [Reading the invitation.]  "Come to Homer's BBBQ.  The extra B is
       for BYOBB."
 Bart: What's that extra B for?
Homer: It's a typo.
 Lisa: Dad!  Can't you have some other type of party, one where you
       don't serve meat?
Homer: All normal people love meat.  If I went to a barbeque and there
       was no meat, I would say 'Yo Goober!  Where's the meat!?'.  I'm
       trying to impress people here Lisa.  You don't win friends with
       salad.
-- Homer coins a catch phrase., 

Bart dances in.

 Bart: [Musically.]  You don't win friends with salad!
       You don't win friends with salad!
       You don't win friends with salad!
        [Homer, {and then Marge, join in.}]
 Lisa: {Mom!}
Marge: {I don't mean to take sides, I just got caught up in the rhythm.}
-- The island rhythm, 

Scene moves to Springfield Elementary, where Principal Skinner is
standing before a projection screen in front of Miss Hoover's classroom.

Skinner: Good morning class.  A certain...agitator...for privacy's sake
         let's call her...Lisa S. No, that's too obvious...uuuh, let's
         say L. Simpson --
          [Lisa slaps her forehead in a slient D'oh!]
         has raised questions about certain school policies.  So, in the
         interest in creating an open dialogue, sit silently and watch
         this film.
-- Instructions in obfuscation, 

The film starts.  "The Meat Council Presents: `Meat and You: Partners in
Freedom'.  Number 3F03 in the `Resistance is Useless' series."  Open on
cattle country.

 Troy: Nothing beats a stroll in cattle country.  Hi, I'm Troy McClure.
       You may remember me from such educational films as "Two Minus
       Three Equals Negative Fun" and "Firecrackers: The Silent Killer".
Jimmy: Mr. McClure?
 Troy: Oh!  Hello Bobby.
Jimmy: Jimmy.  I'm curious as to how meat gets from the ranch to my
       stomach.
 Troy: Whoa, whoa, whoa!  Slow down Jimmy.  You just asked a mouthful.
       It all starts here, in the high density feed lot.  Then, when the
       cattle are just right [swipes his finger along the top of a cow
       and licks it] Yum...it's time for them to graduate from Bovine
       University.
-- Summa cum laude, 

A klaxon blares out a siren and the cattle begin moving up a conveyor
belt into the meat packing plant.

 Troy: Come on Jimmy, let's take a peek at the killing floor.
Jimmy: Ohhh!
 Troy: Don't let the name throw you Jimmy.  It's not really a floor,
       it's more of a steel grating that allows material to sluice
       through so it can be collected and exported.
-- Troy nearly got in at Hendon, 

They walk throught the door of the plant accompanied by the sounds of
moo-ing and startled cows.  Electricity noise sparks in the background
as the camera pans down the length of the factory to a truck marked
"Meat For You" being loaded with raw chunks of meat.  Troy and Jimmy
emerge, with Jimmy visibly pale and queasy.

       Troy: Gettin hungry Jimmy?
      Jimmy: Uhh, Mr. McClure?  I have a crazy friend who says its wrong
             to eat meat.  Is he crazy?
       Troy: Nooo, just ignorant.  You see your crazy friend never heard
             of "The Food Chain".  [Flash to a picture of "Food Chain",
             with all animals and arrows pointing to a silhouette of a
             human.]  Just ask this scientician.
Scientician: [Looking up from a microscope.]  Uhhh...
       Troy: He'll tell you that, in nature, one creature invariably
             eats another creature to survive.
              [Images of various wild carnivores attacking and eating
             others appear.]
             Don't kid yourself Jimmy.  If a cow ever got the chance,
             he'd eat you and everyone you care about!  [Image of a cow
             quietly chewing cud.]
      Jimmy: Wow, Mr. McClure.  I was a grade A moron to ever question
             eating meat.
       Troy: [Laughs.]  Yes you were Jimmy, yes you were.  [Briskly rubs
             his hand on Jimmy's head.]
      Jimmy: [Timid] Uhh...you're hurting me.
-- Troy McClure, the silent hurter, 

Film's over.

   Lisa: They can't seriously expect us to swallow that tripe.
Skinner: Now as a special treat courtesy of our friends at the Meat
         Council, please help yourself to this tripe.  [Class cheers and
         runs to table loaded with tripe.]
   Lisa: Stop it Stop IT!  Don't you realize you've just been
         brainwashed by corporate propaganda?
  Janie: Hmmph, apparently my crazy friend here hasn't heard of the food
         chain.
   Uter: Yeah, Lisa's a grade A moron!
  Ralph: When I grow up, I'm going to go to Bovine University.
-- In Idaho, 

Scene changes to home and Homer's barbeque.  Many cars have pulled up.
Homer is at the door greeting arriving guests when Barney comes through
wheeling a beer keg on a handcart.

Barney: Hi Homer!  Thanks for inviting me to your barbeque.
 Homer: Ohh, Barney!  You brought a whole beer keg!
Barney: Yeah.  Where can I fill it up?
-- Toddle down to Moe's, perhaps?, 

People sitting everywhere, eating.  Homer fills the grill with lighter
fluid and prepares to grill.

  Lisa: Wait Dad!  Good news, everyone!  You don't have to eat meat!
        I've got enough gazpacho for everyone.  [Crowd murmurs.]  It's
        tomato soup, served ice cold!  [Crowd laughs out loud.]
Barney: Go back to Russia!
-- At least Lisa's mother's not from Norway, 

Lisa troops up to her room to sob on her bed.  The crowd continues to
appreciate the barbeque.

Hibbert: Aaah.  Diagnosis -- delicious.
  Homer: I've got the presciption for you, another hot beef injection!
 Wiggum: Uuuh, Homer?  Bring me another one of those...uuh. burgers
         would ya?  I can't quite seem to...stand up under my own power
         anymore.
  Homer: One whopper for the Copper.
   Bart: Another burger, Dad?
  Homer: Here you go!  [Flips the burger into the air.]
   Lisa: It's bad enough they're all eating meat.  They don't have to
         rub it in my face.
          [The flipped burger lands on her face.]
          [Lisa growls]
-- Ah, glorious fat, 

Homer wheels out the large grill.

       Homer: Okay everybody!  It's the moment you've all been waiting
              for!  The piggs de resistance!  [Uncovers a rotissory pig
              with an apple in its mouth.]
       Crowd: Ooohhh!  Aaaahhh.
Chief Wiggum: [Chuckling] ha hah haah hah...look at its nose!
         Ned: [Rises with a glass in hand.]  Congratulations, Homer.
              Your 'Q is a huge success.  Hey, a toast to the host who
              can boast the most roast!
       Homer: Thanks Flanders.  I have to agree that everything
              certainly ...[Lisa rolls behind homer with a lawn tractor,
              pushing the pig grill ahead of her.] huh?  [Crowd gasps.]
       Marge: Bart, Nooooo!
        Bart: [Standing beside her.]  What?!
       Marge: Sorry, force of habit.  Lisa, nooooo!
-- Mouth before brain, take two, 

Bart and Homer race wildly after Lisa until she pushes the pig grill off
the top of a slope.  The pig passes through a hedge.

Homer: It's just a little dirty.  It's still good, it's still good!
        [Passes traffic, jumps a bridge and lands in the water.]
       It's just a little slimy, it's still good, it's still good!
        [It gets caught in a dam spillway, and when the pressure builds,
       it shoots into the sky.]
       It's just a little airborne, it's still good, it's still good!
 Bart: [Crestfallen.]  It's gone.
Homer: I know.
-- Courting disaster, 

Monty Burns and Smithers stand at the window of Burns' office.

   Burns: You know, Smithers, I think I'll donate a million dollars to
          the local orphanage...when pigs fly!
           [They laugh.  The pig sails across the sky before them.]
Smithers: Will you be donating that million dollars now, Sir?
   Burns: Nooo, I'd still prefer not.
-- Going back on his word, 

[End of Act Two.  Time: 15:03]

Homer and Bart are standing in their backyard.  Homer is scanning the
sky with binoculars.

 Bart: Give it up Dad.  Piggy ain't coming back.
Homer: Lisa!  You ruined my barbeque!  I demand you apologize this
       second!
 Lisa: I'm never ever apologizing because I was standing up for a just
       cause and you were wrong wrong wrong!  Now if you'll excuse me
       I'm going to my room!
Homer: That's it!  Go to your room!
-- Mouth before brain, take three, 

The family is gathered around the breakfast table.

Homer: Marge?  Since I'm not talking to Lisa, would you please ask her
       to pass me the syrup?
Marge: [Wearily] Dear, please pass your father the syrup, Lisa.
 Lisa: Bart, tell Dad I will only pass the syrup if it won't be used on
       any meat product.
 Bart: [To Homer] You dunkin' your sausages in that syrup homeboy?
Homer: Marge, tell Bart I just want to drink a nice glass of syrup like
       I do every morning.
Marge: Tell him yourself, you're ignoring Lisa, not Bart.
Homer: Bart, thank your mother for pointing that out.
Marge: Homer, you're not, not talking to me, and secondly, I heard what
       you said.
Homer: Lisa, tell your mother to get off my case!
 Bart: Uhhh, Dad.  Lisa's the one you're not talking to.
Homer: Bart!  Go to your room.
 Lisa: Why don't you just eat him, Dad!
Homer: I don't need any serving suggestions from you, you barbeque
       wrecking, no-nothing know-it-all!
 Lisa: That's IT!  I can't live in a house with this prehistoric
       carnivore.  I'm out of here!  [Leaves and slams the door.]
Homer: That's it!  Go to your room!
-- Mouth before -- oh, forget it, 

Lisa walks across the street where Sherri and Terri, Janie and Ralph are
playing.

 Sheri/Terri: Look at Missus Potato Head!  She has a head made out of
              lettuce.  [Giggles.]
       Ralph: I can't believe I used to go out with you.
       Janie: Are you going to marry a carrot, Lisa?
        Lisa: [Rolling her eyes.]  Yes, I'm going to marry a carrot.
Sherri/Terri: Ohh!  She admitted it.  She's going to marry a carrot!
-- So much for sarcasm, 

Lisa walks near the Krusty Burger franchise.  The sign in the window
says "TRY OUR NEW BEEF-FLAVORED CHICKEN".  She looks up to see a
billboard displaying a "Don't Eat Beef" sign, which is replaced a moment
later with "Eat Deer."  She throws her hands in the air and runs to the
Kwik-E Mart.  The sign in that window says "Premiere Gourmet Hot Dogs
8/99 cents."

Lisa: The whole world wants me to eat meat.  I can't fight it anymore.
       [She musters her resolve and bites into a hot dog.  Yells.]
      There!  Is everybody happy now?
 Apu: I take it from your yelling that you like my tofu dogs?
Lisa: Tofu?
 Apu: Oh yes.  No meat whatsoever.  And only thrice the fat of a normal
      hot dog.  I made the switch and nobody noticed.
Lisa: But why, Apu?
 Apu: Of course I am a vegetarian.  Haven't you ever seen my tee-shirt?
      [Holds up a tee-shirt that depicts a cow with slash over it and
      the words "Don't Have A Cow, Man!"]
Lisa: Heh heh heh, that's cute.
 Apu: Here.  Let me show you something Lisa.  [Walks to a cooler marked
      'Non-Alcoholic Beer" and opens the door.  A set of stairs leading
      upward is behind it.]
Lisa: Wow, a secret staircase.  But what do you do if someone wants a
      non-alcoholic beer?
 Apu: You know, it's never come up.
-- Beer-swilling Springfield tube-jockeys, 

They walk to the top of the stairs, to a door.  Apu opens the door,
revealing a lush rooftop oasis.

Lisa: Ohhh, Apu!  It's beautiful!
 Apu: Yes.  This is where I come when I need some refuge from the modern
      world.  Or, when I want to see drive-in movies for free.  [Points
      out the drive-in theatre across the street.]  I know it is not
      easy to be a vegetarian, Lisa.
Lisa: That's why I ran away from home.
-- The naked truth, 

Paul McCartney steps from the brush.

 Paul: What?  She's leaving home?
 Lisa: Wow!  Paul McCartney!  I read about you in history class.  So
       where's your wife Linda?
Linda: Right here Lisa.  [Appears out of a bush.]  Whenever we're in
       Springfield we like to hang out in Apu's garden in the shade.
 Paul: We met him in India years ago, during the Maharishi days.
  Apu: Back then I was known as the fifth Beatle.
 Paul: [Rolling his eyes.]  Sure you were, Apu.
  Apu: You know what Lisa?  Paul and Linda are vegetarians too.  In
       fact, Linda has her own line of vegetarian entrees.
 Lisa: Apu, I'm sure the last thing they want to talk about is...
Linda: We weren't satisfied with the other vegetarian meals on the
       market.  You'd be surprised how often you find a big hunk of pork
       in them.
 Lisa: Euuuwww!
-- And if you're a _Jewish_ vegetarian..., 

Paul: Linda and I both feel strongly about animal rights.  In fact, if
      you play "Maybe I'm Amazed" backwards, you'll hear a recipe for a
      really ripping lentil soup.
Lisa: When will all those fools learn that you can be perfectly healthy
      simply eating vegetables, fruits, grains and cheese.
 Apu: Oh, cheese!
Lisa: You don't eat cheese, Apu?
 Apu: No I don't eat any food that comes from an animal.
Lisa: Ohh, then you must think I'm a monster!
 Apu: Yes indeed I do think that.  But, I learned long ago Lisa to
      tolerate others rather than forcing my beliefs on them.  You know
      you can influence people without badgering them always.  It's like
      Paul's song, "Live and Let Live".
Paul: Actually, it was "Live and Let Die".
 Apu: Well, whatever, whatever. it had a good rhythm.
-- 

Lisa: I guess I have been pretty hard on a lot of people.  Especially my
      dad.  Thank you guys.
Paul: Lisa, before you go.  Would you like to hear a song?
Lisa: Wow, that would be great!
Paul: OK, take it Apu.
-- That's Apu de Beaumarchais to you, 

Apu starts singly badly, while Paul and Linda clap along.  Lisa backs
away quietly and leaves the store, where she sees Homer looking under
manhole covers for her.

Homer: Lisa!  Lisa!  Come back before everyone finds out what a horrible
       father I am.
 Lisa: Hi dad.  Looking for me?
Homer: I don't know.  You looking for me?
 Lisa: I don't know.
Homer: Ohhhh.  Lisa.  I was looking for you.  I wanted to apologize.  I
       don't know exactly what went wrong but it's always my fault.
 Lisa: Actually Dad, this time, I was wrong...
Homer: Oooh!
 Lisa: ...too.
Homer: Ohh.
 Lisa: While I was gone I got some really good advice from Paul and
       Linda McCartney.
Homer: Rock stars.  Is there anything they don't know?
-- The eternal question, 

 Lisa: I still stand by my beliefs.  But I can't defend what I did.  I'm
       sorry I messed up your barbeque.
Homer: I understand honey.  I used to believe in things when I was a
       kid.  Come on, I'll give you a piggyback...I mean a veggieback
       ride home.
-- The new 90s vocab, 

They giggle.

[End of Act Three.  Time: 21:11]

"Maybe I'm Amazed" plays into the closing credits.  Ricardo Lafaurie
transcribes the lyrics as follows, with ellipses indicating where Paul
speaks backwards:

Maybe I'm amazed at the way you love me all the time
Maybe I'm amazed at the way I love you
You pulled me out of time
You hung me on the line
Maybe I'm amazed at the way I really need you
...
Maybe I'm a man, maybe I'm a lonely man
Who's in the middle of something
...
That he doesn't really understand
...
Maybe I'm a man, and baby, you're the only woman
Who could ever help me
...
Baby, won't you help me to understand?
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

The instrumental continues while McCartney continues speaking backwards.

 EPISODE TITLE: Treehouse of Horror VI


EPISODE SUMMARY: 
First segment title: "Attack of the 50-Foot Eyesores"

Homer drives down a road.

Homer: Ah, the miracle mile, where value wears a neon sombrero and
       there's not a single church or library to offend the eye.
        [spots "Lard Lad Donuts" and its tubby boy statue holding a
       donut over his head]
       There it is!  The chain that put the "fat" in "fat Southern
       sheriffs".
        [walks in to the store]
       I want a colossal donut, just like the one on the sign.
        [gets handed a regular-sized donut]
       D'oh!  Nuts.  That's false advertising!
  Kid: Sorry, sir, no refunds.
Homer: [menacing] I paid for a colossal donut, and I'm going to get a
       colossal donut!  [walks out]
  Kid: You don't scare us!
-- Homer threatens pastry revenge, 

Homer drives back home to get some equipment, then returns to the Lard
Lad Donuts boy.  He listens to the radio on the way as the weather turns
thunderous.

Announcer: Astronomers from Tacoma to Vladivostok have just reported an
           ionic disturbance in the vicinity of the Van Allen Belt.
           Scientists are recommending that necessary precautions be
           taken.
    Homer: [scoffs] Eggheads.  What do they know?
-- Homer denounces the familiae scientia, 

Donning pantyhose to conceal his identity, he swings a chain with a hook
around several times and releases it.  It attaches itself around the
donut on the first shot.  He hooks the other end to his car and stomps
the gas, eventually dislodging the giant metal donut.  He drives away
giggling, "I got your donut, Lard Lad!  And what are _you_ going to do
about it?"

Just then, the ionic disturbance creates a bolt of specially-charged
lightning that strikes the Lard Lad, bringing him to life.  His head
swivels around to watch Homer's receding car and his brow furrows.  He
tears his feet loose from the bolts in the ground holding them and howls
just like Godzilla.  All the other giant statues along the miracle mile
come to life too and look in the direction of Homer's car.

Homer puts the giant metal donut in his living room and drinks a beer on
top of it in his underwear.

Marge: [walking in] Homer!  Where did you get that?
Homer: [pause] Get what?
Marge: That giant donut.
Homer: Well, I acquired it legally.  You can be sure of that.
-- Found out, 

The giant neon cowboy on the Duff Beer billboard comes to life and tips
his hat to a nearby group of people cheering him on.  "Dude, you're
huge!" says one as the cowboy steps out of the sign.  "Yeah, let's
party, baby," says another.  The cowboy uses his neon beer bottle to
squish the crowd.

The three Zip Boys (huge heads on tiny bodies) come to life and hop off
the top of the store roof, grinning and growling amongst themselves.
The crazy old man comes out and hollers, "Fellas!  Where are you going
at this hour?"  Their heads, being so huge, fall to the ground under
their own weight and they drag them away.  "Hey!  Don't scratch up them
heads!" calls the old man.

Kent Brockman delivers a news report about it from atop a building as
the mascots wreck things in the background.

Kent: Good morning, everybody.  Panic is gripping Springfield as giant
      advertising mascots rampage through the city.  Perhaps it's part
      of some daring new ad campaign, but what new product could justify
      such carnage?
       [behind him, a poster of himself comes to life]
      A cleanser?  A fat-free fudge cake that doesn't let you down in
      the flavor department like so many others?  Would --
       [he gets grabbed by his giant doppelganger]
      D-ooh!  Let me go -- no!  Stop!  No!
       ["Technical difficulties" sign appears]
-- Newscaster Brockman has been eaten, 

The Red Devil Realty mascot (a devil) picks up the schoolbus full of
children.  "Man, another acid flashback," says Otto.  "I'd hate to be
driving a bus right now!"  Elsewhere, Mr. Peanut, the Planters mascot,
picks up a car full of people, opens it like a peanut, and pops the
people into his mouth.

Chief Wiggum spies a large man walking out of a store.  He pulls his gun
and shoots him dead.  He and Lou go over to inspect the body.

Wiggum: Aw, they're not so tough.
   Lou: Um...Chief, that wasn't a monster.  That was the captain of the
        high school basketball team.
Wiggum: Uh, yeah, well, he was turning into a monster.  Yeah.
-- Shoot first, make justifications later, 

The Red Devil approaches Springfield Elementary, towering over it.  On
his shoulder, Bart says into his right ear, "What are you waiting for?
Wreck the school.  You know you wanna."  The devil appears pensive; into
his left ear, Bart says in a different voice, "I agree: destroy the
school."  This seems to be the impetus the devil needs: he crushes the
school with his hoof.

At the Simpson house, the doorbell rings.

Homer: [answering door] Hello?  Yes?  Oh.
        [sees that it's Lard Lad]
       Heh heh.  If you're looking for that big donut of yours, um...
       Flanders has it.  Just smash open his house.
        [shut door; the sound of giant footsteps recedes]
       He came to life.  Good for him!
        [Smash!  Crumble!  Tinkle!]
        [giant footsteps approach; the doorbell rings]
        [Homer opens the door]
  Ned: [running away] Help me, Lord!
Homer: I told you!  Flanders has it.  Or Moe.  Go kill Moe!
Marge: [arriving home in the car] Homer, just give him the donut!  Once
       he has it, that will be the end of all this horror.
Homer: Well...OK.  If it'll end horror.
-- Cogent arguments, 

With his donut back, Lard Lad stands triumphantly in his usual pose --
but only for a couple of seconds.  He uses the donut to smash the
Simpsons roof and a nearby car, kicks a barking dog like a football, and
rakes his donut along the roof of every house down the block.  "Don't
you ever get tired of being wrong all the time?"  Homer asks Marge.
"Sometimes..."

Downtown Springfield is a scene of terrible carnage as the monsters
wreak havoc.  "These monsters are destroying everything and everyone we
hold dear!" laments Marge.  "And you kids should have jackets on."  Lisa
notices a copyright stamp in Lard Lad's footprint, with the name of the
company that built him, and she rides her bike there.

Lisa: If your advertising agency created all those giant characters, you
      must know how to stop them.
 Man: Well sir, advertising is a funny thing.  If people stop paying
      attention to it, pretty soon, it goes away.
Lisa: Like that old woman who couldn't find the beef?
 Man: Exactly.  If you stop paying attention to the monsters, they'll
      lose their powers.
Lisa: But people can't help looking at them.  They're wrecking the town.
       [out the window, the monsters wreck the town]
 Man: You know, maybe a jingle would help.
       [plays a piano arpeggio, sings] Don't watch the mon --
       [plays another arpeggio] Don't watch the...monsters-s-s.
       [chuckles] Well, it'll sound a lot better coming out of Paul
      Anka.
-- The medium is the message, 

Outside, a crowd of people watch the monsters.  Lard Lad bashes Jebediah
Springfield with his donut.  Lisa addresses them with a megaphone.

    Lisa: Hey, Springfield!  Are you suffering from the heartbreak
          of...Monster-itis?  Then take a tip from Mr. Paul Anka!
           [Paul waves, begins playing a small synthesizer and singing]
          To stop those monsters, one-two-three,
          Here's a fresh new way that's trouble-free.
          It's got Paul Anka's guarantee...[winks]
    Lisa: [singing] Guarantee void in Tennessee.
Together: [singing] Just don't look.  Just don't look.
           [people turn away; the monsters turn to look]
          Just don't look.  Just don't look.
           [more people turn away]
          Just don't look.  Just don't look.
           [the monsters try to destroy things faster, but start
          collapsing]
-- The power of music, 

Paul Bunyon falls on the Springfield General Hospital, his ox Babe
destroys the birthplace of Jebediah Springfield, and a flying magic
carpet destroys the birthplace of Norman Vincent Peale.

 Lisa: [jubilant] It worked!  They're all dead.
 Bart: Well, except for chubsy-ubsy over there.
        [everyone turns and gasps]
        [Lard Lad tempts Homer with the giant donut]
Homer: Mmm...sprinkles.
Marge: Homer!  Stop looking.
 Lisa: Don't make us poke your eyes out, Dad.
        [they drag him away]
Homer: [groaning] Oh!
        [Lard Lad collapses]
-- The demise of the pudgy one, 

As Lard Lad falls, his donut rolls away.  Kodos and Kang, meanwhile, are
trying to hitch a ride in the middle of the desert with a sign saying
"Earth Capital".

Kodos: Here comes something!
 Kang: Remember the story: we're newlyweds on our way to Earth Capital.
        [the donut rolls by as Kang smiles]
       Oh, Shazbot.
-- Kang calling Orson?, 

 Kent: Even as I speak, the scourge of advertising could be heading
       toward _your_ town!  Lock your doors, bar your windows, because
       the next advertisement you see could destroy your house and eat
       your family!
Homer: [smarmy] We'll be right back.
-- Cut to commercial, 

[End of Act One.  Time: 6:26]

Segment two title: "Nightmare on Evergreen Terrace"

Bart plays frisbee with SLH as a goofy rendition of "Pop Goes the
Weasel" plays in the background.

 Bart: OK, boy: catch the frisbee.
        [SLH does so]
       Good catch, boy!
  SLH: [taking the frisbee from his mouth] Thanks, Bart.
        [throws it at him; it hits Bart in the face]
        [Bart does a flip; "NO SALE" appears in his eyes and birds fly
       around his head]
  SLH: Oh, hard luck.
        [Bart shakes his head to clear it, then spots Willy dressed as
       Freddy Krueger, holding a rake]
 Bart: Aah!  [his eyes bulge out]
        [Willy brandishes the rake; Bart holds up a "Help me!" sign]
Willy: Glad to rake your acquaintance.  [laughs evilly]
        [he swipes at Bart, who wakes up yelling]
 Bart: [sighs] Ohh...it was only a dream.
        [sees the scrapes on his stomach] Aah!
Homer: [elsewhere, sounding worried] Bart!  Is that you?
 Bart: Yes!
Homer: Take out the garbage.
-- All work and no play, 

Bart relates the creepy tale to his chums in the schoolyard.

   Bart: And then he raked me across the chest!  And the weirdest thing
         was, it was that school janitor who mysteriously disappeared:
         Groundskeeper Willy!
   Lisa: [gasps] Oh my God!  Bart, Groundskeeper Willy was in my
         nightmare too!  [holds open hand] But he got me with hedge
         clippers.
          [her hair is missing two spikes]
 Nelson: [gleaming] He ran his floor buffer over me.
Skinner: [walking up, chuckling] Children, I couldn't help monitoring
         your conversation.  There's no mystery about Willy.  Why, he --
         simply disappeared.  Now, let's have no more curiosity about
         this bizarre cover-up.
-- Exit Skinner, 

Mrs. Krabappel hands out a test to Bart's class.

  Edna: Remember, class: the worse you do on this standardized test, the
        more funding the school gets.  So don't knock yourselves out.
        You have three hours to --
Martin: [joyous] Finished!
  Edna: [grunts] Then put your head down on your desk and sit quietly.
Martin: Ah, a duet of pleasures.  [does so]
-- Martin, musical, 

In his dream, Martin is dressed as a wizard.

Martin: I am the wondrous wizard of Latin!  I am a dervish of declension
        and a conjurer of conjugation, with a million hit points and
        maximum charisma.
         [spots a blackboard with verbs written all over it]
        Aha!  "Morire": to die.  "Morit": he, she, or it dies.
         [Willy morphs out of the blackboard; Martin gasps]
 Willy: "Moris": _you_ die.
Martin: Aah!  [runs off]
 Willy: [laughs] You've mastered a dead tongue, but can you handle a
        live one?
         [his tongue shoots out of his mouth, wraps around Martin, and
        squeezes him]
         [in class, Martin twists and screams, then collapses on the
        floor]
Nelson: Ha ha!
-- 

Martin's body is laid on a trolley with a sheet over it.

 Skinner: Wheel him out quietly.  It's best the children don't see.
           [Lunch Lady Doris starts wheeling out the trolley]
           [the sheet, stuck under Skinner's foot, comes off]
Children: [seeing Martin's twisted features] Aah!
 Skinner: Oh, just get it out of here.
          Not into the kindergarten!  [more screams from outside]
-- Traumatizing the wee ones, 

When Bart and Lisa arrive home, they burst in with the news.

 Lisa: Mom!  Dad!  Martin died at school today!
Marge: Mmm!  I don't see what that has to do with Groundskeeper Willy.
 Bart: [pause] Umm...we didn't mention Groundskeeper Willy, Mom.
Marge: Mmm...kids, it's time we told you the true story and put your
       fears to rest.  It's a story of murder and revenge from beyond
       the grave.
-- Oh yeah, _real_ assuaging, 

The scene changes to parents walking into Springfield Elementary while
it snows.

Marge: [voice over] It all started on the thirteenth hour, of the
       thirteenth day, of the thirteenth month.  We were there to
       discuss the misprinted calendars the school had purchased.
Homer: [shivering, looking at the calendar] Oh, lousy Smarch weather.
        [spies the thermostat with a note from Willy over it]
        [reads] "Do not touch Willy."  Good advice!  [cranks it]
-- Punctuation and you, for Homer Simpson, 

The flames in the furnace flare up.  Willy stops playing his bagpipes to
check it out, but the furnace explodes, engulfing him in flames.

Skinner: Our next budget item: $12 for doorknob repair.
Parents: Nay!
          [burning Willy tries to escape, but the doorknob falls off]
Skinner: Recharge fire extinguishers?  Now, this is a, uh, _free_
         service of the fire department --
Parents: Nay!
  Homer: Nay.
          [burning Willy tries to use the fire extinguisher, but it's
         empty]
          [he breaks out of the furnace room and runs into the
         classroom]
  Willy: Help!  Please help me!
Skinner: [reproachful] Willy, please!  Mr. Van Houten has the floor.
 Mr. VH: Er, I, for one, would like to see the cafeteria menus in
         advance so parents can adjust their dinner menus accordingly.
         I don't like the idea of Milhouse having two spaghetti meals in
         one day.
          [Willy explodes into flame and screams for a few seconds]
          [the parents turn to watch]
  Willy: [a mere skeleton] You'll pay for this...with your children's
         blood!
 Wiggum: Oh, right.  How are you going to get them?  Skeleton power?
  Willy: I'll strike where you canna protect them -- in their dreams!
-- The smouldering skeleton speaks, 

His skeleton collapses into ashes, which are magically swept up into a
dustpan and deposited in the garbage.

Lisa: Bart!  Don't you realize what this means?  The next time we fall
      asleep, we could [weakly] die!
 Abe: Ehh, welcome to my world!  [falls asleep]
-- Touche, 

Bart and Lisa try hard to stay awake that night.  Lisa gives Maggie a
Buzz Cola to drink while the three children watch "Asian Market Wrapup."

Announcer: There's a volcano waiting to erupt in the Pacific Rim.  Its
           name: medium-term convertible debentures.
     Lisa: It's no use, Bart: we can't stay up forever.
     Bart: You're right.  The only thing left to do is go into my dream
           and force Willy into a final showdown.  You stay awake, and
           if it looks like I'm in trouble, wake me up.
     Lisa: OK.  But promise you won't be grouchy.
-- Conditional support, 

Bart yawns and closes his eyes.  He opens them again and looks behind
him to see the school, looking dark and sinister.  He walks gingerly
through the playground, looking around himself.  "Come on, Willy: I know
you're out there."  Willy, his giant head atop a fierce lawn-mowing
machine, plows through the hedge behind Bart.  Bart cries out and runs
off while Willy laughs.

Seeing the sandbox gives Bart an idea.  While Willy looks around for
him, Bart takes some clippings of grass lying in garbage bags nearby and
sprinkles them over the sandbox, waters them with a hose, then stands
with the sandbox in front of him and calls out to Willy.

 Bart: Hey, Lawn Boy!  You missed a spot!  [motions to sandbox]
Willy: When I'm done with you, they'll have to do a compost-mortem!
-- Witty retorts, 

Willy shifts himself into high gear and tromps the gas, flying toward
Bart and growling.  When he hits the sandbox, though, his wheels turn
uselessly.  "Sinky sand!" he cries, morphing into several different
(tartan) shapes before turning into himself and sinking into the sand.

  Bart: [sighs with relief] Willy's gone for good.  Now I can get back
        to my normal dreams: me and Krusty winning the Super Bowl!
         [Krusty, dressed in a football uniform, runs up as a crowd
        cheers]
Krusty: Bart, there's two seconds left.  Now listen up.  It's your basic
        Statue of Liberty play with one twist: you throw it to me!
        Knute Rockne called it the forward pass.
         [behind Bart, a giant tartan spiderlike bagpipe with Willy's
        head on it rises from the sandbox]
        Now, the clock's still running, so it's important we start this
        play as quickly as possible.
  Bart: [getting grabbed] Aah!
Krusty: Oh, boy.  Don't dream about me no more, kid.  [runs off]
-- Some supportive clown _he_ is, 

Bart: Help, Lisa!  Help!
Lisa: [running toward the sandbox] Bart, you're in trouble!  Wake up!
Bart: Wait a minute...if you're here, then you've fallen asleep too!
Lisa: I'm not asleep, I'm justing resting my ey -- uh oh.  Aah!
       [gets grabbed by Willy, who continues sinking into the sand]
      Goodbye, Bart.
Bart: Goodbye, Lis.  Hope you get reincarnated as someone who can stay
      awake for fifteen minutes!
-- Bart, closet Buddhist, 

All seems lost until Maggie appears and blocks Willy's exit hole with
her pacifier.  Willy tries vainly to pull it out, but he expands
gradually until he explodes, raining scraps of tartan all over the
place.  The three children fly up to the moon, circle it, then land on
their couch and awaken.  "You saved us, Maggie!" says Lisa, hugging her.
Maggie pulls out another pacifier, twiddles it around, and puts it in
her mouth.

The three of them walk out the front door the next morning.

 Lisa: I don't know, Bart.  Something tells me Willy's still out there,
       and that he could come back at any time in any form and kill us
       in ways we can't even imagine!
        [a bus pulls up; Willy gets off]
Willy: Boo!  [laughs] [makes some faces and noises]
        [the bus leaves]
       Stop!  I left my gun on the seat.  Hey!
        [he starts chasing it, then turns back] Wait here, please.
        [he runs off, losing his shoe, while a saxophone plays the theme
       song]
-- Rowdy Roddy Peeper, goofball, 

[End of Act Two.  Time: 14:03]

Third segment title: "Homer^3"

Outside, thunder crashes as Marge calls out to Homer.

Marge: Homer!  Get ready!  Patty and Selma will be here any minute.
Homer: D'oh!  Oh no...better ride this one out in the closet.
        [opens it to see Bart and Lisa standing there]
 Lisa: Sorry, Dad.  This is our spot.
Homer: Oh yeah?  Well it's _my_ house, so it's _my_ spot.
 Bart: N'uh uh, because we called it.
Homer: Did not!
 Lisa: Well, we're calling it now.
Homer: [plaintive] You are?
 Bart: 'Fraid so.
Homer: Ohh, they got me with their legal mumbo-jumbo.
-- Which they learned from Matlock, 

Homer checks under the carpet in front of the TV, but the pets have
already claimed that spot for themselves.  The doorbell rings.

Marge: [hearing the doorbell] Just a second!
Homer: D'oh!  [whimpers] Huh?  [spots a bookcase]
       I never looked behind this whatchamacallit case before.
        [chuckles; leans on wall, but his hand goes through it]
       Huh?  [swirls his hand around] It's like something out of that
       twilighty show about that zone.
        [Marge opens the door]
Patty: How's it hanging, Marge?
Selma: Ugh!  I'm baking like a meatloaf under this wet wool.
        [opens coat closet, catches Bart and Lisa hiding there]
 Bart: Uh...[nervous smile] may I take your coat, Aunt Selma?
 Lisa: Um...I would also like to take your coat.
Selma: Have we got a family activity for you:
Patty: A pillowcase full of seashells from our trip to Sulfur Bay.
Selma: You can help us clean and organize them.
Patty: And pry out all the dead hermit crabs.  Get a screwdriver.
-- Fun?  Wow, 

Homer will have none of it.

Homer: I'll take my chances in the mystery wall!
        [goes into it]
        [steps out into 3D land, looks around]
        [thinking] Oh, glory of glories.  Oh heavenly testament to the
       eternal majesty of God's creation.
        [out loud] Holy macaroni!
Patty: [sucking on a hermit crab] Hey!  You can just _suck_ 'em out!
Homer: [disembodied] Hello?  Can anybody hear me?
Marge: Homer!  Where are you?
Homer: Uh, I'm somewhere where I don't know where I am.
Marge: Do you see towels?  If you see towels, you're probably in the
       linen closet again.
Homer: Just a second...no, it's a place I've never been before.
Selma: Hmm.  The shower.  [laughs]
-- Strike one, 

"Hey!"  Homer calls out indignantly.  He looks around and scratches
himself.

Homer: I don't want to alarm you, Marge, but I seem to be trapped in
       here.
Marge: Hmm.  I better call Ned.  He has a ladder!
        [in 3D land]
Homer: What's going on here?  I'm so bulgy.
        [taps his belly; it ripples for a while]
       My stomach sticks way out in front and my -- aah!
        [checks out his bulgy behind]
        [in the living room]
  Ned: [on top of his ladder] Well, as the tree said to the lumberjack,
       I'm stumped.
Selma: Hmm.  It's like he just disappeared into fat air.  [laughs]
Homer: Hey!  Shut up.
-- Strike two, 

In the background, a cone bounces off the green grid Homer is standing
on.  He walks past a building, strangely reminiscent of a building in a
certain video game, and up to a swimming pool with fish in it.  "Mmm...
unprocessed fish sticks," he slobbers.  His drool hits the pool and
frightens the fish away.

He walks up to a sign with arrows pointing along the three axes, X, Y,
and Z.

Homer: Man, this place looks expensive.  I feel like I'm wasting a
       fortune just standing here.
        [scratches and looks around]
       Well, better make the most of it.
        [burps]
-- Homer in 3D land, 

The bouncing cone lodges itself in his butt.  "Ow!  Watch it, coney!"
He pulls it out and tosses it away.  It lodges itself in the ground,
point down, and creates a depression that begins deepening at an
alarming rate.  "Oops," he says meekly.

Marge has called Rev. Lovejoy and Dr. Hibbert in to help.

Lovejoy: Do you see a light, Homer?
  Homer: [disembodied] Yes...
Lovejoy: Move into the light, my son.
  Homer: [a buzzing is heard] Aah!
Hibbert: Homer, this is your physician, Dr. Julius Hibbert.  Can you
         tell us what it's like in there?
  Homer: Uh...it's like...did anyone see the movie "Tron"?
Hibbert: No.
   Lisa: No.
  Marge: No.
 Wiggum: No.
   Bart: No.
  Patty: No.
 Wiggum: No.
    Ned: No.
  Selma: No.
  Frink: No.
Lovejoy: No.
 Wiggum: Yes.  I mean -- um, I mean, no.  No, heh.
-- 

Frink draws a strange diagram on the wall.

    Lisa: Well, where's my Dad?
   Frink: Well, it should be obvious to even the most dim-witted
          individual who holds an advanced degree in hyperbolic
          topology, n'gee, that Homer Simpson has stumbled into...[the
          lights go off] the third dimension.
    Lisa: [turning the lights back on] Sorry.
   Frink: [drawing on a blackboard] Here is an ordinary square --
  Wiggum: Whoa, whoa -- slow down, egghead!
   Frink: -- but suppose we exte-end the square beyond the two
          dimensions of our universe (along the hypothetical Z axis,
          there).
Everyone: [gasps]
   Frink: This forms a three-dimensional object known as a "cube", or a
          "Frinkahedron" in honor of its discoverer, n'hey, n'hey.
   Homer: [disembodied] Help me!  Are you helping me, or are you going
          on and on?
   Frink: Oh, right.  And, of course, within, we find the doomed
          individual.
-- The frightening conclusion, 

Wiggum: Enough of your borax, poindexter!  We need action --
         [fires his gun six times through the wall]
        Take that, you lousy dimension!
         [the bullets fly toward Homer, but spiral around the widening
        hole and get sucked into it]
 Homer: Oh, there's so much I don't know about astrophysics.  I wish I'd
        read that book by that wheelchair guy.
-- Homer, Hawking ignoramus, 

He leans into the hole, but his head gets sucked in and elongated
grotesquely.  He manages to pull it out, but the hole begins widening
with an alarming rapidity.  He has to run to keep ahead of it.

  Abe: [wearing a diving suit] I'll save Homer!  All I needs is four
       stout men to work the bellows.
Frink: No, pops, it's too risky!  For all we know, there could be cubes
       in there the size of gorillas and other large --
Homer: [disembodied] Help!  I don't have much time.
 Bart: [tying a rope around his waist] That does it.  I'm going in.
Marge: Bart, no!
        [Bart goes in through the wall and looks around]
 Bart: Cool, man!
-- Bart enters 3D land, 

Homer is nearing the edge of the green grid.

  Homer: [panicky] Oh my God, I'm going to be sucked into a black hole,
         I'm going to be sucked into oblivion, I'm going to be nothing,
         and what's going to be coming out the other side, I don't know!
   Bart: I'll save you, Dad!
          [climbs onto XYZ street sign]
         I can't get any closer...you'll have to jump!
  Homer: Piece of cake, son.
          [runs into hole, breaks into pieces]
         Crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap --
          [the world explodes in a flash as Bart gets pulled back]
  Marge: Bart!  What happened?
   Bart: Well...we hit a little snag when the universe sort of collapsed
         on itself.  But Dad seemed cautiously optimistic!
  Homer: [disembodied] Craaaap!
  Marge: Oh, Homey.
Lovejoy: Be strong, Marge: I'm sure he's gone to a better place.
          [lightening fizzles; Homer appears in our world, screaming,
         and falls into a dumpster]
  Homer: D'oh!  [gets out] Ew...this is the worst place yet.
-- He's got that right., 

He walks down a street somewhere in California.  People stop to look at
the stranger from another universe.  Homer whimpers incoherently as he
keep walking, but then he spots a store he likes.  "Ooh!  Erotic cakes,"
he coos, walking in.

[End of Act Three.  Time: 21:27]

The credits are displayed in green as the camera slowly rises over the
erotic cakes shop.  The theme song sounds as though it's from the video
game "Myst".  Similar-style music plays over the Gracie logo.
 EPISODE TITLE: King- Size Homer


EPISODE SUMMARY:  (courtesy of Gary Goldberg)
[Syndication cuts are marked in curly braces "{}" and are courtesy of
Frederic Briere.]

Smithers and two goons knock loudly at the door of the men's room at the
Nuclear Power Plant.

Smithers: Come on Simpson, open up!  We know you're in there.
           [The goons break the door open.]
           [looking under stalls] Mmm...[points to stall] that one.
           [The goons bust it open.]
   Homer: [gasps] Someone's in here.
           [Homer whimpers and whines while being dragged off.]
          No...No!  Oh!  For the love of...
Smithers: Boy, I've never seen a man so desperate to get out of five
          minutes of calisthenics.
-- Homer, king of bad health, "King-Size Homer"

All of the plant employees are outside, preparing to exercise.
Montgomery Burns addresses the employees.

Burns: One, two, three, four.  Up, down, three, four.
        [Homer sweats, gasps, and stammers.]
 Carl: This new exercise program is great.
Lenny: Yeah, every muscle in my body is getting a workout, especially my
       big fat mouth.
Homer: Yeah, especially your big fat...oh wait.
Burns: Raise your right huck, aerate.
       Raise you left huck, aerate.
       I want to see more Teddy Roosevelts and less Franklin Roosevelts!
-- Burns waxes poetic, "King-Size Homer"

Homer tries to do a push-up.

Homer: [struggling to complete a pushup] Two!
Lenny: Actually Homer, that's just one.  See, each pushup includes both
       an up part and a down part.
Homer: D'oh!  Hey, where's Charlie?  How'd he get out of this?
 Carl: Uh, he's at home on disability.
Lenny: Yeah, he got injured on the job and they sent him home with pay.
       [scoffs] It's like a lottery that awards stupidity.
Homer: Stupidity, eh?
-- At that, Homer's a viking, "King-Size Homer"

Homer wanders around, muttering "Must hurt self, must hurt self, must
hurt self..." He spies a "Hardhat Area", with signs warning of careless
workers above.  A wrench falls, and he runs over to stand where it fell
-- only to have a bucket of nails fall in the place which he just ran
from.  "D'oh!"  He runs back.  A workman walks over, and a wheelbarrow
of bricks falls on him.  "Hmm," muses Homer, "probably better that
didn't hit me."

Homer pours oil on the floor and, getting a running start, slides
through it, past several monitoring stations and Smithers, and into
Burns office, where he comes to a stop.

Burns: Yes?
Homer: [pause] Hello.
Burns: May I help you?
Homer: Uh...could you give me a little push in the opposite direction?
Burns: [slowly] Okay.
        [Burns pushes Homer in the other direction using a long wooden
       pointer.]
Homer: Thank you.
-- Homer's self-injury attempt through oil fails, "King-Size Homer"

Later, Homer is reading through a book called "Am I Disabled?

Homer: "Carpal tunnel syndrome"...no.
       "Lumber lung"...no.
       "Juggler's despair"...no.
       "Achy breaky pelvis"...no.  Oh, I'm never going to be disabled!
       I'm sick of being so healthy.
       Hey, wait...hyper-obesity!  "If you weigh more than 300 pounds,
       you qualify as disabled."
-- A fanfare plays, "King-Size Homer"

Homer imagines a mountain with 300 lbs. as the goal at the top, A
tuxedo-ed pig appears at his shoulder.

  Pig: You can do it, old boy!
Homer: Yes I can!
        [Runs up mountain, then turns and runs back to pig and takes a
       bite of his arm.]
  Pig: Yes...that's the spirit!
-- Homer climbs the metaphorical mountain of weight gain, "King-Size
    Homer"

Cut to the Simpsons' living room.  Bart is sitting on the couch.

 Bart: If you gain 61 pounds they'll let you work at home?
Homer: Y'uh huh, that's the deal.  No more exercise program, no more
       traffic, no more blood drives or charity walks.
 Bart: Dad, I know we don't do a lot together but helping you gain 61
       pounds is something I want to be a part of.
        [Lisa swings here chair around, unexpectedly appearing.]
 Lisa: Dad!
Homer: [frightened] Aah!
 Lisa: I must protest.  You're abusing a program intended to help the
       unfortunate.
Homer: Hee hee hee, I'm not saying it isn't sleazy, honey, but try to
       see it my way: all my life I've been an obese man trapped inside
       a fat man's body.
 Lisa: Have you told Mom about this?
Homer: No, it would only worry her.  If you want to add to her worries,
       go ahead.  I guess _I'm_ just a little more grateful for all the
       things she's done for us.
-- Backwards rationalizing, "King-Size Homer"

       Lisa: [annoyed] Dad!
      Homer: Yes, sweetheart?
       Lisa: Obesity is really unhealthy; any doctor will tell you that.
      Homer: Oh yeah?  Well we'll just see about that little miss smart
             guy!
              [Cut to Dr. Hibbert's office.]
Dr. Hibbert: [gasps] My God, that's monstrous.  I've never heard of
             anything so negligen -- I'll have no part of it!
              [Turns his back on Homer.]
      Homer: Can you recommend a doctor who will?
    Hibbert: [turns around again] Yes.
-- And that doctor is..., "King-Size Homer"

Dr. Nick Riviera walks into the room.

  Dr. Nick: Hi everybody!
Homer+Bart: Hi Doctor Nick!
      Nick: Now there are many options available for dangerously
            underweighted individuals like yourself.  I recommend a slow
            steady gorging process combined with assal horizontology.
     Homer: [pensive] Of course.
      Nick: [points to a chart] You'll want to focus on the neglected
            food groups such as the whipped group, the congealed group
            and the chocotastic!
     Homer: What can I do to speed the whole thing up, Doctor?
      Nick: Well...be creative.  Instead of making sandwiches with
            bread, use poptarts.  Instead of chewing gum, chew bacon,
            heh...
      Bart: You could brush your teeth with milkshakes!
  Dr. Nick: Hey, did you go to Hollywood Upstairs Medical College too?
            And remember, if you're not sure about something, rub it
            against a piece of paper.  If the paper turns clear, it's
            your window to weight gain.  Bye bye, everybody!
-- Bye, Dr. -- oh, forget it, "King-Size Homer"

Cut to supermarket.

Homer: Oh, it's a dream come true, boy.  I can -- nay I must -- eat
       everything I've always wanted.  Now come on, every second I'm out
       of bed I'm burning precious calories.  Now get grabbing!
-- Shopping becomes fun, "King-Size Homer"

Homer and Bart grab assorted disgusting fattening foods and throw them
in the shopping cart while joyful music plays.  Cut to ice cream shop
where Homer is gorging a sundae.

Homer: [stuffing himself] Ahhh!
 Bart: Eat around the banana, Dad.  It's just empty vitamins.
-- The secret to eating a banana split, "King-Size Homer"

Cut to health food store.  Homer is stocking up on weight gain products.
The cashier observes, "Lucky for you this stuff doesn't work."

Cut to Krusty Burger.  Homer is surrounded by empty wrappers.  Bart
offers him the last sandwich.  Homer says, "I don't know.  Fish
sandwich...are you sure?"  Bart rubs the sandwich on the wall until the
wall turns clear, which is all the excuse Homer needs.  A bird flies
into the newly clear wall.

Cut to Simpsons' bathroom.  Homer steps on the scale.

Homer: [whines] Ohh...225!  That means I lost weight!
 Bart: Ahem...Homer, you're, uh, on the towel rack.
        [Homer moves his stomach blubber.  Scale shows 296.]
Homer: Woo hoo!  Four more pounds and my dream comes true: working at
       home.
-- So close, "King-Size Homer"

Homer fantasizes about how his life will become once he starts working
at home.  He sits outside wearing sunglasses at his work station under a
sun umbrella.

Marge: Here's your lemonade, and here's your beer.  Ooh, you're such a
       vigorous young go-getter.  When's your next coffee break?
Homer: [lascivious] Any time I want...[growls]
        [They giggle.]
-- Homer's dream world, part one, "King-Size Homer"

Homer puts on a record and dance music fills the air.  He and Marge
begin to dance as Flanders pulls into his driveway and walks by, looking
haggard.

Flanders: [moaning] Ohh...
   Homer: Hey, Flanders.  Bad day at the rat races?
Flanders: Yeah, a crazy guy shot a bunch of people and the subway ran
          over my hat.
-- Homer's dream world, part two, "King-Size Homer"

Homer's fantasy life spills over into reality as he dances around the
bathroom by himself.  Bart entreats Lisa to come and see, and she
giggles when she does.  "Neat!"

Cut to Homer and Marge's bedroom.  Marge is laying on the bed reading a
book.  Homer sits down and his weight causes the bed to tilt, throwing
Marge on top of him.

Marge: [getting thrown on top of Homer] Whoa!
Homer: Oh!  Hello, honey.
Marge: Hi.  Erm, there's something I've been meaning to ask you.  Did
       you put on a little weight this week?
Homer: I was going to surprise you, but what the heck: honey, I'm
       purposely gaining 61 pounds to get on disability!
Marge: [gasps] Have you lost your mind?  Have you thought about your
       health...or your appearance?
Homer: Oh.  So that's it, isn't it, Marge?  Looks.  I didn't know you
       were so shallow.
Marge: Oh, please.  I would love you if you weighed 1000 pounds, but --
Homer: Beautiful.  Good night.
        [Quickly turns off light.]
-- Better not hear the end of that sentence, "King-Size Homer"

Cut to Homer and Bart in the living room, before Homer goes to work.
Homer is weighing himself.

Homer: Oh, I've got 15 minutes to gain a pound or I have to face another
       day at work!
 Bart: Bad news, Dad.  We're out of food.  We're even out of the basic
       elements of food.  You ate all the tarragon and you drank all the
       soy sauce.
Homer: I need a miracle.  [Maggie squeezes off some Play-Doh and shapes
       it into a donut, handing it to Homer.]
Homer: Aw, honey, that looks just like a real donut.
 Bart: [goading] Dad...its says its non-toxic.
Homer: [eating it] Well, that's a plus.
        [Eats it and weighs himself again.  Just over 300 lbs.]
       Woo woohoohahoo!, I did it!
 Bart: Uh, Dad, towel rack.
        [Homer removes his blubber from it.  Scale reads 315.]
Homer: [gurgles with delight] oh my.
-- With room to spare, "King-Size Homer"

[End of Act One.  Time: 7:55]

Cut to Homer's new home office.  Many plant personnel are gathered
around for the inauguration ceremony.

   Burns: [clears throat] I'm pleased to dedicate this remote work
          terminal; it will allow our safety inspector here to perform
          his duties from home.  And so excelsior to you, Mr...[to
          Smithers] What's the name of this gastropod?
Smithers: Simpson, Sir.  One of your chair moisteners from Sector 7G.
   Burns: Yes...Simpson!
           [Everyone claps.]
   Homer: [teary] Thank you for your pity.
    Lisa: Mom, were you ever planning to step in and put a stop to this?
   Marge: Normally your father's crackpot schemes fizzle out as soon as
          he finds something good on TV.  But this season...[shudders]
-- The wonder of self-reference, "King-Size Homer"

A member of the press takes a photo of a smiling Burns, whose picture
appears the next day with the headline, "Burns survives shut-in".

Cut to Homer entering "The Vast Waistband", a clothing store.

   Homer: I'm looking for something loose and billowy, something
          comfortable for my first day of work.
Salesman: Work, huh?  Let me guess.  Computer programmer, computer
          magazine columnist, something with computers?
   Homer: Well, I use a computer.
Salesman: [quietly, to self] Yeah, what's the connection?  Must be the
          non-stop sitting and snacking.
           [more audibly] Well, sir, many of our clients find pants
          confining, so we offer a range of alternatives for the ample
          gentleman: ponchos, muumuus, capes, jumpsuits, unisheets,
          muslim body rolls, academic and judicial robes --
   Homer: I don't want to look like a weirdo.  I'll just go with a
          muumuu.
-- Homer, inconspicuous, "King-Size Homer"

Homer walks out in a blue muumuu with red flowers on it as people around
the mall turn to stare.

Cut to Homer's bedroom, next morning.  The radio is announcing the
morning traffic.

Arnie: Arnie Pie in the sky with the morning commute.  Traffic this
       morning is as bad as it gets.  Due to a fire at the Army testing
       lab, a bunch of escaped infected monkeys are roaming the
       expressway.  Despite the sweltering heat, don't unroll your
       windows, 'cause those monkeys seem confused and irritable.
Homer: Hee hee hee.  I pity those poor suckers on the freeway.  Gas
       break honk.  Gas break honk.  Honk honk punch.  Gas gas gas.
        [Walks to terminal.]
       8:58, first time I've ever been early for work.  Except for all
       those daylight savings days.  Lousy farmers.
-- Without whom, new obese Homer wouldn't exist, "King-Size Homer"

Homer reads the computer screen.

 Homer: [reading screen] "To Start Press Any Key".  Where's the ANY key?
        I see Esk ["ESC"], Catarl ["CTRL"], and Pig-Up ["PGUP"].  There
        doesn't seem to be any ANY key.  Woo!  All this computer hacking
        is making me thirsty.  I think I'll order a TAB.  [presses TAB
        key] Awp...no time for that now, the computer's starting.
         [reading screen slowly] "Check core temperature, yes slash no."
        [types] Yes.
        "Core temperature normal."  Hmph.  Not too shabby.
        "Vent radioactive gas."  [types] NO.
        "Venting prevents explosi-on."  Heeheee...whoa, this is hard.
        Where's my Tab?  Okay, then, [types] YES, vent the stupid gas.
         [Cut to a farmer tending his corn.  The gas release blows away
        part of the crop.]
Farmer: Oh, no!  The corn.  Paul Newman's gonna have my legs broke.
-- Curse you, popcorn manufacturers, "King-Size Homer"

Cut back to living room.  Bart and Lisa get ready to leave for school.

Homer: [taunting] Bart and Lisa have to go to school, while I get to
       stay at home, naah naah nah naah naah.
 Lisa: I like school.
Homer: Well, why don't you live at it, then?
 Lisa: [drolly] I would if I could.
 Bart: Not me, sister.  When I grow up I want to be a lardo on workman's
       comp, just like Dad.
        [Imagines an older, superfat Bart lying on a bed with media
       people all around him.]
        [Southern accent] I wash myself with a rag on a stick.
        [The media applauds.]
-- Love those sponge baths, "King-Size Homer"

 Lisa: Ew!  Mom, this whole thing is really creepy.  Are you sure you
       won't talk to Dad?
Marge: Mmm, I'd like to, honey, but I'm not sure how.  Your father can
       be surprisingly sensitive.  {Remember when I giggled at his
       Sherlock Holmes hat?  He sulked for a week and then closed his
       detective agency.}
 Lisa: Well, maybe you'll have to hurt his feelings.  The longer he
       lives likes this, the harder it'll be to go back.
Marge: [realizes] You're right.  Maybe if I use my least nagging tone of
       voice...[tries]
       Homer?  [tries again]
       Homer!  [tries again]
       Homer...that's it.  That's the one.  All right, send him on in.
-- Marge finds her center, "King-Size Homer"

Lisa fetches Homer.

 Lisa: Dad?
Homer: Yes, honey?
 Lisa: Um...Mom just baked a cake.
Homer: Ooh!  [walks into kitchen] Huh?
Marge: Homer, we need to have a serious talk.
Homer: You dragged me all the way from work for that?
Marge: Let's quietly and calmly discuss the pros and cons of your
       controversial plan, shall we?
Homer: I --
Marge: Con!  You're endangering your health.
Homer: Pro: I'm drought-and famine-resistant.
Marge: Con!  You're setting a bad example for the children.
Homer: Pro: I, er, don't have to go to work.
Marge: Con!  You're running the air conditioner non-stop.  It's freezing
       in here.
Homer: Pro.  Uh...uh..  I love you?
Marge: Con: I'm finding myself less attracted to you physically.
Homer: Marge, this is everything I've ever dreamed of right here and
       nobody's gonna take it away from me.  You never had faith in me
       before, but let me tell you, the slim lazy Homer you knew is
       dead.  Now I'm a big fat dynamo!  And where's that cake?
Marge: There's no cake.
Homer: [sulking] Oh.
-- The cake was the cheese, "King-Size Homer"

Homer sits at his terminal.

Homer: "Vent radioactive gas?"  [types] Y E S.
       "Sound alertness horn?"  Y E S. [it sounds in the distance]
       "Decalcify calcium ducts?"  Well, give me a Y, give me a...Hey!
       All I have to type is Y. [to Marge] Hey, Miss Doesn't-find-me-
       attractive-sexually-anymore: I just tripled my productivity!
Marge: Good.  Good for you.
Homer: Y. Y. Let's see, so many letters to choose from.  I'll pick Y!
       Y. Y. [sees SLH] Wha -- what the heck are you doing over there?
        [Pushes SLH down to the floor.]
       There, you found the floor.
  SLH: Arf!
Homer: Y, Y, Y. Y. Y.
Marge: I'm going out, I run errands during the day.
Homer: Could you pick me up a lemonade and a beer?
        [The door slams.]
-- Not in this fat lifetime, "King-Size Homer"

{Later, Homer is nodding off at his terminal.  Mail slides through the
slot.}

Homer: {[excited] The mail, the mail is here!
        [Reading.]
       Oooh, an urgent plea from Edward James Olmos.  "Lisa Simpson -
       can you afford to miss another issue of the Utne Reader?"  Heh

Homer: {Washing my fat guy hat, honey.}

Announcer: We now return to "Search for the Son".
    Woman: According to Daddy's will, _I_ inherit the entire plantation.
      Man: I'll see to it you don't get apricot one!
-- Homer watches daytime TV, "King-Size Homer"

Homer uses a broom to hit at the keyboard in the general vicinity of the
"Y" key.  Several kids gather outside to watch him through the window.

Milhouse: Uh...what's your dad's job again?
    Bart: He's a nuclear safety technician.
  Nelson: What's he doing with that broom?
    Bart: [sheepish] Uh...what isn't he doing?
   Jimbo: I heard that guy's ass has its own congressman.
           [laughs, gives Nelson a high five]
    Lisa: Hey, leave my dad alone.  Just because he's overweight doesn't
          mean he's bad: he's a sweet man and he has real feelings.
   Homer: [inside] Hey, what are you kids looking at?
Milhouse: Hey, look he's trying to get up and yell at us!
   Homer: Don't make me close that shade!
           [pokes window with broom, then loses interest]
-- Idle threats -- literally, "King-Size Homer"

 Bart: Hey, Homer, you promised Mom you wouldn't wear your dress
       outside.
Homer: Nuts to that.  I'm going to the movies.
 Lisa: Shouldn't you be working?
Homer: I've got someone to cover for me.
        [Camera shows drinking bird repeatedly pressing 'Y' on the
       keyboard.]
-- That's using its head, "King-Size Homer"

Homer goes off to "Honk If You're Horny!" starring Faye Dunaway and
Pauly Shore.

    Homer: One for "Honk", please.
Ticketeer: Oh.  Gee, uh, just a minute.  I have to check with the
           manager.
            [to manager] That overweight guy wants to see the movie.
  Manager: I'm terribly sorry, sir, but I'm afraid our facilities are
           not equipped to meet your needs.
    Homer: What are you talking about?
  Manager: What I'm saying, sir, is that a man of your carriage couldn't
           possibly fit in our seats.
    Homer: I can sit in the aisle.
  Manager: I'm afraid that would violate the fire code.
Bystander: Hey, Fatty!  I've got a movie for ya: "A Fridge Too Far"!
           [HA]
-- Low fat-jokes, "King-Size Homer"

The rapidly-assembling crowd laughs.

  Homer: Shame on all of you.  Give me my dignity!  I just came here to
         see "Honk If You're Horny" in peace.
Manager: Sir, if you'd just quiet down, I'd be happy to treat you to a
         garbage bag full of popcorn.
  Homer: This may surprise you, but you can't buy me off with food.  I'm
         sick of all your stereotypes and cheap jokes!  The overweight
         individuals in this country are just as smart and talented and
         hard working as everybody else.  And they're going to make
         their voices heard!  All they need is a leader.
          [doffs his cape and struts off]
         Hmph...I'll work harder than ever before and show the world
         that overweight people are not undisciplined, lazy and
         irresponsible.

Homer: "Explosion imminent?"
        [scrolls back through text, sees gas wasn't vented]
       Oh my God!  The plant's going to explode!

 Carl: Hey, that thing's going kaka cuckoo.
Lenny: Who cares?  It's Homer's problem.
-- Abrogation of duty, "King-Size Homer"

          a time]
Operator: The fingers you have used to dial are too fat.  To obtain a

   Homer: [screams] Aah!
-- Clever diagnostic messages, "King-Size Homer"

Homer: I'm going to have to shut it down myself.  Fat, don't fail me

       in, because I'm a big fat guy and I can't go anywhere!  Because
       there could be some poison gas, I I mean there's really going to
       be poison gas, and everybody's going to be dead, Especially me!

       D'oh!
-- So much for plan A, "King-Size Homer"

An ice cream truck drives into view.  Homer flags it down and starts
blabbering again.

Vendor: [frightened] Take anything you want, man!  Take it all!
-- Homer vs. Big Chief Krazy Kone, "King-Size Homer"

Homer pushes him out of the truck and drives away.  Cut to Burns and
Smithers leading exercise at the SNPP.  Burns entreats, "Push out the
jive...bring in the love."  On the school bus, Ralph is sitting behind
Lisa.

Ralph: I heard your dad went into a restaurant and ate everything in the
       restaurant and they had to close the restaurant.
 Lisa: Hey, my dad may have gained a little weight, but he's not some
       kind of food-crazed maniac.
Homer: [driving past the bus, stuffing his face] Oh, that's raspberry!
-- Well, not usually, anyway, "King-Size Homer"

Homer crashes through the gate at the SNPP.  The exercise crowd gets
excited upon seeing the ice-cream truck.

Burns: Workers, please!  There will be time for the frozen pudding wagon
       later.  You still owe me ten more Iroquois Twists!
        [The crowd obeys.]
       Ten Hi Ya Ya...
        [shout]
       and Nine Hi Ya Ya...
-- Aerobatic devotion, "King-Size Homer"

Homer drives up the side of one of the cooling towers, some workers
holding frantically onto the sides of the truck.

    Homer: Get away, damn it!  Run for your lives!
Worker #1: I'll take a rocket pop!
Worker #2: What can I get for thirty cents!?
    Homer: Let go, I've got to get to the tank!
            [the truck crashes and tips on its side; Homer runs out]
Worker #3: Heck, I can't decide without the pictures.
-- "King-Size Homer"

Homer climbs the side of the ready to burst tank.  He passes signs
pointing to the "manual shutdown" switch.  As the workers count off the
last few Iroquois Twists, Homer struggles to reach the switch, only to
fall and grab clutching at the catwalk above the tank.  "Stupid switch!"
he laments, "I wish I had my reaching broom!  Wait a minute, there's
probably a --" The tank explodes, venting green gas with great force.
Homer falls screaming into the tank opening, his tremendous girth
sealing the opening and ending the crisis.

Later, all the employees gather to applaud Homer.

Burns: Homer, your bravery and quick thinking have turned a potential
       Chernobyl into a mere Three Mile Island.  Bravo!
        [Places an award around Homer's neck.]
 Lisa: I think it's ironic that Dad saved the day while a slimmer man
       would have fallen to his death.
 Bart: And I think it's ironic that for once Dad's butt prevented the
       release of toxic gas --
Marge: Bart!
Burns: [to Homer]
       We'll have you out of there as soon as our tech boys get you
       decontaminated.
Homer: Thank you Mr. Burns --
        [giggles as the technicians hose off his lower half]
       It was pretty scary up there -- [laughs] -- for a while I feared
       for my life -- [laughs more]
Burns: Now Homer, if there's anything else I can do for you...please
       don't hesitate to ask.
Homer: [gazing at Marge before answering]
       Mr. Burns, can you make me thin again?
Burns: I guarantee it.
-- Give him a week..., "King-Size Homer"

Cut to the exercise yard at night.  Mr. Burns is leading a chant while
Homer tries to do sit-ups.

Burns: One...ONE....ONE!
        [Homer struggles to do one situp.]
       Bah, I'll just pay for the blasted liposuction!
Homer: Woo hoo!

[Syndication cuts are marked in curly braces "{}" and are courtesy of
Frederic Briere.]

Mr. Burns, wearing a hardhat and vest, stands next to a sign announcing
"This highway maintained by BurnsoDyne".

   Burns: Here's your caption, boys: "Local hero shuns spotlight and
          pitches in!"
Smithers: What an angle!
           [reporters take photos of Burns]
           [he throws the hardhat down with a grunt and walks away]
   Lenny: I can't believe I'm spending half my Saturday picking up
          garbage.  I mean, half these bottles aren't even mine!
   Burns: Ahem.  Let's have less _con_versation and more _san_itation.
-- Shuns spotlight in photos only, 

The workers pick up various pieces of garbage: run over frogs,
straitjackets, and a bird's nest.

    Carl: Hey, where's Homer?  How'd he get out of this?
   Homer: [from the top of a cliff] Hey, everybody!  Up here!
Smithers: Simpson, stop frolicking and get to work!
   Homer: Right away, Mr. Smithers.  I'll just walk across these
          slippery rocks -- aah!  [falls]
-- When frolicking goes awry, 

Lenny and Carl narrate the action.

    Carl: Oh no!  He's going over the falls!
   Lenny: Oh good.  He snagged that tree branch.
    Carl: Oh no!  The branch broke off!
   Lenny: Oh good.  He can grab onto them pointy rocks.
    Carl: Oh no!  Them rocks broke his arms and legs.
   Lenny: Oh good.  Those helpful beavers are swimming out to save him.
    Carl: Oh no!  They're biting him, and stealing his pants.
           [Homer rushes toward a dam with a giant turbine]
Smithers: Good Lord...he'll be sucked into the turbine!
           [Homer swirls around then gets sucked in]
           [the workers gasp, then bow their heads]
   Burns: [rolling down window] Smithers, who was that corpse?
Smithers: Homer Simpson, Sir.  [sniffs] One of the finest, bravest men
          ever to grace sector 7G.  [sobs]
           [in a normal voice] I'll cross him off the list.
           [at the top of the falls, Bart and Homer chuckle]
    Bart: That dummy worked like a charm, Dad.
   Homer: Best 600 bucks I ever spent.  Come on, boy: we've earned this
          Saturday, now let's make the most of it!
-- Pure genius, 

The camera shows a pair of kites in the sky, then follows the strings
down to Marge and Lisa flying them in the back yard.  Homer, on the
other hand, lies in the hammock counting the number of times Bart
hammers one of the concrete slabs that make up their back deck.

The Springfield Shopper announces Homer's death and loss of pants, and
shows photos of the four beavers who tried to rescue him.  The doorbell
at the Simpson house rings, and Marge answers it.

Lovejoy: Marge, we can't tell you how sorry we are.
    Ned: You have our deepest condol-diddely-olences.
          [stammering] I'm sorry, I'm just nervous: I didn't mean any
         disrespect.
  Marge: What are you talking about?
    Ned: You know...Homer's passing.
          [Marge looks blankly]
         Away.
          [Marge looks blankly]
         Into death.
  Marge: What?!  [looks at paper] That's ridiculous!  Homer's not dead.
         He's right out back in the hammock.
          [they all go out back; the hammock is now empty]
    Ned: Oh, Marge, of course Homer's alive: he's alive in all our
         hearts.
  Maude: Yes, Marge -- I can see him.
   Lisa: [skipping by] Hi everybody!
Lovejoy: Marge, I'm going to give you the card of our juvenile
         counselor.
-- Tim, always helpful, 

The front door is now surrounded with flowers and wreaths.  Once again
the doorbell rings, and Marge answers it.

  Marge: A tombstone?!
  Patty: It came with the burial plot, but that's not important: the
         important thing is, Homer's dead.
  Selma: We've been saving for this since your wedding day.
  Marge: Get out of here, you ghouls!  [shuts door] Ay-yi-yi-yi-yi.
          [the power goes off] Huh?
          [Marge goes to window, sees a man cutting the lines]
         Uh, excuse me!  Sir?  I think there's been a mistake.
Workman: Oh, no, no mistake.  Your electricity's in the name of Homer J.
         Simpson, deceased.  The juice stays off until you get a job or
         a generator.  Oh, and, uh, my deepest sympathies.
          [Marge shuts the window and grunts]
  Marge: Homer?
  Homer: [walking in] That's my name.
  Marge: When I asked you if that dummy was to fake your own death, you
         told me no.  You go downtown first thing in the morning and
         straighten this out.
   Lisa: {Mom!  Dad!  Bart ran into a doorframe and bit his tongue.}
   Bart: {[lisping] What the hell's going on heah?}
-- It's just Homer faking his own death again, 

Homer goes off to the Springfield Hall of Records to talk to the
bureaucrats.

     Homer: Listen here: my name is Homer J. Simpson.  You guys think
            I'm dead, but I'm not.  Now I want you to straighten this
            out without a lot of your bureaucratic red tape and mumbo-
            jumbo!
Bureaucrat: [typing] OK, Mr. Simpson, I'll just make the change here...
            and you're all set.
     Homer: I don't like your attitude, you water-cooler dictator.  What
            do you have in that secret government file anyway?  I have a
            right to read it.
Bureaucrat: [spinning monitor around] You sure do.
     Homer: [reading] "Wife: Marjorie.  Children: Bartholomew, Lisa" --
            aha!  See?  This thing is all screwed up!  Who the heck is
            Margaret Simpson?
Bureaucrat: Uh, your youngest daughter.
     Homer: [mocking] "Uh, your youngest daughter".  Well how about
            this?  This thing says my mother's still alive; she died
            when I was a kid!
             [goes to window] See that stone angel up there?  That's my
            mother's grave.  My dad points it out every time we drive
            by.
Bureaucrat: Mr. Simpson, uh...maybe you should actually go up there.
-- A new idea, 

Homer goes up and brushes the foliage out of the way of the inscription
on the tombstone.

      Homer: Mom, I'm sorry I never come to see you.  I'm just not a
             cemetery person.  "Here lies" --
             Walt Whitman?!  Aargh!  Damn you, Walt Whitman!
              [kicking grave] I!  Hate!  You!  Walt!  Freaking!
             Whitman!  "Leaves of Grass", my ass!
             Wait a minute...maybe it's that other grave: the one that
             says "Simpson"!
              [goes over to it, sees his own name] Aaah!  Oh, why does
             my death keep coming back to haunt me?
              [falls in grave]
    Grandma: You awful, awful man!  Get out of my son's grave.
      Homer: I hate to rain on your parade, Lady, but this is _my_ grave
             -- hey, wait a minute.  Mom?
    Grandma: Homer?
              [they look at each other]
      Homer: I thought you were dead!
    Grandma: I thought _you_ were dead!
Gravedigger: {Well, dang blast it, isn't anybody in this dag gummed
             cemetery dead?}
       Hans: {[in a coffin] I didn't want to cause a fuss, but now that
             you mention it --}
-- The almost-passing of Moleman in the Morning, 

[End of Act One.  Time: 5:17]

Homer and his mother look at each other while his mother rubs his arm.

Grandma: Homer, you grew up so handsome.
  Homer: Some people say I look like Dan Aykroyd.
         I can't believe you're here!  Dad always told me you died while
         I was at the movies.
Grandma: Oh, my poor baby.  You must have been so upset.  But I suppose
         Abe has his reasons.
  Homer: {Yeah.}  Well, where have you been all this time?
Grandma: It's...a very complicated story.  Let's just enjoy this moment.
  Homer: Ma, there's something you should know about me: I almost always
         spoil the moment.
          [a pelican lands on his head and spits a fish into his pants]
         I'm sorry.
Grandma: That's OK, darling: it wasn't your fault.
-- The first meeting in 27 years, 

Homer brings his mother home to the family.

  Homer: Hey, everybody!  I've got a big surprise for you!
         Presenting...my mother!
          [everyone drops their food and talks incredulously]
Grandma: [awkward] Hello.
   Lisa: This is so weird.  It's like something out of Dickens...or
         "Melrose Place".
   Bart: Where have you been, Granny?  Did they freeze you or something?
Grandma: Oh, my, such clever grandchildren.  So full of questions and
         bright, shiny eyes.
  Marge: I don't know what to say: I finally have a mother-in-law.
          [laughs nervously] No more living vicariously through my
         girlfriends.  [laughs more, then coughs]
   Bart: Hey, since you were a no-show at all the big moments of my
         life, you owe me years of back presents: Christmases,
         birthdays, Easters, Kwanzas, good report cards --
          [grabbing a calculator] Hmm, 75 bucks a pop plus interest and
         penalties...you owe me $22,000
  Homer: I'll Kwanza you!  [strangles Bart]
Grandma: Homer, don't be so hard on little -- [whispering] what is his
         name?
-- 

Homer takes his mother upstairs.

  Homer: This is my room, and this is my dresser.  It's where I keep my
         shirts when I'm not wearing them.
Grandma: Oh, yes, right in the drawers.
          [they both laugh]
  Homer: [sighing] You remembered.  Oh, I've missed moments like this...
         Mom.
-- Homer says an unfamiliar word, 

 sits with Lisa on the front step of the house.

Grandma: I saw all your awards, Lisa.  They're mighty impressive.
   Lisa: Aw, I just keep them out to bug Bart, heh.
Grandma: [reproachful] Don't be bashful.  When I was your age, kids made
         fun of me because I read at the ninth-grade level.
   Lisa: Me too!
  Homer: [walking on his hands] Hey, Mom!  Look at me!  Look at what I
         can do!
Grandma: I see you, Homer.  That's _very_ nice.
          [to Lisa] Although I hardly consider "A Separate Peace" the
         ninth-grade level.
   Lisa: Shyeah, more like preschool.
Grandma: I hate John Knowles.
   Lisa: Me too.
          [they both laugh, then sigh]
  Homer: Mom!  You're not looking!
Grandma: You know, Lisa, I feel like I have an instant rapport with you.
   Lisa: [gasps] You didn't dumb it down!  You said "rapport".
-- Lisa shares a touching moment, 

Suddenly, Mother looks worried, then says "Gotta run: Grandma stuff,"
and tears inside the house.  Lisa sees a police car drive slowly by, and
her suspicions are raised.

She takes Bart downstairs to the laundry room.

Lisa: [turning on dryer] There, now no one should be able to hear us.
Bart: What?
Lisa: [turning off dryer] All right, we don't need the dryer.
Bart: What?
Lisa: Just shut up and listen!  There's something fishy about Grandma:
      whenever we ask her where she's been all this time, she changes
      the subject.  And just now, when a police car drove by, she ran
      into the house.
Bart: Yeah, I don't trust her either.  When I was going through her
      purse, look what I found!
       [hands Lisa some driver's licenses]
Lisa: [reading] Mona Simpson...Mona Stevens...Martha Stewart...Penelope
      Olsen...Muddy Mae Suggins?  These are the calling cards of a con
      artist.
-- The truth comes out, 

Homer dances around in the bedroom

Homer: Woo hoo!  I'm so glad to have my mom back.  I never realized how
       much I missed her!
Marge: [pause] She's nice.
Homer: But...?
Marge: I just don't think you should get too excited about the woman who
       abandoned you for 25 years.  You could get hurt again.
Homer: First, it wasn't 25 years -- it was 27 years.  And second, she
       had a very good reason.
Marge: Which was...?
Homer: [pause] I dunno.  I guess I was just a horrible son and no mother
       would want me.
Marge: Oh, Homey, come on.  You're a sweet, kind, loving man.  I'm sure
       you were a wonderful son!
Homer: [unhappy] Then why did she leave me?
Marge: Let's find out.
-- Yes, let's, 

Grandma Simpson reads "Steal This Book" on the couch as the family
approach her.

  Marge: , we'd like to ask you a few questions about your
         past.
Grandma: Can't reminisce, sleeping.  [snores]
   Bart: Spill it, Muddy Mae, or we're calling the cops!
Grandma: Please don't.
   Lisa: All right, then we'll call your husband Grampa!
Grandma: No!  I'll talk.  I'll tell you everything -- I've wanted to
         tell you.
-- Good old-fashioned interrogations, 

Grandma: It all started in the 60s...
          [flash to young Homer playing "Operation"]
  Homer: "Take out wrenched ankle."
          [getting electrocuted] Mom!  Mom!  Mooom!
Grandma: [running in] Oh, my little Homey bear.  [kisses him] Time for
         bed.
  Homer: [getting in] Sing me my bedtime song, Mom.
Grandma: [singing] Ooey, gooey, rich and chewy inside,
         Golden flaky, tender caky outside,
         Wrap the inside in the outside, is it good?
  Homer: Darn tootin'.
Grandma: Doing the [with Homer] big fig newton!  Here's the tricky part.
          [Homer falls asleep]
-- A novel idea for a lullaby, 

She walks out to where Abe is watching TV.

Grandma: Abe, isn't Homer cute?
    Abe: Probably.  I'm trying to watch the Super Bowl.  If people don't
         support this thing, it might not make it.
 Cosell: [on TV] Joe Willy Namath, swaggering off the field, his
         sideburns an apogee of sculpted sartorium -- the foppish
         follicles pioneered by Ambrose Burnside, Appomattox 1865.
          ["Sunshine of Your Love" starts playing]
Grandma: [voice over] His wild, untamed facial hair revealed a new world
         of rebellion -- of change.  A world where doors were open for
         women like me.  [music stops]
         But Abe was stuck in his button-down plastic-fantastic Madison
         Avenue scene.
    Abe: Look at them sideburns!  He looks like a girl.  Now, Johnny
         Unitas -- there's a haircut you could set your watch to.
-- Madison Avenue indeed, 

  Marge: So , where did your newfound sense of
         irresponsibility take you?
Grandma: I soon found people who shared my views at the state college.
          [shot of hippies demonstrating]
  Crowd: [chanting] Anthrax, gangrene, swimmer's ear!  Get your germ lab
         out of here!
          [Grandma joins the crowd in their chant]
Grandma: [voice over] How could I _not_ become a radical when we were
         fighting a force of pure evil?
  Crowd: Hey, hey, Mr. Burns!  Enough already with the germs!
  Burns: [in a window above] Ho, their flower power is no match for my
         glower power!  [glowers]
          [the crowd disperses]
 Wiggum: [below, guarding the doors] Well that's some nice glowering,
         Mr. B.
-- Some things never change, 

Grandma: [voice over] We'd met the enemy and it was Montgomery Burns.
         Drastic action _had_ to be taken to stop his war machine!
          [in flashback] I put Homer to bed, Abe, and now I'm going out.
         It could be a late night -- I'm meeting my destiny.
    Abe: [not turning around] So long.
          ["Along the Watchtower" plays while the hippies set up a bomb
         inside Burns' lab]
 Hippie: When this baby goes off, Burns' lab is going to be history, man
         -- germ history!  [laughs] Oh man, I got the munchies.
-- It hasn't been years since _he's_ seen a bong, 

When the Spiro Agnew clock's alarm starts ringing, the bomb releases
antibiotics into the air, killing all of Burns' nasty germs.  Wiggum
runs from the cloud of gas.

 Wiggum: [gasping, panting] No...no!  Wait a minute --
          [tries breathing] Bronchial tubes clearing...asthma
         disappearing!  Acne remains, but...asthma disappearing.
          [an alarm bell goes off]
  Burns: [running toward the building] My germs, my precious germs!
         They never harmed a soul.  They never even had a chance!
         Whoever did this will never get past me --
          [the crowd of hippies runs out the door and tramples him]
Grandma: [going back] You poor man...let me help you up.
          [she does so; Burns sees her and smiles]
  Burns: _You_ just made a very big mistake.  You'll spend the rest of
         your life in pri --
          [Wiggum slams the door open and crushes Burns behind it]
 Wiggum: My asthma's gone!  Listen to me breathe --
          [snorts] Waaah!  [snorts] Waaah!
-- We'd rather not, thanks, 

         [Grandma runs from Mr. Burns and Wiggum]
Grandma: [voice over] From that moment on, my life as I knew it was
         over.
   Kent: [on TV] Only one member of the Springfield Seven was
         identified.  She's been described as a woman in her early 30s,
         yellow complexion, and may be extremely helpful.  For Channel
         Six News, I'm Kenny Brockelstein.
          [she walks into young Homer's room and looks at him sleeping]
Grandma: Homer...[kisses him, weeps] I'm sorry.
          [walks out]
  Homer: [in the present] I thought I dreamed that kiss.
  Marge: I'm so sorry I misjudged you, Mom.  You had to leave to protect
         your family!
   Lisa: {How did you survive?}
Grandma: {Oh, I had help from my friends in the underground.  Jerry
         Reuben gave me a job marketing his line of health shakes, I
         proofread Bobby Seale's cookbook, and I ran credit checks at
         Tom Hayden's Porsche dealership.}
-- Lucrative underground business dealings, 

  Homer: {Wait a minute...} there's one thing I don't understand.  In
         all those years, why didn't you ever try to contact me?
Grandma: But I did!  I sent you a care package every week.
  Homer: Aw, come on, Mom, we use that same line on the kids when
         they're at camp.
Grandma: But I did, I really did!  I'll prove it to you.
          [they go to the post office]
  Homer: Any undelivered mail for Homer J. Simpson?
    Man: No.  Oh wait, this.  [lifts huge sack of parcels] That's what
         happens when you don't tip your letter carrier at Christmas.
-- A valuable life lesson, 

Mr. Burns mails a letter at another wicket.

Burns: Yes, I'd like to send this letter to the Prussian consulate in
       Siam by aeromail.  Am I too late for the 4:30 autogyro?
  Kid: Uh, I better look in the manual.
Burns: [groans] Oh, the ignorance.
        [sees Homer and Grandma walking out]
       Wait a minute, I know that woman.  But from when?  And in what
       capacity?
        [spies "Wanted" posted with Grandma's young picture on it]
        [gasps] It's her.  At last!
  Kid: This book must be out of date: I don't see "Prussia", "Siam", or
       "autogyro".
Burns: Well, keep looking!
        [he turns back, and she's gone]
-- So close, 

[End of Act Two.  Time: 15:13]

In Burns' office, Joe Friday and Bill Gannon interview Burns about the
incident.

  Friday: Are you sure this is the woman you saw in the post office?
   Burns: Absolutely!  Who could forget such a monstrous visage?  She
          has the sloping brow and cranial bumpage of the career
          criminal.
Smithers: Uh, Sir?  Phrenology was dismissed as quackery 160 years ago.
   Burns: Of course you'd say that...you have the brainpan of a
          stagecoach tilter!
  Gannon: At any rate, the FBI will track down this mystery woman and
          put her behind bars.
           [he and Friday walk out]
          {How does it happen, Joe?}
  Friday: {How does what happen?}
  Gannon: {How does a sweet young lady mortgage her future for a bunch
          of scraggly ideals and greasy-haired promises?}
  Friday: {Maybe she thought the war in southeast Asia was so immoral,
          her end justified the means.}
  Gannon: {Gee, Joe, you haven't been the same since your son went crazy
          in Vietnam.}
  Friday: {It's a pain that never ends.}
-- The "Dragnet" theme plays, 

At home, Lisa jams on her sax with Granny on the guitar.

Grandma: [singing] How many roads must a man walk down before you can
         call him a man?
  Homer: Seven!
   Lisa: No, Dad, it's a rhetorical question.
  Homer: Rhetorical, eh?  Eight!
   Lisa: Dad, do you even know what "rhetorical" means?
  Homer: [incredulous] Do I know what "rhetorical" means?!
-- Apparently, 

         [the doorbell rings]
   Bart: [gasps] Quick, Grandma, hide!
          [Marge closes the curtains]
          [someone pounds on the door, then manages to open it]
    Abe: No door is going to keep me from my meddling!  Stand up
         straight, Bart.
Grandma: [tentative] Abe?
    Abe: [in shock] What the -- [stammers] Now here's a piece of bad
         news.
Grandma: Oh, Abe, you've aged _terribly_.
    Abe: What do you expect?  You left me to raise the boy on my own!
Grandma: I _had_ to leave!  But you didn't have to tell Homer I was
         dead!
    Abe: It was either that, or tell him his mother was a wanted
         criminal!  You were a rotten wife, and I never, _ever_ forgive
         you!  [pause] Can we have sex?  Please?
Grandma: [disgusted] Oh, Abe.
    Abe: Well, I tried!  What's for supper?
-- Cutting his losses, 

Friday and Gannon interview a cab driver.

Cabbie: Yeah, I might have seen her.
Gannon: [typing] Well, according to our computer aging program, she
        should look about...
         [turns screen around; it has a giant "25" on it] 25 years
        older.
Cabbie: Yeah, I seen her!  That is to say, I saw her.
-- Correcting his grammar, 

Grandma Simpson shows the kids how to tie die shirts.  Bart puts one on.

   Bart: Look at me, Grandma: I'm a hippy!  Peace man, groovy!  Bomb
         Vietnam!  Four more years!  Up with people!  [runs off]
   Lisa: You know, Grandma, I used to think that I was adopted.  I
         couldn't understand how I fit into this family.  Now that I met
         you, I suddenly make a lot of sense.  [hugs her]
Grandma: I'm so glad to see the spirit of the 60s is still alive in you
         kids.
          [camera shows Maggie dancing to the "Laugh-In" theme with a
         "Ban the bottle" slogan painted on her stomach]
-- 

The FBI guys interview the gravedigger.

Gravedigger: Yep, I saw her.  That is to say, I seen her.  She seemed
             like a nice lady.
      Burns: Well, that nice lady set the cause of biological warfare
             back thirty years!
   Smithers: We're only now finally caught up.
-- Boo hoo, 

Gravedigger: Two more ladies come by earlier that day.  One was real
             pretty, t'other, sort of plain.
              [the FBI guys, Burns, and Smithers go to the Bouvier
             sisters' house]
     Friday: Ma'am, we're going to need your assistance in locating this
             individual.
      Selma: [giggling] Oh, I'm fresh.  Don't you want to play "Good
             cop, bad cop"?
     Friday: Ma'am, we're all good cops.
      Selma: I had no intention of playing the good cops.
      Burns: Ew.  Look, we know you bought the tombstone, we know the
             fugitive visited that tombstone.  Whose tombstone was it?
      Patty: Just lift up your coffee cups and see.
              [they see Homer's tombstone]
   Smithers: Good Lord!
     Wiggum: Put out an APB on a Uosdwis R. Dewoh.  Uh, better start
             with Greektown.
     Friday: That's "Homer J. Simpson", Chief.  You're reading it upside
             down.
     Wiggum: Uh, cancel that APB.  But, uh, bring back some of them, uh,
             giros.
     Friday: Uh, Chief?  You're talking into your wallet.
-- Joe Friday's sharp eye, 

The newly reassembled Simpson family eats dinner.

    Lisa: Grandma, have you ever thought about moving back to
          Springfield?
   Homer: You could live with Grampa again.
           [everyone, including Abe, laughs]
     Abe: Oh, I'm a living joke.
 Grandma: You know, Lisa, [phone rings] it might be nice to rest for a
          while.
           [Homer answers it, then leans into the doorway]
   Homer: Mom?  There's nothing to be alarmed about, but...could you
          take one last look at the family and join me in the kitchen?
           [outside, a tank and a police car pull up]
   Burns: [in the tank] I've been waiting 25 years for this moment.
           [puts on a tape of "Ride of the Valkyries"]
           [it turns into "Waterloo" by ABBA]
Smithers: I'm sorry, Sir, I must have taped over that.
-- A minor oversight, 

The family look alarmed at the sound of the music.  The tank breaks open
the front door.

  Friday: Freeze.  FBI: the jig is up.
     Abe: All right, I admit it: I am the Lindbergh baby.  Waah!  Waah!
          Goo goo.  I miss my fly-fly dada.
  Friday: Are you trying to stall us, or are you just senile?
     Abe: A little from column A, a little from column B.
Smithers: [panting] Sir!  She's gone.
           [Burns groans]
           [in a remote location in the Springfield badlands]
 Grandma: We made it, Homer!
   Homer: It's all thanks to our anonymous tipster.
           [into the phone] But who are you?  And why did you tip us
          off?
  Wiggum: [on phone] Well, it's 'cause of your old lady that I got rid
          of my asthma that was keeping me out of the academy.
   Homer: Thanks.
  Wiggum: Sure.  Just think of me as an anonymous friend who rose
          through the ranks of the Springfield police to become Chief
          Clancy Wig --
   Homer: [hanging up] Yak, yak, yak, yak, yak!
-- Impatience is a virtue, 

Homer bids his final goodbyes to his mother.

Grandma: Well, there's my ride.  The underground awaits.
  Homer: [sniffles] At least this time, I'm awake for your goodbye.
Grandma: [sniffles] Oh.  Remember, whatever happens, you have a mother,
         and she's truly proud of you.
          [they hug]
 Hippie: Oh!  Hurry up, man.  This electric van only has twenty minutes
         of juice left!
          [Grandma walks into the van]
  Homer: Don't forget me!
Grandma: Don't worry, Homer: you'll always be a part of me.
          [hits her head on doorframe] D'oh!
-- And how!, 

She closes the door and drives off.  Homer watches the van leave, then
sits on the hood of his car until nightfall, staring contemplatively at
the stars.

[End of Act Three.  Time: 21:22]

The closing theme is more somber and placid than usual, with the melody
played by a flute.
 EPISODE TITLE: Sideshow Bob's Last Gleaming


EPISODE SUMMARY:  (courtesy of Gary Goldberg)
The scene opens on Krusty speaking into the camera.

Krusty: I'd like to thank everybody who contributed to Krusty's canned
        food drive.  Your generous donations have made this our
        slipperiest, slimiest slop-stacle course ever!  [laughs]
         [in the background, Mel "goes" through the obstacle course]
        Our contestants will drop out of my nose, and blurp into a tub
        of refried beans.  From there, they'll stumble down a sluice of
        rich, eggy bearnaise sauce.  How can we afford it?  It's rancid!
        Then, at the finish line, a scrumptious parfait of pudding,
        pickle brine and detergent where a writhing pile of kids will
        grope blindly for hot dogs.
   Mel: Krusty, please!  It burns!
-- Krusty, humanitarian, 

Cut to Simpson's Home.  Bart and Lisa are laughing at the onscreen
antics.

 Bart: Aw, just think, Lis: that's _our_ pickle brine burning Sideshow
       Mel.
Homer: Pfft.  That Sideshow Mel think's he's so big.  Whatever happened
       to Sideshow Bob?
 Lisa: Don't you remember Dad?
        [flash to quick scenes of each]
       He framed Krusty, he tried to kill Aunt Selma, he rigged an
       election.
 Bart: And he tried to murder me.
Homer: [in present] Oh yeah.  But what I'll mainly remember is the
       laughter.
-- Joy through selective memory, 

"I wonder what he's doing now?" wonders Homer aloud.  Cut to the
Springwood Minimum Security Prison gate.  The gate is open and
unattended.  Sideshow Bob is building a model building inside a bottle.

        Bob: Ahh, Westminster Abbey.  Edward the Confessor himself could
             not have done better.  Now to set the clocks to Greenwich
             Mean Time.
              [laughing erupts from the nearby room, disrupting Sideshow
             Bob and causing the model to crumble]
              [gasps] My dear abbey!
              [Bob runs to the next room where other prisoners are
             watching Krusty on TV and laughing uproariously]
     Krusty: [on TV] This is the way we mop the floor, mop the floor --
        Bob: Oh, must you bray night and day at that infernal
             television?
Prisoner #1: Oh, look who's talking.
Prisoner #2: Yeah, Bob...You used to be on this show.
        Bob: Don't remind me.  My foolish capering destroyed more young
             minds then syphilis and pinball combined.  Ooh, how I
             loathe that box.  As omnidirectional sludge pump droning
             and burping...
Prisoner #3: [looking like Rupert Murdoch] Look here, that's enough now!
             I own 60% of that network --
              [Attempts to strangle Sideshow Bob.]
     Wiggum: All right, break it up, boys.  It's time for work detail.
              [the prisoners file out for work]
Prisoner #3: [to Bob] I suppose you don't like tabloid newspapers
             either!
-- The corner of the trash market, 

Cut to prison bus entering "U.  S. Air Force Base" which is "Not
Affiliated With U. S. Air".  The prisoners are raking trash from the
grounds.

   Bob: There.  That's the last condom wrapper.
         [a jet flies by, blowing all the neatly piled trash away]
        Oh, I renew my objection to this pointless endeavor!  Informally
        now and by affidavit later.  Time permitting.
Wiggum: Shut your word hole!  We've got to get this place clean for the
        air show.
   Bob: Air show?  Buzz-cut Alabamians spewing colored smoke from their
        whiz jets to the strains of "Rock You Like A Hurricane?"  What
        kind of countrified rube is still impressed by that?
-- Need he ask the question?, 

Cut to Homer, Marge, Lisa and Bart excited by news of the Air Show in
the Springfield Shopper.

All but Marge: Yeah!  Yes.  All right!
        Marge: [drolly] Yeah.
         Lisa: I want to meet the first female Stealth Bomber pilot.
               During the Gulf War she destroyed seventy mosques and her
               name is Lisa too.
         Bart: I want to see some birds get sucked into the engines.
               Rare ones.
        Marge: This year I'm making ear plugs out of biscuit dough.
                [the oven bells sounds]
               They're ready!
-- Better let them cool first, 

Cut back to the minimum security prison at night.  The door is still
ajar.  Bob crawls into bed..."So weary," he yawns, closing his eyes.
His bunkmate turns on a small TV and disturbs his attempt to sleep.
From the TV: "Grandma, this is my friend Craig."  Laughter.  "Friend?
You mean you two aren't knocking boots!?"  More laughter.  "Ever do the
backseat mambo, Craigie?"

Bob: Oh.  I know that voice.  TV's bottomless chum bucket has claimed
     Vanessa Redgrave!
-- A bad Fox special in TV land, 

On TV: "Now I'm going to haul ass to Lollapalooza".  More laughter.
"Yee haw!", Redgrave cries, revving her hog.  Bob bids her teary
farewell as the 20th Century Fox theme plays.

Cut to the next day, at the air base.  Sideshow Bob is polishing a jet.

Wiggum: Hey you!  The state's not paying you five cents an hour to stand
        around.  Now get busy!
   Bob: Oh, I'll get busy.  I'll get very busy indeed.
         [laughs his signature laugh]
Wiggum: [laughs nervously] You still got it, Bob.  Heh.
-- Humorous, even as a criminal, 

Cut to the Simpsons driving into the air base under a sign saying "Air
Show Today."  They drive pass an airman directing traffic.

 Bart: Way to guard the parking lot, Top Gun.
Guard: I have three medals for this.
-- Heroism at its finest, 

The prisoners are boarding the prison bus.

     Wiggum: Hey, where is Sideshow Bob and that guy who, uh, eats
             people and takes their faces?
Prisoner #4: I'm right here, chief!
     Wiggum: Oh.  Then where's Sideshow Bob?
Prisoner #5: Ehh, he ran off.
     Wiggum: Oh, great.  Well, if anyone asks, uh...I beat him to death,
             OK?
        Lou: Right.
-- The most likely explanation, 

The bus pulls away, leaving Sideshow Bob behind.  The Simpsons are
looking at a jet.

Tour guide: At this point in time, I would like to direct your attention
            to the particular air vehicle next to which I am currently
            standing.  The Harrier Jet is one of our more dollar-
            intensive ordnance delivery vectors.
     Marge: Five tires!?  Am I seeing things?
     Guide: And, although it looks complicated it is so well-designed,
            even a child could fly it.
      Lisa: Can I fly it?
     Guide: Of course you can not.
-- Lisa tries to pull a fast one, 

Homer sees a stand apparently offering "Free Duff".

Homer: Free Duff!?  Viva life!
-- Homer at the Air Show, 

He swallows many cups before other people move away to reveal the rest
of the sign saying "Alcohol-Free Duff".  The attendant rings up a $48.00
bill for the drinks.  Homer pretends to faint and sneaks away.

A line of children forms to "Sit in a Real F-15 Fighter."  Milhouse is
sitting in the cockpit, pushing buttons.

Milhouse: [makes machine gun noises] Take that, Mom!
           [makes more noises] Take that, Dad!  Send me to a
          psychiatrist, will you?
           [makes more noises] Take that, Dr. Sally Waxler!  [pushes
          buttons]
           [gets ejected at high-speed]
-- Milhouse at the controls of an F-15, 

Milhouse crashes into the Snack Bar.  Meanwhile, Sideshow Bob is
listening through the window of the base commander's office.  A sergeant
says, "Colonel?  They're expecting you at the podium in ten minutes."
The colonel mumbles a reply.  Sideshow Bob sneaks past, and seeing the
"Colonel's Washroom", enters.  He spies some of the Colonel's towels and
throws them on the ground outside.  He closes the door and waits for the
Colonel, who sees the towels as he walks by.

Hapablap: What in the world according to Garp -- ?  Those are my dress
          towels.
           [tries the locked door]
          Who's in my private washroom?  McGuckett, let me in.
     Bob: [effecting a cornpone accent] The door already is closed.
Hapablap: What?!  This is Colonel Leslie "Hap" Hapablap.  If you don't
          open that door I'll tear you up like a Kleenex at a snot
          party!
     Bob: You say you're in the military?
Hapablap: Sweet Enola Gay, Son!  I'm going to come in there and corpse
          you up -- corpse you up and mail you to mama!
           [breaks the door open and rushes in]
          Well, where'd he go?  Got my knuckles all lined up for
          nothing.
           [kisses his hand]
          Sorry, ladies.
-- Bob spars verbally, 

Sideshow Bob chuckles from the wastebasket as Colonel Hapablap leaves.
Cut to Grampa and Bart standing in front of the Wright Brothers' Model B
plane on display.

  Bart: Look at that hunk of junk.
Grampa: Oh, jeeh -- you're ignorant!  That's the Wright Brothers' plane.
        At Kitty Hawk in 1903, Charles Lindbergh flew it fifteen miles
        on a thimbleful of corn oil.  Singlehandedly won us the Civil
        War, it did.
  Bart: So how do you know so much about American history?
Grampa: I pieced it together, mostly from sugar packets.
-- Bart hisses a mystery lesson, 

Cut to Sideshow Bob, standing in front of the electronically-secured
door of a hangar.  Signs all say "Restricted Area" and "Danger".  He
presses the door buzzer.

Guard: Authorization code?
  Bob: [sounding like Colonel Hapablap] Code?  Son, this is Colonel
       Hapablap.  That fool McGuckett sprayed runway foam all over Chuck
       Yeager's Acura.  Now get down there with the chamois triple time!
Guard: But Colonel, I'm under strict orders...
  Bob: Sweet Enola Gay, son!  Get moving or I'll tear you up like a
       Kleenex at a...
        [disdainful]
       ...snot party.
Guard: Sir!  Right away Sir!
-- Bob's persona slips momentarily, 

The guard runs out of the hanger.  Sideshow Bob catches the door as he
leaves and enters the hanger.  Cut to Homer crossing the bleachers at
the reviewing stand carrying a load of tasty treats for the family.  A
large television screen is off to one side.

Homer: They didn't have any aspirin so I got you some cigarettes.
        [hands Marge a pack of Laramies]
Marge: Mmm.  Maybe my headache will go away once the show starts.
-- Nicotine, the wonder drug, 

The public announce system squeals into operation right over Marge's
head.

Hapablap: Ahem, ladies and gentlemen!  What a day for an air show.  Not
          a cloud in the sky!
           [Bob leaves the hangar pushing a wheelbarrow holding a ten
          megaton nuclear weapon]
     Bob: Except perhaps...a mushroom cloud.
           [laughs his laugh, almost dropping the bomb in the process]
           [resumes laughing more quietly]
-- 

[End of Act One.  Time: 8:05]

The scene opens on Colonel Hapablap speaking at the microphone.

Hapablap: To slip the surly bonds of earth, and touch the face of God.
          To fly -- the dream of man and flightless bird alike.  And
          now, hold on tight, as we blast through the thrilling
          highlights of aviation history!  Say, did somebody say "box
          kites"?
           ["Up, Up and Away" starts]
    Bart: No!
           [everyone groans as kids with box kites walk out]
  Martin: The common box kite was originally used as a means of drying
          wet string.
-- The lame preamble to the air show, 

The music is very load and screechy.  Marge covers her ears.  Sideshow
Bob is busy implementing his plans.

   Marge: Do they have to play that rock music?  Every note is pounding
          into my skull!
           [the central part of the speaker shoots through her hair]
Hapablap: Anybody out there feel the need for speed?
Everyone: Yaya!
   Marge: [drolly] Yat.
Hapablap: Then get ready for the pride of the United States Air Force:
          the British-made Harrier Jump Jet!
           [ets fly by to the tune of "Rock You Like A Hurricane"]
    Lisa: Dad!  Why aren't you looking?
   Homer: Heh heh, why jerk my neck around like a goon when Tyrranno-
          vision decides what I should look at?
-- Thank you, jumbo TV, 

Homer points to the screen where the jets are flying by.  The scene on
the big TV switches to Maggie on Marge's lap.  "Ooh, look! it's Maggie!"
Homer waves his hand in front of Maggie, but the scene changes to
Sideshow Bob.  "Maggie?" asks Homer.

   Bart: [gasps] Sideshow Bob!
          [everyone gasps and screams]
    Bob: [on TV] Hello, Springfield.  Sorry to divert your attention
         from all the big noises and shiny things.  But something's been
         troubling me lately: television!  Wouldn't our lives be so much
         richer if television were done away with?
    Moe: What?!
Hibbert: [scoffs] Surely he's not talking about VH-1.
    Bob: Why, we could revive the lost arts of conversation...and
         scrimshaw.  Thus I submit to you we abolish television,
         permanently!
  Homer: Go back to Massachusetts, pinko!
    Bob: Oh, and one more thing.  I've...stolen a nuclear weapon.  If
         you do not rid this city of television within two hours, I will
         detonate it.  Farewell.
-- Bob's evil parting words, 

The TV turns off.  The crowd begins to panic.  The TV clicks back on
again.

Bob: By the way, I'm aware of the irony of appearing on TV in order to
     decry it.  So don't bother pointing that out.
-- Bob, well-versed in language arts, 

The TV clicks off again.  The crowd begins to run away as an air raid
siren sounds.

Marge: [panicking] Kids!  Everything's gonna be OK!  Don't panic!  Just
       don't panic!
 Lisa: Mom.  Mom!  You're stepping on my heels and knocking my shoes
       off!
Marge: We can always get more shoes!  Move!  Move!  Move!
-- Marge, sage counselor, 

The crowd runs past the entry gate.

Guard: Stamp your hand for reentry.
        [the crowd runs past in a panic]
 Bart: Hey!  Cool!  I want to be around when those guns start going off.
-- The mass exodus from the air show, 

He tuns back in.  Lisa sees him and calls after him, "Bart, no!"  She
runs in after him as the gate closes.

Marge: Wait!  Wait, my children are in there!
Guard: You must be very proud, Ma'am.
-- Thick as a brick, 

Cut to an underground bunker where the city leaders are meeting.

  Quimby: Our city will _not_ negotiate with terrorists!  Is there a
          city nearby that will?
Hapablap: No need, sir.  We'll find that headcase faster than Garfield
          finds lasagna.
           [Quimby looks at him] Oh.  Sorry, my wife thought that was
          gangbusters.
-- Army man's humor, 

Guards are searching the base.  They open the door to a portable toilet
revealing Grampa.

Grampa: This elevator only goes to the basement.  And somebody made an
        awful mess down there.
-- Grampa, stuck in the porta-potty, 

The guards open the doors to Hangar 18, where an extraterrestrial being
is inside.  "Watch out!  He's got his probe!" shouts one man as they
slam the doors closed.

Lisa runs into Colonel Hapablap's office, where Bart is sitting behind
his desk, "flying" the pen and pencil set and making war noises.

Lisa: Bart.  Bart!  What are you doing?  We've got to get out of here.
Bart: Target sighted.  Launching air-to-nerd missile!
       [launches a missile model, hitting Lisa]
Lisa: Owww!  Come on, Mom and Dad are waiting!
       [drags Bart out]
-- Bart fulfills a fantasy, 

Cut back to the underground bunker.

Hapablap: Bob is not here.  We have searched every square inch of this
          base and all we have found is porno, porno, porno!
  Quimby: We have only twenty minutes left.  Send in the esteemed
          representatives of television.
           [Kent Brockman, Chesperito, Krusty and two others file in]
           [Krusty sees the magazines on the table]
  Krusty: Hey, hey!  Now this is my kind of meeting!
  Quimby: Gentlemen, it's time we face up to the un-face-up-to-able.  We
          must sacrifice television in order to save the lives of our
          townspeople.
  Krusty: Whoa!  Whoa-ho-ho!  Let's not go nuts.  Would it _really_ be
          worth living in a world without television?  I think the
          survivors would envy the dead!
           [pause]
  Quimby: I appreciate your passion on behalf of your medium.  But I'm
          afraid we are out of options.  Television must go.  May God
          have mercy on our souls...
-- Prayer to a vengeful God, 

Television transmission towers are destroyed throughout town.

  Brockman: [on air] And as my final newscast draws to a close, I'm
            reminded of a few of the events that brought me closer to
            you: the collapse of the Soviet Union, premium ice cream
            price wars, dogs that were mistakenly issued major credit
            cards, and others who weren't so lucky.  And so, farewell.
            Uh, and don't forget to look for my new column in PC World
            magazine.
Chesperito: [on air] Muchas gracias, Amigos, por tolas las memorias.  Y
            super gracias a Goya.
       Bob: Success!  They're giving in.  Blast!  I should've made more
            demands.  Some decent local marmalade for one.  Oh well,
            next time.
-- Assuming there _is_ one, 

Cut to Krusty in his studio, where the stagehands are breaking down his
set.

Krusty: Aaah!  Not my extendo-glove!  They haven't made those since the
        war.  Oh, not my Paris backdrop!  How am I going to make fun of
        the Frogs!?
        Wait...if I could only stay on the air, I'd have 100% of the
        audience.  Think of the ratings!
-- A plan in the clownish mind, 

Cut back to the air base fence.  Marge is bandaging Homer's hands.

Homer: OK, so we can't go over the fence.
Marge: I feel so helpless.  What if something happens to them?
Homer: I'm sure they're fine, honey.
Marge: Well, at least they're wearing clean underwear.
        [cut to Bart's bed at home, where his underwear is still laid
       out]
        [inside the base]
 Bart: Free and easy, Lis...aaah.  There's nothing like an unfurnished
       basement for pure comfort.
 Lisa: Huh?  Hurry up, Mom and Dad are probably worried sick.
-- More tenets of the Bart philosophy, 

Colonel Hapablap and an aide walk by.

Hapablap: You know what really frosts my Kelvinator?  That friutcup's
          probably still laughing at us from his damn hidey-hole.
    Aide: I'd rather take an order from Bill Clinton then hear that
          guy's snooty, high-toned voice again, Sir!
-- 

The colonel walks by.  Bart and Lisa emerge from the bushes.

Lisa: High-toned voice...Bart, that's it!  I know where Sideshow Bob is
      hiding!
       [they start running]
      When Bob broadcast that message, his voice was higher then normal.
      And what makes your voice high?
Bart: Tight, binding underwear?
Lisa: Helium!  Sideshow Bob is in the Duff blimp!
-- Well, they're both right, 

They run toward the blimp.

      Bob: [high-pitched] All Springfield trembles before the might of
           Sideshow Bob!  Blasted helium!  Shoo...shoo...shoo.
            [normal voice] Ha ha, that's better!
            [turns channels on the TV and sees only static]
           Gone.  [click]
           Gone too.  [click]
           Fabulous.  [click]
           Marvelous.  [click]
            [the Emergency Broadcast System logo appears]
            [Bob begins to walk away until he hears Krusty's voice]
Announcer: This is the Emergency Broadcast System.  Stand by for an
           urgent bulletin.
   Krusty: [on TV] Hey Hey!  [laughs] Krusty the Clown is back on the
           air!  Eight...no no, _twelve_ hours of day.  The only game in
           town!
      Bob: Krusty!  But how?!
   Krusty: I'm comin' at you live from the civil defense shack in the
           remote Alkali Flats of the Springfield Badlands!  I'll be
           beaming out eleven watts of wackiness!  Hour after hour of
           unscripted, unrehearsed comedy.  Featuring...uh...uh...
           Professor Gas Can!  And, uh, [grabs photo] former President
           Ike Eisenhower!  [imitative] Let's get busy!
      Bob: Oh, my utopia lies in ruins!  How naive of me to think a mere
           atom bomb could fell the chattering cyclops!
-- TV, almighty, 

He uncages the red detonator button as Bart and Lisa spring up from the
trap door in the bottom of the blimp.

 Bob: Well, at least I'll have my revenge!
Bart: Bob, no!
Lisa: Don't you see?  That would be taking the easy way out.
 Bob: I agree.  [presses the button]
-- Thinks that make you go "Boom!", 

A blinding flash fills the air.

[End of Act Two.  Time: 16:16]

The scenes flash through people throughout Springfield and then the
mushroom cloud appears, very small, and sets off the smoke detector in
the blimp.  The bomb casing breaks apart and rats scatter.

 Bob: [reading from the bomb casing] "Best before November 1959."
      Dammit, Bob.  There were plenty of brand new bombs, but you had to
      go for that retro 50s charm.
       [to kids] Well, if it isn't my arch nemesis, Bart Simpson.  And
      his sister Lisa to whom I'm fairly indifferent.
Bart: So, Krusty double crossed you.  But your basic plan was pure
      genius.  Where do you get your ideas?
 Bob: Oh please.
       [brandishing a knife from hand to hand]
      Let's not embarrass us both with that hoary old "stall the villain
      with flattery" scheme.
-- The unwritten dignity code for showdowns, "Sideshow Bob's Last
    Gleaming"

Lisa is typing on the console behind Sideshow Bob.

  Bart: I...should have known you were too smart to fall for that.
   Bob: Really?  What type of smart?  Book smart?  Because there are a
        lot of people who are book smart but it takes a special type of
        genius to --
Wiggum: All right Bob, it's over!  Come out with your hands up.
   Bob: No!  How did they find me?
         [electronic sign on side blimp flashes, "HELP!  SIDESHOW BOB IS
        INSIDE!  HIS BOMB WAS A DUD.  THANK YOU.  LISA SIMPSON."]
-- A certain plucky eight-year-old, is how, "Sideshow Bob's Last
    Gleaming"

Sideshow Bob cuts through the side of the blimp which deflates.  He
grabs Bart and heads for the Harrier.

    Lisa: He's getting away!  [gets covered by the blimp]
Hapablap: Oh...not the Harrier!  We've got a war tomorrow.
     Bob: [sees control panel with two buttons, STOP and FLY]
          God bless the idiot-proof Air Force.
-- Oh, he'll bless them, all right, 

He presses the FLY button, and the jet taxis forward into a ditch.
Sideshow Bob switches to the Wright Brothers plane.

   Guard: They're gone!
Hapablap: Hell...not the Wright Brothers plane!  The Smithsonian's gonna
          have my ass on a platter.
-- Bob makes his escape, 

Cut to Homer breaking the entry gate down with his car.  Sideshow Bob
and Bart fly over head as Lisa runs out.

 Bart: Dad!  Help!
Marge: [screams] Ahh!
Homer: Hang on, Boy!  Daddy's coming to save you!
        [rolls over the tire trap and blows all the tires]
       D'oh!
 Lisa: Mom!  I found Sideshow Bob's hideout and I got a secret message
       to the police and I had a blimp fall on me and I was in an atomic
       blast but I'm OK now!
Homer: Well, I wrecked the gate, but you don't hear me bragging.  Now
       let's roll!
-- How easily the young thrill, 

Cut to Sideshow Bob and Bart in the plane.

 Bob: Aah, for the days when aviation was a gentleman's pursuit -- back
      before every Joe Sweatsock could wedge himself behind a lunch tray
      and jet off to Raleigh-Durham.
Bart: [spitting] Are you getting lots of bugs in your mouth too?
 Bob: [pause] Yes.  [spits]
-- Ew, bugs, 

Two jets speed in.

Intercom: Prepare to engage enemy.
           [the jets speed past]
          Bogey's air speed not sufficient for intercept.  Suggest we
          get out and walk.
-- The air force guys in hot pursuit, 

The two pilots do just that.  Homer drives behind the plane.  "Jump,
Boy!  I've got you!" he cries.  "I'm coming!" yells Bart.  He breaks
away from Sideshow Bob.  He throws his backpack to Homer, which falls
beneath the car's wheels and then explodes.

Homer: Now you Boy!
 Bart: [scared] Oh.
        [plane approaches cops standing on their cars]
       You can't escape Bob.  If the tennis rackets don't get you, the
       pool skimmers will.
  Bob: Ooh, I never planned to escape.  You see, this is a kamikaze
       mission!  You and I are going to kill Krusty the Clown!  Hah hah
       hah!
-- The final diabolical plan revealed, 

Bob manages to avoid both the tennis rackets and pool skimmers.  Cut to
Krusty in the civil defense shed.

Krusty: Kids...Itchy and Scratchy can't be here today.  But instead,
        we've got the next best thing!  It's the Stingy and Battery
        show!  They bite.  And light.  And bite and light and...yatta,
        yatta, you know what I'm talking about.
  Bart: You can't kill Krusty: he made you what you are.  Without him,
        you wouldn't even be called Sideshow!
   Bob: Grrrr.
Krusty: [hears noise, stops singing] What the hell is that, a lawnmower?
         [looks out window, sees plane]
        Yiaaah!
  Bart: Get out of the way, Krusty!
-- Portrait of a clown's mortality, 

Krusty jumps through the window.  The plane takes awhile to get there.

Krusty: What is the freaking holdup?
   Bob: Die, Krusty, Die!
-- Slow-motion kamikaze, 

The plane hits the shed and bounces off of it, knocking Sideshow Bob and
Bart to the ground.  A tank rolls in and then over the plane, crushing
it.

 Soldier: Ooh, sorry.  We don't normally drive these in the Air Force.
  Wiggum: [cuffing Bob] Got ya, ha ha, you...TV-hating mutant!
Hapablap: What is your major malfunction, Sideshow Bob?
   Marge: [kisses Bart] My little sugar bug!  [kisses] I'm so glad
          you're safe!
    Bart: But -- but -- but -- Mom!  You're embarrassing me in front of
          the Army guys!
     Bob: How ironic.  My crusade against television has come to end so
          formulaic, it could have spewed from the PowerBook of the
          laziest Hollywood hack.
-- _Could_ have..., 

Grampa pulls up to the shed on a chopped motorcycle.

Grampa: Hey everybody, I'm gonna haul ass to Lollapalooza!
Family: Here we go again!
-- More PowerBook Puke, 

The Twentieth Century Fox logo rolls.

[End of Act Three.  Time: 21:17]
 EPISODE TITLE: The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular


EPISODE SUMMARY: 
Troy: "The Simpsons" began as the brainchild of cartoonist Matt
      Groening,
       [screen shows a bald man with an eyepatch saluting in front of a
      US flag and looking menacing]
      the already-famous creator of such comics as "Damnation", "Johnny
      Reb", and "True Murder Stories".  [screen shows each]
      In 1987, Groening teamed up with award-winning producers James L.
      Brooks
       [shot of 8F01-esque rich man surrounded by bags of money]
      and Sam Simon.
       [shot of Howard Hughes-esque naked man typing in bed]
      And what better place to premiere their creation than on "The
      Tracy Ullman Show", the nation's showcase for psychiatrist jokes
      and musical comedy numbers?  On April 19th, 1987, America first
      met "The Simpsons".
-- From humble beginnings, 

All 1:48 of MG01 ("Good Night") airs.  When the camera returns to Troy,

suddenly and observes, "They haven't changed a bit, have they?"

He continues, "As the weeks went on, so did the cartoons." 0:46 of MG16
("The Perfect Crime") airs, followed by 0:47 of MG13 ("Space Patrol").
Troy resumes, "As wacky as those kids were, they were no match for
`Captain Wacky', later renamed `Homer'." 0:24 of MG20 ("World War III")
airs, followed by 1:06 of MG44 ("Bathtime").

Troy: Maybe the drawings were a little crude, but all the characters
      were there: Itchy &amp; Scratchy,

Just before the commercial break, the announcer asks, "In the opening
credits, what does the cash register say when Maggie is scanned?"

[End of Act One.  Time: 8:33]

Announcer: In the opening credits, what does the cash register say when
           Maggie is scanned?
           The cash register says, "NRA4EVER", just one of the hundreds
           of radical right-wing messages inserted into every show by
           creator Matt Groening.
     Troy: Over the six years "The Simpsons" has been on the air, we've
           received dozens of letters from fans wanting to know more
           about the show.  Tonight, we'll answer some of your
           questions.
           Professor Lawrence Pierce of the University of Chicago
           writes, "I think Homer gets stupider every year."  That's not
           a question, Professor, but we'll let the viewers judge for
           themselves.

Troy: Dr. Linus Irving of the Sloan-Ketterling Memorial Institute
      writes, "How does Matt Groening find the time to write and draw an
      entire `Simpsons' episode every week?"  For the answer to this, we
      went straight to the source.
       [through a window, a shot of Matt at a desk]
Matt: [seeing the camera] Get out of my off --!
       [picks up a gun, shoots at the camera]
Troy: Of course, what Matt _meant_ to say, according to his attorneys,
      is that he couldn't possibly do it alone.  And he insisted that we
      make time to acknowledge the hard work of everyone who makes "The
      Simpsons" possible.
       [very quick shot of lots of names]
-- Hey, they took the time, 

    Troy: Ambassador Henry Mwabwetumba of the Ivory Coast writes, "What
          is the real deal with Mr. Burns' assistant Smithers?  You know
          what I'm talking about."  Ha ha ha, of course we do.

Smithers: People _like_ dogs, Mr. Burns.
   Burns: Nonsense!  Dogs are idiots.  Think about it, Smithers: if _I_
          came into your house and started sniffing at your crotch and
          slobbering all over your face, what would you say?

   Burns: [halting cadence] Hello, Smithers.  You're quite good at
          turning me on.
Smithers: Um...you probably should ignore that.
           [0:19 from 9F05 ("Marge Gets a Job")]
   Burns: [sighs] I dreamed about her again last night, Smithers.  You
          know that dream when you're in bed and they fly in through the
          window?
           [Smithers imagines Burns doing just that]
    Troy: [voiceover] As you can see, the real deal with Waylon Smithers
          is that he's Mr. Burns' assistant.  He's in his early 40s, is
          unmarried, and currently resides in Springfield.  Thanks for
          writing!  We'll be right back.
-- "Skirting" the issue, 

Just before the commercial break, the announcer asks, "Which popular
`Simpsons' characters have died in the past year?"

[End of Act Two.  Time: 13:22]

Announcer: Which popular "Simpsons" characters have died in the past
           year?  If you said Bleeding Gums Murphy and Dr. Marvin
           Monroe, you are wrong: they were never popular.
     Troy: Right about now, you're probably saying, "Troy, I've seen
           _every_ `Simpsons' episode.  You can't show me anything new."
            [menacing] Well, you got some attitude, Mister.
           Besides, you're wrong!  Because sometimes, episodes run long,
           and certain scenes never get aired.  So fire up your VCR,
           because here, for the first time ever, are the cut-out
           classics.

  Troy: [voiceover] When Krusty the clown got canceled, he tried
        everything to stay on the air.  Here's what you didn't see.
Krusty: Watch my show, I will send you this book featuring me in a
        variety of sexually explicit positions.
         [men drag him off] What?  Hey!  It's not really me: I used a
        stunt butt!
         [later, Krusty looks dejected as three men walk up]
 Man 1: Krusty, we're from the network.  Uh, we have some bad news: I'm
        afraid your show's been canceled.
Krusty: Oh, I thought this would happen.  I just hope you replace me
        with something as educational and uplifting as I tried to be.
 Man 2: Actually, it's a hemorrhoid infomercial starring Claude Akins.
Krusty: Can I play hemorrhoid sufferer number one?  Ooh!  Oh, that
        hurts!  Ow!  Oh, is there no relief?
 Man 1: I don't think so.  [they start to walk off]
Krusty: How about one of the "after" guys?  Aah.  Ohh, that's better.  I
        can ride a bike again!
 Man 1: Sorry.

         blackjack dealer -- and comedy was in the cards.
Blofeld: 20.  Your move, Mr. Bond.
   Bond: I'll take a hit, dealer.  [Homer gives him a card]
         Joker!  You were supposed to take those out of the deck.
  Homer: Oh, sorry.  Here's another one.
   Bond: What's this card?  "Rules for Draw and Stud Poker"?
Blofeld: What a pity, Mr. Bond.

 Homer: Mmm.
Mother: Homer, please: you don't have to wolf down that 25- year-old

Mother: Well, sure.  I read all about it.  It _was_ national news.

 Homer: No, I work at the nuclear power plant.
Mother: Oh, Homer.

Troy has fallen asleep on the couch behind the film projector.  Someone
pokes him with a stick.  "If that's what they cut out, what they leave
in must be pure gold!" he says, awakening with a start.  "Let's watch
some more of those fabulous Simpsons outtakes."

 Troy: Apu living with the Simpsons?!  It happened.  And here's a scene
       you didn't see.
  Apu: I'm hoping you enjoy this movie.  It made every Indian critic's

          with his estranged son.  Watch.
   Homer: Bart, you're coming home.
    Bart: I want to stay here with Mr. Burns.
   Burns: I suggest you leave immediately.
   Homer: Or what?  You'll release the dogs, or the bees, or the dogs
          with bees in their mouths, and when they bark, they shoot bees
          at you?  Well, go ahead.  Do your worst.
   Burns: "Do my worst", eh?  Smithers, release the robotic Richard
          Simmons.

The camera returns to Troy.

Troy: This past summer, all of America was trying to solve the mystery
      of who shot Mr. Burns.  [pause] Then they found out it was the
      baby.
       [long pause; coughs]
      To keep this bombshell secret, the producers animated several
      solutions that were never intended to air.
       [scene shows Barney, Tito Puente, Moe, Apu, and SLH each shooting
      Mr. Burns next to the Simpson car]
      And to keep the show's animators, editors, staff, and hangers-on
      from leaking the solution, two completely different endings were
      produced: one real, one phony.  Here's the ending you were never
      meant to see.
-- The rumors laid to rest, 

   Burns: The one who shot me was...[camera pans to Smithers]
          Aah!  Aah!  Waylon Smithers!
Smithers: [pained] Noo!  Wait a minute: yes.
   Burns: With the sun blocker in place and the town aghast, I was on
          top of the world.  So I wanted to kick up my heels and indulge
          my sweet tooth.
           [walks toward parking lot]
          I feel like celebrating.  [sees Maggie] Oh, it's you.  What
          are you so happy about?
           [she smiles, holding up a lollipop]
           [gasps] I see.
           [voiceover] Smithers had thwarted my earlier attempt to take
          candy from a baby.  But with him out of the picture, I was
          free to wallow in my own crapulence.  Or so I thought -- but
          at the last moment, Smithers, drunk as a lemur, lurched out of
          the darkness and fired.
Smithers: [remembering] That's right.  Right before I shot Jasper.  Hmm,
          I was busy that night.
   Burns: [voiceover] Stricken, I lurched forth in search of aid, but
          finding only slack-jawed gawkers, I gave up and collapsed on
          the sundial.
    Lisa: Then, with your last ounce of strength, you pointed to W and
          S: "Waylon Smithers".
   Marge: Well, I'm just relieved that Homer's safe and that you've
          recovered and that we can all get back to normal.
   Burns: Not exactly.  Smithers, for attempting to kill me, I'm giving
          you a 5% pay cut.
Smithers: [howling] Ohh.
    Troy: But of course, for that ending to work, you would have to
          ignore all the Simpson DNA evidence.  [laughs] And that would
          be downright nutty.
-- The alternate ending to 2F20 ("Who Shot Mr. Burns?  Part Two"), "The

The camera shows two photos of the Simpson family, one from an early
Tracy Ullman short, the other from a modern episode.

Troy: Yes, the Simpsons have come a long way since an old drunk made
      humans out of his rabbit characters to pay off his gambling debts.
      Who knows what adventures they'll have between now and the time
      the show becomes unprofitable?

EPISODE SUMMARY: 
On the TV...

Announcer: It's a Krusty Kinda Khristmas, brought to you by ILG: selling
           your body's chemicals after you die.  And by Li'l Sweetheart
           Cupcakes -- a subsidiary of ILG.
   Krusty: [walking in with a turkey] Oh, hi!  I didn't hear you come
           in.  Welcome to my home.
            [outside the "window", Kent Brockman prepares for a
           newscast]
           Ho, ho.  [closing the blind] Say, did I hear some carolers?
            [walks over to door, opens it]
 Carolers: Come, they told me...
   Krusty: Hey!  It's respected private citizen Tom Landry!  And South
           American sensation Xoxchisha -- Xoxchoshe -- Xox -- oh, boy.
            [walks away]
Announcer: Now, stay tuned for a video Christmas card from Tupac Shapur.
-- We wish you a gangsta Christmas, 

Lisa and Bart are watching the show.

 Lisa: Hey, I thought Krusty was Jewish.
 Bart: Christmas is a time when people of _all_ religions come together
       to worship Jesus Christ.

 Bart: [drooling] Oh, yeah.
Santa: So tell your folks, "Buy me Bonestorm or go to Hell!"
-- The power of advertising, 

Marge and Homer are in the kitchen when Bart walks in.

 Bart: Buy me Bonestorm or go to Hell!
Marge: Bart!
Homer: Young man, in this house, we use a little word called "please".
 Bart: It's the coolest video game ever!
Marge: I'm sorry, honey, but those games cost up to and including $70.
       And they're violent, and they distract you from your schoolwork.
 Bart: Those are all good points, but the problem is they don't result
       in me getting the game.
Homer: I know how you feel, Bart.  When I was your age, I wanted an
       electric football game more than anything in the world.  And my
       parents bought it for me, and it was the happiest day of my life.
       [pause] Well, good night.  [walks out]
-- Homer inadvertently forgets the point, 

Bart lies on top of his bed that night, dejected.

 Bart: Ohh, I'll never get that game.
Marge: [walking in] Tuck-in time!
        [singing] All aboard the sleepy train
       To visit Mother Goose.
       Barty's stop is Snoozyland
       To rest his sweet caboose.
 Bart: Mom, I'm not a little kid any more!  Tuck-in time is lame.
Marge: Well, if loving my kids is lame, then I guess I'm just a big
       lame.
 Bart: Mom, it's lame to be proud of being lame.
Marge: Well, life is like a box of chocolates --
 Bart: Mom -- no!  Mom --
Marge: You never know --

Bart walks unhappily down the street the next day.  His spirits brighten
when he spots an ad in a store window for Bonestorm for 99 cents.

     Bart: [dumps money on counter] I want to buy a copy of Bonestorm.
           Here's 99 cents.
Comic guy: [sighs] Allow me to summarize the proposed transaction: you
           wish to purchase Bonestorm for 99 cents.  Net profit to me,
           negative $59.
            [opens cash register] Oh, oh please, take my $59.  I don't
           want it.  It's yours.
            [Bart reaches as if to do so]
           Eh, eh, eh -- it seems we are unfamiliar with sarcasm.  I
           shall close the register at this point [does so] and state
           that 99 cents is the rental price.
     Bart: Oh, then may I please rent it?  Please?
Comic guy: No you may not.  I am all out.  Though I do have a surprising
           abundance of Lee Carvallo's Putting Challenge.
     Bart: [moaning] Ohh...
-- With Goro as your caddy, 

Bart walks back down the street, still dejected.  Passing one house, he
sees lights flashing brightly inside and hears the sound of lightning.

    Bart: Milhouse has Bonestorm!
           [inside, Milhouse's hair is being blown back from the TV]
Milhouse: This is great...and all I've done is enter my name!
          "Thrillhouse".
           [screen shows "WELCOME THRILLHO"]
    Bart: [walking in] Say, cool dude, can I play too?
Milhouse: [scrambling] Uh, uh, it's only a one player game.
    Bart: Then how come it says "Second player score"?
Milhouse: [pause] Mom!  Bart's swearing!
-- Sure-fire ejection techniques, 

Mrs. Van Houten ignores Bart's protestations as she kicks him out of the
house.  Bart goes to the Try-N-Save and stands outside the entrance.

 Bart: Hmm.  Maybe if I stand next to the games looking sad, someone
       will feel sorry for me and buy me one.
        [goes inside, puts hand through hole in display case window and
       holds a copy of Bonestorm]
        [his arm gets crushed by an employee opening the case]
Woman: Gavin, don't you already have this game?
Gavin: No, Mom, you idiot!  I have Bloodstorm, and Bone Squad, and
       Bloodstorm II, stupid.
Woman: Oh, I'm sorry, honey.  We'll take a Bonestorm.
Gavin: Get two.  I'm not sharing with Kaitlin!
        [employee does so]
 Bart: [dreamy] That must be the happiest kid in the world.
-- Bart's keen eye for detail, 

Jimbo and Nelson walk up to Bart.

 Jimbo: Psst.  Hey, Simpson: check this out.
         [lifts hat to reveal football concealed underneath]
Nelson: Look what I got!
         [pulls back jean vest to reveal a new one underneath]
        It's the kind I like.
  Bart: Are you guys shoplifting?
 Jimbo: Four-finger discount, dude.
Nelson: Shoplifting is a victimless crime, like punching someone in the
        dark.
         [they walk off laughing]
-- Yeah, the only victim is Moe, 

Bart sees that the video game display case has been left open.  He eyes
Bonestorm and looks worried.  Several video game characters cajole him.

       Luigi: Go ahead-a, Bart, take-a the Bonestorm.
       Mario: The store, she's so rich.  She'll-a never notice.
 Donkey Kong: Duh, it's the company's fault for making you want it so
              much.
Lee Carvallo: Don't do it, son.  How's that game going to help your
              putting?
       Sonic: Just take it!  Take it, take it, take it, take it, take
              it.  Take it!
-- The voices of video game conscience, 

Bart cannot resist: he takes a copy, puts it in his coat, zips it up,
and walks out.

  Bart: I'm outside.  I got away with it.  I'm free!
         [a hand falls on his shoulder]
Brodka: Son, would you open your coat, please?
  Bart: Uh...I don't think this is the kind of coat that opens.
Brodka: Please step back in the store, Son.
 Woman: That boy's parents must have made some terrible mistakes.
 Gavin: Shut up, Mom.
-- 

[End of Act One.  Time: 6:13]

Bart gets walked toward the back of the store.  He passes a Santa Claus
who tries to hand him a candy cane, but the store detective says "No,
no, not for him," walking on by.  "Oh," frowns Santa, "I see."  The two
walk back to where the mannequins are stored and up to the detective's
office.  Eventually, the detective puts a videotape in the VCR and
starts it.  The screen shows "Shoplifters Beware."

Troy: Hi, I'm Troy McClure.  You might remember me from such public
      service videos as "Designated Drivers: The Lifesaving Nerds" and
      "Phony Tornado Alarms Reduce Readiness".  I'm here today to give
      you the skinny on shoplifting, thereby completing my plea bargain
      with the good people at "Foot Locker" of Beverly Hills.
       [scene switch] Shoplifting began here, in ancient Phonecia.
      Thieves would literally lift the corner of a shop in order to
      snatch the sweet, sweet olives within.  [a man does so]
      Oh, Shakazaramesh, will you ever learn?  Flash forward to ancient
      Babylonia --
-- Troy McClure, public service guy, 

Brodka: [pounding the TV off] All right, show's over.
  Bart: Er, excuse me?
Brodka: You think you're pretty smart, don't you?
  Bart: No.
Brodka: Don't smart off to me, smart guy!
  Bart: [stammering] I could pay for the game.  I'll pay for it!
Brodka: You know, that kind of mush might fly at Lamps Plus, but don't
        peddle it here.
         [Bart laughs nervously]
Brodka: That's it, Mr. Comedian.  I'm calling your parents!
-- Bart, misunderstood, 

Brodka dials the phone while Bart looks unhappy.

Brodka: Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Simpson?  This is detective Don Brodka from
        Try-N-Save security.  That's right, Don Brodka.  Your son Bart
        has been caught shoplifting.  Uh huh.  Yeah, it's a shame, I
        know, but...well, _try_ and have a merry Christmas.
         [hangs up] They weren't home, uh huh.  But I left a message on
        their answering machine, that's right.
  Bart: Um, OK.  I've really, really, _really_ learned my lesson.  Can I
        please go now?
Brodka: Yeah, get out of my sight.
         [Bart starts to run away]
        Hey, kid: one more thing.  If you _ever_ set foot in this store
        again, you'll be spending Christmas in juvenile hall.  Capisce?
         [Bart looks blank]
        Well, do you understand?
  Bart: Everything except "capisce".
-- He's weak in the romance languages, 

Brodka tries eating some of those crackers 'n' cheez things, but the
cracker breaks as he tries to spread the cheez on it and he curses.

Bart rides home in a panic, intent on changing the answering machine
tape.  Homer, Marge, and Maggie drive by, with Homer just as intent on
changing Maggie once they arrive home.  Espying his parents, Bart takes
a short cut.

  Homer: [pushing "Play"] Hmm, we didn't have a message when we left.
         How very odd.
Machine: [singing] Hello, Muddah, hello, Faddah.  Here I am at Camp
         Granada.
  Homer: Marge, is Lisa at Camp Granada?
   Bart: [chuckles, holding real answering machine tape] Now to put this
         tape where no one will ever listen to it.
          [puts it in an Allan Sherman case]
-- No Sherman fans in Springfield, 

In the kitchen, Marge opens the refrigerator.

Marge: Homer, didn't you get any milk?  All I see is egg nog.
Homer: 'Tis the season, Marge!  We only get thirty sweet noggy days.
       Then the government takes it away again.  [pours some on his
       cereal]
 Lisa: [chokes on her cereal] I think I'm having chest pains.
        [Bart walks in, whistling]
Marge: Bart, get your suit on.
 Bart: What for?
Marge: We're getting our Christmas picture taken.
 Bart: Ehh, you lucked out, Marge, my man, 'cause I'm in a smiling mood
       today.
Marge: [laughs] Well, good!  So get ready, and before you know it, we'll
       be at the Try-N-Save.
 Bart: [pauses] Try-N-Save?
        [steam appears to blow from his ears]
Marge: Ah, my teapots are ready.
-- When smiles turn to frowns, 

As Bart ties his tie, he looks in the mirror and remembers Brodka's
warning: "If you ever set foot in this store again, you'll be spending
Christmas in juvenile hall...juvenile hall...juvenile hall..." Bart
imagines what it will be like.  In his dream, Kearney, Dolph, Nelson,
and Jimbo are in a barracks-style room with him.

 Guard: Stand behind the yellow line!  You will now receive your
        Christmas presents donated by the Port Authority lost and found
        office.
         [the bullies move forward one at a time to a laundry slot]
        Pass your chit to Santa to receive your gift.  If you do not
        have a chit, you will not receive a gift.
 Jimbo: Wow!  The March 8th newspaper.
Nelson: Cool!  A book of carpet samples.
  Bart: [crosses fingers] Come on, new bike!
         [drops chit in slot]
         [groans] Ohh, a soiled wig.
 Santa: [through a speaker] Merry Christmas and a happy new year.
-- Bart's juvenile hall fantasy, 

Bart gulps as he returns to reality.

Marge: [calling out] Bart, what's taking so long?  If you're having that
       problem with your zipper, I can send your father up.
Homer: Oh, no I'm not.
        [Bart runs downstairs]
Marge: What's the matter with your face?  Is that a fake nose?  Are you
       wearing chin putty?
 Bart: I don't have to listen to these wild allegations!
        [knocks his nose off by accident; SLH eats it]
Marge: Please, Bart, no more pranks.  It would mean so much to me if we
       could have just one nice family photo.
        [shot of family photo with crosseyed Bart]
        [shot of family photo with Bart wearing a mustache]
        [shot of family photo with Bart holding an "I stink!" speech
       balloon next to Homer]
Homer: Hey, I don't remember saying that!
-- Homer, unclear on the concept, 

On the way there, Bart sits in the back seat looking nervous.

 Marge: Uh oh, almost forgot to lock the doors.
         [the locks slam down like a jail cell door closing]
  Bart: [groaning] Ohh...
         [the seat back turns into Brodka]
Brodka: I hope you're going to the Valley Vista Try-N-Save, kid, 'cause
        you don't want to come to my store.  Catfische?
         [seat-back Brodka puts his cigarette out in the ashtray]
-- At least Bart's fantasies are sanitary, 

Homer pulls into a parking space at the Try-N-Save.  Bart lags a little
behind the rest of the family as they walk in.

 Bart: [smiling nervously] So we're just going to do this photo and get
       out, right?  Budda bing, budda boom.
 Lisa: I want to look at the pets, and write things on the typewriters,
       and see if the new dictionaries are in!
Marge: OK.
Homer: I want to price some flip flops, and smell the new tires, and
       consult the pharmacist for some free medical advice!
Marge: Sure!  We're going to have a great day.  Budda bing, budda boom,
       right, Bart?  Bart?  What's wrong, honey?
        [Bart stands far back, looking around]
Homer: Uh oh...somebody's got tired little legs!
        [grabs Bart, puts him on his shoulders]
-- Approaching the doors of death, 

As they enter, Bart sees a security camera swiveling around and he tries
to avoid it as Homer looks around.  "Hmm," asks Homer, "I wonder where
the flip flops are?  Men's wear?  Maybe in sporting goods.  Wait!  No,
sleep wear.  Oh -- probably better living."  He puts Bart down in a
chair, away from the eye of the camera, and Bart sighs with relief --
only to run away nervously as alarms go off and arrows flash at the
chair: "Folding chair riot!  $9.99!"

Marge looks dreamily at a jeweled watch in a display case.

Marge: Oh, Homey, look at that watch.  I've always wanted a watch like
       that.
Homer: [sly] Well, maybe someone will give you one for Christmas.
Marge: Mmm.
Homer: [thinking] Now she'll _really_ be surprised when she opens that
       ironing board cover!
-- The spirit of giving, 

The family go to the portrait studio section of the store.  Homer spies
a Time magazine with Ned Flanders on the cover and a caption "Man of the
Century".  Homer scoffs, "Must have been a pretty slow century."  The
photographer adjusts the angle of Lisa's hat, then has everyone sit on a
decorative old-fashioned love seat.

  Bart: [looking into the distance] [gasps] The store detective!
         [to photographer] Hey, Ansel Adams, let's go.  Take the photo!
 Marge: Oh, wait!  Wait, I don't want Maggie's face hidden behind that
        pacifier.
         [she takes it out; Maggie starts to cry]
Photog: Don't worry, momma: I can put a smile on baby's face.  [grabs a
        balloon] OK, sugarplum, it's time to meet Mr. Funny Voice.
         [breathes from the balloon] Hello, I -- oh, it's just air.
-- So much for _that_ impression, 

The store detective walks down a closer aisle and Bart says, "Come on,
hurry up!"  The photographer counts to three, then takes the photo just
as Bart is being snatched away by the collar.

Brodka: I thought I told you, don't return for busted merchandise!
 Homer: What are you doing to my son?
Brodka: I'm afraid your son broke the eleventh commandment: Thou shalt
        not steal.
 Marge: That's crazy.  Bart's not a shoplifter: he's just a little boy.
Brodka: Oh, sure, _now_ he's just a little boy stealing little toys.
        But some day, he'll be a grown man stealing stadiums and -- and
        quarries.
 Marge: My son may not be perfect, but I know in my heart he's not a
        shoplifter.
         [Brodka puts in the videotape and starts playing it]
 Marge: Fine, play the tape.  Then everyone can see you've got the wrong
        boy.
         [surveillance camera shows Bart standing in front of video
        games]
  Bart: [blocking the TV] Wait!  Mom, I don't want you to see this.
         [behind him, the tape plays on the wall of TVs for sale]
        I did it.
         [the camera repeatedly shows him stealing the game; the crowd
        murmurs]
 Marge: Oh, Bart.
-- Caught in the act, 

[End of Act Two.  Time: 13:58]

Homer chastises Bart at home.

Homer: How _could_ you?!  Haven't you learned anything from that guy who
       gives those sermons at church?  Captain Whatshisname?  We live in
       a society of laws.  Why do you think I took you to all those
       "Police Academy" movies?  For fun?  Well, I didn't hear anybody
       laughing!  Did you?!  Except at that guy who made sound effects.
        [Homer makes some and laughs to himself]
       Where was I?  Oh yeah: stay out of my booze.
 Bart: [pained] Mom, I'm _really_ sorry.
Marge: [emotionless] I know you are.
 Bart: Is there anything I can do?
Marge: I don't know.  [pause] Why don't you go to bed?
 Bart: [hesitant] OK...
-- The real punishment begins, 

Marge looks at the photo unhappily, then hangs it above the stockings
and fireplace.  It slides askance, and she sighs.  Upstairs, Bart and
Lisa brush their teeth.

Bart: Man, I thought Mom was going to scream me stupid.  She didn't even
      raise her voice.
Lisa: I admit I haven't known Mom as long as you have, but I know when
      she's really upset.  Her heart won't just wipe clean like this
      bathroom countertop: it absorbs everything that touches it, like
      this bathroom rug.
Bart: [looks at rug] Really?  You think _this_ might be one of those
      forever-type things?
Lisa: [with her mouth full] I don't know.
-- The bathroom: the metaphor for life, 

Bart walks gingerly out over the filthy rug and climbs into bed.  He
hears Marge singing in Lisa's room.

Marge: [in Lisa's room] Lisa's on a Sleepy Train
       To rest her weary head.
       Her ticket is a candy cane
       Made out of gingerbread.
 Lisa: [giggles] Good night, Mom.
Marge: Good night, sweetheart.  [footsteps]
 Bart: Oh, great.  The Tuck-In Express is right on time.
Marge: [standing in doorway] Good night.  [shuts door]
-- The Tuck-In TGV, more like it, 

Homer sits up in bed with his half-moon glasses on as Marge exits the
bathroom to join him.

Homer: I've figured out the boy's punishment.  First, he's grounded.  No
       leaving the house, not even for school.  Second, no egg nog.  In
       fact, no nog, period.  And third, absolutely no stealing for
       three months.
Marge: I always thought I understood my special little guy, but
       somewhere along the road, his hand slipped away from mine.
        [looks at a handprint of "Bart, age 4"]
Homer: Ehh, what are you going to do?
Marge: [pause] Mmm.  He's not my little baby any more.  Maybe I mother
       him too much.
-- The coming of age, 

She turns out the light.  That night, it snows, and the next morning,
the world is white.  Bart walks downstairs and into the kitchen yawning;
the rest of the family is already eating.

 Bart: [hurt] Hey, Mom, you didn't wake me up.
Marge: Here's your hot chocolate.
 Bart: [looking at other cups] You didn't put my marshmallow in.
Marge: I think you're old enough to do it yourself now.
 Bart: OK, I can handle that.
        [puts a marshmallow in; it absorbs all the hot chocolate]
        [Bart dumps it out on a plate and uses a knife and fork on it]
  Abe: Hey!  Give me a slice.
-- A bold new flavor sensation, 

Bart goes over to discuss the situation with Milhouse.

    Bart: Milhouse...do you ever worry that your mom might stop loving
          you?
Milhouse: What?  I'm more worried about pirhanas.  Did you see that
          movie where they send a nuclear submarine to fight the
          pirhanas, and one of them swims right down the periscope and
          bites the guy in the eye, and he goes, "Aah!  Aah!  Aah!", and
          that old lady told him it would happen?
    Bart: [unenthusiastic] Yeah, that was pretty good.  Hey, how come
          you're not playing Bonestorm?
Milhouse: Ehh, it got boring.  I'm really into this cup and ball now.
           [starts playing with it] Whoa!  Wow!  [laughs] Man, you never
          know which way this crazy ball's going to go!  [laughs]
    Bart: Yeah, right.  You're just trying to trick me because you don't
          want me playing with your video game.
Milhouse: Here, go ahead.  [gives him the cartridge]
    Bart: No.  Let me try the cup and ball.
Milhouse: [indignant] Get your own!
    Bart: Come on, don't be a cup and ball hog!
Milhouse: Hey!  Give it.  That's mine!
           [they struggle for it, yelling at each other]
          Mom!  Bart's smoking!
-- Indoors, no less (worse than Hitler), 

Mrs. Van Houten pushes Bart down the stairs and towards the door.

   Bart: OK!  I won't bug Milhouse.  But...well...Mrs. Van Houten, this
         is going to sound kind of dumb, but...can I hang out with you
         while you do mom stuff?
          [Mrs. VH smiles]
          [in the kitchen, she puts Christmas cards in envelopes; Bart
         helps her by putting the stamps on]
   Bart: Who are Dan and Sherrie Adler?
Mrs. VH: Just friends of ours.
   Bart: Oh.  And, who is Warren Burke?
Mrs. VH: Oh.  He used to tune our piano before we got rid of it.  He
         grew up in Mechanicsburg.
   Bart: [genuinely interested] Oh, really?
Mrs. VH: Mmm.  [realizes, looks quizzically at Bart]
   Bart: [pause] Tell me I'm good.
-- Can't get enough of that wonderful mom stuff, 

Bart walks home to hear the sound of laughter from Marge.

 Bart: Oh, hey!  That's Mom.  She's happy again!
        [runs to the yard]
        [perturbed] You guys made a snowman family?
Homer: Check it out, boy: it's like looking into a living snow mirror.
        [snow Homer has hair and large muscles]
 Bart: Why didn't you wait for me?
Marge: I didn't think you'd mind.  I figured you were getting a little
       too old for this.  But you can still make one: there's some snow
       left under the car.
        [said snow is all dirty and disgusting]
-- Thanks a lot, Mom, 

Bart reaches under the car and scoops out some of the dirty snow.  He
fashions a grey, ugly version of himself with twigs for arms and puts it
next to the rest of the snow Simpsons.  Inside, he sees the rest of his
family watching TV.  A bird lands on the corner of snow Bart and flies
off as it crumbles.

  Bart: [muttering] Stupid family.
Nelson: Hey, Simpson, look what I swiped from Try-N-Save: it's a
        replacement tire for a wheelbarrow.
  Bart: Huh?
Nelson: I knew _you'd_ like it.  [laughs, walks off]
-- Irony, not lost on Nelson, 

Bart rues, "Everyone thinks I'm the black sheep.  Well, I'll show 'em
what a black sheep can do!"  He shakes his fist at the clouds and walks
into the Try-N-Save.

 Lisa: [spraying the Christmas tree] Mom, this fake snow is making me
       dizzy.
Marge: We're almost finished.  There's just a little bit of green left.
        [Lisa drops the can and looks catatonic]
        [Bart walks in]
Marge: There you are.  You can help me spray the cookies!
        [Bart looks at her] Are you hiding something?  What do you have
       under your jacket?
 Bart: Nothing!
Marge: Oh, Bart, not again.  Give it to me!
 Bart: I told you, I don't have anything!  [runs off]
Marge: You can't hide from me in this house, Bart.  I spend 23 hours a
       day here.
Homer: [blocking a door] Hee hee hee.  Get 'im, Ma.
-- Homer, country bumpkin, 

Marge: There's no place left to run, Bart.  Hand it over.
        [he gives her a picture in a frame]
       Oh, Bart: I can't believe you did this.
        [the picture is Bart smiling; a receipt says "Paid in full"]
 Bart: I wanted to surprise you for Christmas.
Marge: Oh, sweetie, this is the best present a mother could get.
        [showers Bart with kisses] I love you so much, my little bitty
       Barty.
 Bart: [bashful] Mom...
-- All's well, 

Marge puts the new picture atop the old picture, blocking out Bart in
the old picture.

Marge: Since I got my present early, I think you should get yours early
       too!
 Lisa: Bart got a present early?  Then I should get a present early!  I
       want a present.
Marge: Lisa, you have to wait.
 Lisa: [mutters] This is the worst Christmas ever.
Marge: Now I know you love video games, and I asked the clerk which is
       the one every boy wants --
 Bart: [opening it] [gasps] You got me --
        ["Lee Carvallo's Putting Challenge"]
        [Bart sees Marge is smiling]
        [with forced enthusiasm] Oh, yeah!  Thanks, Mom.
-- Bart, accomplished actor, 

[End of Act Three.  Time: 21:10]

The background of the closing credits is a demonstration of Lee
Carvallo's Putting Challenge.  The game talks.

Lee: Welcome to Lee Carvallo's Putting Challenge.  I am Carvallo.  Now,
     choose a club.  ["beep"]
     You have chosen a three wood.  May I suggest a putter?  ["beep"]
     Three wood.  Now enter the force of your swing.  I suggest feather

 EPISODE TITLE: Team Homer


EPISODE SUMMARY: 
[Syndication cuts are marked in curly braces "{}" and are courtesy of
Frederic Briere.]

Bart and Milhouse hang out in the comic store, looking at the new wares.

    Bart: My God: the Mad Magazine Special Edition!  They only put out
          seventeen of these a year!  [grabs it]
Milhouse: Boy, they're really socking it to that Spiro Agnew guy.  He
          must work there or something.
    Bart: Let's do the Fold-In.
Milhouse: OK.
           [the Fold-In will clearly become a green dollar sign]
           [reading] "What higher power do TV evangelists worship?"
    Bart: I'll say God.
Milhouse: I'll say Jesus.
           [they fold it in]
    Both: "The Almighty Dollar"?!
   Owner: You fold it, you bought it.
-- The penalty for defacing the Mad Fold-In, 

At home, Homer delights in reading the magazine himself.

Homer: Ooh, "Snappy Answers to Stupid Questions"!  I'm great at these.
       Ask me if something smells funny in here, Boy.
 Bart: Does something smell funny in here?
Homer: I don't think so...stupid!  [laughs to self]
Marge: [walking in] Homey, you want pork chops?
Homer: No, I want roast beef, you clod!  [laughs some more]
 Bart: Look at this: "Special Insert: Iron-On Mad-Ness!"
        [reads iron-ons] "Ban the Bath"..."Don't Trust Anyone Over
       Ten"..."Sock It To Me!"  [laughs to self]
Marge: Hmm.  Those magazines create a dangerous amount of laughter.
Homer: [trying to do Fold-In] "The Al-ighty -ollar?"  [laughs] Oh, I get
       it!
-- The bastion of magazine humor, 

Later, at Moe's, Homer is the only customer.

   Moe: Gee, business stinks tonight.  Where's Barney, Lenny, and Carl?
 Homer: Aw, they never come around any more now that they've got their
        _mistresses_.
   Moe: [sighs] Might as well close the dump.
         [outside, Quimby leads a bunch of people toward the bar]
Quimby: I am going to drink you under the table.
   Man: No, I am going to drink _you_ under the --
         [the "Moe's" lighted sign turns off]
         [the crowd sighs and turns back]
 Homer: [yawns] Well, you're closing, it's getting late, my kids are
        probably wondering where their dad is...
         [grabs Moe, implores] There's got to be some other place we can
        go.  Thank, Moe, think!
-- Staying away from the loving wife and children, 

The other place is the bowling alley.  Homer and Moe ask the kid on duty
if they can get a lane.

  Kid: Sorry, it's league night.  I couldn't give a lane to my own
       mother.
Doris: [walking by] I have no son.  [walks off]
-- Even if she disowns me, 

  Moe: Man!  You go through life, you try to be nice to people, you
       struggle to resist the urge to punch in the face, and for what?
       For some pimply little _puke_ to treat like dirt unless you're on
       a _team_.  Well, I'm better than dirt -- well, most kinds of
       dirt.  I mean, not that fancy store-bought dirt.  That stuff's
       loaded with nutrients.  I -- I can't compete with that stuff.
  Apu: That I cannot bowl wreaks havoc with my self-esteem as well, but
       who am I to complain?
Homer: Well, I'm tired of being a wannabe league bowler.  I wanna be a
       league bowler!
-- The grand aspiration, 

A lightbulb turns on over Homer's head.

Homer: Hey!  We could be a team...
        [at the counter] Excuse me, but my _team_ is ready to bowl.
  Kid: You're short one person.
Homer: [seeing Otto] Uh, that longhaired freak's bowled with us for
       years.
 Otto: [at a prize machine] Ooh, I don't care if it takes me all night:
       I'm going to get me that lobster harmonica.  Come on, lobstey --!
        [it drops of the claws]
  Kid: OK.  Then I just need your $500 registration fee.
Homer: $500?!  [quickly subdued] Oh, no problem.  Will you take an out-
       of-state two party bad check?
-- Not on his mother's grave, 

Getting a negative answer from the kid, Homer turns to the obvious place
for the registration fee.

Marge: No, I will _not_ pay you $500 for sex!
Homer: Aw, come on, Marge!  You're getting something in return, and I'm
       getting a bowling team.  It's win-win!
Marge: It's sick!  And I don't have that kind of money to spend on sex.
       Maybe you could get someone with money to sponsor your team.
Homer: [scoffs] Burns never gives money to anybody.  Just last week I
       asked him for $1,500.
Marge: For what?
Homer: Oh, I gotta get the third degree from you too?
-- Beset on all sides, 

In class, Mrs. Krabappel starts to tell the class about their homework
assignment.

    Edna: Tonight's homework assignment is --
    Bart: [exaggerated] Oh, man: is it hot in here.  I'd better take off
          my sweater.
    Edna: [reading his T-shirt] "Down...with...[gasps] homework"?!
           [the class starts laughing]
          Don't look at it, children.  [she stands in front of him]
Milhouse: His shirt makes a good point.
  Nelson: I'm with the shirt: homework rots.
Everyone: Down with homework!  Down with homework!
           [they throw their books out the windows]
           [some kids try to suffocate Edna with chalk dust]

-- How riots are born, 

Superindendent Chalmers walks down a hall with Skinner.

 Skinner: As I was saying, my yearly evaluation couldn't have come at a
          better time.
Chalmers: Well, Seymour, I must say for once, I am impressed.  In fact,
          I am going to give this school a perfect ten.
           [lifts clipboard] I'll just write the zero first...now, a
          vertical line to indicate the one --
Everyone: [running out] Down with homework!
           [Chalmers gets trampled to the ground]
Chalmers: Skinner!  Why are children walking on my head?
           [Skinner fishes Bart out of the stampede]
-- The answer: this ten-year-old, 

Skinner takes Bart into his office.

Skinner: So: we meet again, Mad Magazine.
   Bart: How do you know it's from Mad?
Skinner: [walking to his window] The year was 1968.  We were on recon in
         a steaming Mekong delta.  An overheated private removed his
         flak jacket, revealing a T-shirt with an iron-on sporting the
         Mad slogan "Up With Mini-Skirts".
         Well, we all had a good laugh, even though I didn't quite
         understand it.  But our momentary lapse of concentration
         allowed Charlie to get the drop on us.
         I spent the next three years in a POW camp, forced to subsist
         on a thin stew of fish, vegetables, prawns, coconut milk, and
         four kinds of rice.  I came close to madness trying to find it
         here in the States, but they just can't get the spices right --
   Bart: Uh, my punishment?
Skinner: Hmm?  Oh, I'm going to have to think about that.  Meanwhile,
         wear this home.
          [puts a seat pillow over Bart's torso and zips it up]
-- The gourmet prison camps of the east, 

Smithers gives Mr. Burns a manicure in his office.

   Burns: [groaning] Ohh!  I need some more ether.  I can still feel the
          movement of the emory board.
Smithers: [checks bottle] We're fresh out, Sir.  I'll get some more.
   Burns: Leave the rag.
           [sniffs it] Mmm...
           [Smithers walks out; Homer sneaks in]
   Homer: Uh...excuse me, Mr. Burns?
   Burns: [gasps] Poppin' Fresh!  You glutinous little doughboy.
           [Homer morphs into Poppin' Fresh in Burns' mind]
           [chuckles] There's something I've wanted to do to you for
          years!
           [starts poking his stomach; Homer laughs]
   Homer: [getting his eyes poked at] Ow!  Heh, Mr. Burns?  I, er, was
          wondering if you'd like to sponsor my bowling team...for...
          $500.
   Burns: Ho ho, why, certainly, Poppin' Fresh!  I owe my robust
          physique to your tubes of triple-bleached goo.
   Homer: Woo hoo!  [runs out] Hey, everybody: if you want to ask Burns
          for a favor, now's the time!  He's doped up, or dying, or
          something.
    Hans: [running in] Uh, excuse me: I'd like to request $17 for a
          push-broom rebristling.  [shows broom with no bristles on it]
   Burns: Why, it's that delightful TV leprechaun.  I'm going to get
          your Lucky Charms.  [starts a drill]
    Hans: Oh, no: my brains.
-- They're magically...dendrite-icious?, 

[End of Act One.  Time: 6:00]

On the backs of each of Otto's, Apu's and Moe's T-shirt, Homer writes
"Pin Pals" with a black marker.

Krusty: [looking over] Hey, nice quote uniforms, endquote.
  Kent: [pretending] This just in, a new addition to our worst-dressed
        list: those guys!  [his team laughs]
   Apu: Oh, forget this.  I am far too fragile to withstand an evening
        of barbs like that.
 Homer: Aw, come on: if we quit now, we'll _never_ know how badly
        they're going to beat us!
   Moe: Yeah, you're right.  That's the kind of thing that would haunt
        you.
-- Moe, arbiter of bad dreams, 

The Bumblebee Man rolls a strike as his team cheers.  "Si!" he exclaims.

Pedro: Buenas noches, senoritas!
  Moe: What'd he say?  What'd he say?  Was that about me?
-- Only about your feminine side, 

Otto's up for the Pin Pals next.  He tries to talk himself out of
choking, and bowls...only to leave himself with a 7-10 split.  "Oh, man!
I _knew_ I was going to choke."  Moe observes, "Well, that's a funny
looking strike."

Homer: Come on, guys!  Let's be the team that supports each other.
        [chanting] You can do it, Otto!  You can do it, Otto!
       Help each other out: that'll be our motto!
        [Apu and Moe join in] You can do it, Otto!  You can do it, Otto!
  Apu: Make this spare; I'll give you free gelato!
  Moe: Then back to my place, where I will get you blotto!
Homer: Domo Arigato, Mr. Roboto.
  All: You can do it, Otto!  You can do it --
 Otto: Uh, guys?  I made the spare.  We won!
  All: [pause] Yay!
-- The power of teamwork, 

They all cheer, shake up their beers, and spray each other.  The lane
manager Uncle Al comes up to them and informs them, "Those beers are $5
apiece."  They stop, squeeze the beer our of their shirts and hair back
into the bottles, recap them, and hand them back.

Homer recounts the victory to Marge in bed that night.

Homer: Let me set the scene for you, Marge.
Marge: All right.
Homer: It's a 7-10 split.
Marge: Uh huh?
Homer: The hardest shot in bowling.  It was all up to me --
Marge: Oh!
Homer: -- so I got up all my courage.  Right away, my lips started to
       move, and I came up with the chant that won the match!
Marge: Who knocked down the pins?
Homer: [annoyed] I don't know.  You know, some guy, er...Otto, I guess.
Marge: Good for him!
Homer: Yes, but -- Marge, you're not -- you're missing the point!  The
       individual doesn't matter.  It was a team effort, and I was the
       one who came up with the whole team idea...me!
Marge: I can't believe Otto picked up a 7-10 split -- he's phenomenal!
Homer: But --
Marge: Wow!
-- Marge, conoisseur of true bowling acumen, 

Skinner holds an assembly in the school auditorium.

 Skinner: Several days ago, a violent riot erupted incited by an
          inflammatory T-shirt slogan.  No, no, now don't try to
          remember what that slogan was!  To ensure that this frenzied
          dance of destruction is never repeated, I have decided
          starting Monday, all students will be required to wear
          uniforms.
Everyone: [gasps] Uniforms?!
           [Bart winces and ducks as paper and a shoe are thrown at him]
           [Lunch Lady Doris puts "Spanish Flea" on]
   Doris: Say hello to our little genius, Martin, who looks even smarter
          in this vest and short-pant combination from Mr. Boy of Main
          Street.
          Or, how about little Lisa Simpson?  She'll have no reason to
          play the blues in this snappy ensemble topped of with a saucy
          French beret that seems to scream, [French accent] "Silence!"
           [people throw paper and a shoe at her]
          {[a guy walks in the back door with boxes on a trolley]}
 Skinner: {All right, pick your size: extra small or extra large.  We've
          got both.  No pushing, now!  I've -- what?
           [Doris whispers in his ear] Oh.  I've just been informed
          we've run out of extra large.}

At the bowling lane, Homer and his teammates continue their chant thing.

All but Moe: Go, Moe!  Go, Moe!
             Don't make Homer shout out "D'oh"!
              [Moe rolls a strike]
        All: Yay!
-- For want of scansion, the match was won, 

{Patty and Selma, on the losing team, sigh.  Someone moves the Pin Pals'
card from 4th to 3rd on the league standings chart.}

{Against Wiggum's team, Apu rolls a strike to the cheers of his
teammates.}

Wiggum: {All right, Snake: make us proud.

 Snake: {[winding up] One, two, three!

Wiggum: {Uh...we forfeit.

-- Ten small steps to freedom, 

{The Pin Pals move from third to second.}  They eye the trophy in the
display case.

Homer: There it is, boys: the championship trophy.
  Apu: We will never possess it.  The Holy Rollers have won it five
       years in a row.
        [the Rollers (Ned, Maude, and the Lovejoys) look piously at the
       heavens as a light shines on them]
  Moe: Ehh, they think they're so high and mighty just because they
       never got caught driving without pants.

Bart and Lisa walk into the kitchen dressed in their uniforms.

     Bart: [whining] Mom, my slingshot doesn't fit in these pockets.
           And these shorts leave nothing to the imagination.  These
           uniforms suck!
    Marge: Bart!  Where do you pick up words like that?
    Homer: [on phone] Yeah, Moe, that team sure did suck last night.
           They just plain sucked!  I've seen teams suck before, but
           they were the suckiest bunch of sucks that ever sucked.
    Marge: Homer!  Watch your mouth!
    Homer: Aw, I gotta go.  My damn weiner kids are listening.  [hangs
           up]
     Lisa: We are not weiners!
    Homer: Then what are you dressed like that for?
Bart+Lisa: They made us.
    Homer: "Oh, they made us."  That's loser-talk!  You gotta start
           acting more like me and my team, the future champions of the
           world.  Nothing's going to stop us now!

Smithers: {Uh, Sir, that's a check for your _boweling_.}
   Burns: {Oh, yes.  That's very important.}
Smithers: {Yes, Sir.  Remember that month you didn't do it?}
   Burns: {Yes...that was unpleasant for all concerned.  Anyway, back to
          the checks.}
          Stop everything!  I don't remember writing a check for
          bowling.
Smithers: Hmm...the memo says, "To my pal, Poppin' Fresh."
   Burns: Ah yes, that greedy, grasping, glob of chemicals.
Smithers: Probably one of your ether-induced hallucinations, Sir.  I'll
          check the employee file to see who could pull off such an
          impersonation.
           [pushes a remote; a TV turns on]
          Hmm.  Now, it was either Pops Freshenmeyer --
           [on the screen, Pops and Poppin' are overlaid] -- or Homer
          Simpson.
           [Homer and Poppin' are overlaid; "Perfect match" flashes]
   Burns: Homer Simpson, eh?  Let's shut down this bowling scam right
          now.

        Homer: By the way, guys: rhyming "Homer" with "homer"?  [kisses
               fingers]
        Burns: [walking in] Look at them, Smithers, enjoying their
               embezzlement.
     Smithers: [dramatic] I have a much uglier word for it, Sir:
               misappropriation.
               Simpson!
                [Homer sees them and tosses his ball away; someone
               screams]
        Burns: [menacing] Listen here...I want to join your team.
        Homer: You want to join my _what_?
     Smithers: You want to _what_ his team?
        Burns: I've had one of my unpredictable changes of heart.
               Seeing these fine young athletes, reveling in the
               humiliation of a vanquished foe...mmm, I haven't felt
               this energized since my last, er, boweling.

 Otto: Oh, man!  He'll blow our winning streak.
  Moe: Yeah.  Call this an unfair generalization if you must, but old
       people are no good at everything.
Homer: Look, guys, it's not that simple: he's my boss.  I'll tell you
       what: I'll give him a shot, and if he stinks, it'll be easier to
       tell him no.

A bell rings at school; the students file past in lockstep.

Skinner: Ah, these uniforms are godsend.  Horseplay is down 40%,
         youthful exuberance has been cut in half, high spirits are at
         an all-time low.
  Doris: They've even begun blinking in unison.

Skinner: I love that sound!

  Edna: Now, children, while you're having quiet time, I'm going to make
        sure my desk is exactly parallel to the rear wall.

  Bart: [holding his slingshot] Oh.  There's something I used to do in
        this situation, but...can't...remember!
Nelson: Ha...ho?
-- The deprogramming begins, 

At the bowling alley, it's Otto that's been kicked off the team.

      Otto: Whoa.  I can't believe I got booted off the team for Mr.
            Businessman.  Pfft!  I bet I'll get respect once I get that
            Harvard diploma.  [turns to prize machine]
             [Burns struggles with a ball; he pushes it into the gutter]
     Burns: Look at that!  All the way to the end with only one push.

       Well, Mr. -- ouch!  Mr. Burns, next week is the big championship
       game, and --
Burns: Ah, yes, that silly championship.  [laughs] The only ship worth a
       damn is friendship.
        [makes a paper boat] Look, here comes the friend ship, sailing
       your way!
        [puts it on Homer's beer; it sinks]
       Oh, here: let me get that, friend.  [pulls it out]
       Whoops.  Lost a nail.  Well, that's leprosy for you.
-- Uh, cheers, 

At school, it's recess time.  Three uniformed children bounce a ball in
unison.  Six children swing slowly in unison on a swingset.

    Todd: [without enthusiasm] You're "it".  [touches Lisa]
    Lisa: [to Milhouse] Now you are the one who is "it".
Milhouse: [looking down] Understood.
Chalmers: Well, I've got to hand it to you, Seymour: these drab student
          coverings have created the perfect distraction-free
          environment, thus preparing the children for permanent
          positions in tomorrow's mills and processing facilities.  Hah!
          Best of all, with less than a minute to go before I leave,
          absolutely nothing has gone wrong --
           [it thunders; rain starts to fall]
 Skinner: We -- well, it is starting to rain, but I can hardly be blamed
          for that, can I?
           [Chalmers begins laughing; Seymour joins in]
Chalmers: Yes, very good.
-- Tag, uniform style, 

The grey dye starts to wash out of the children's uniforms, leaving
almost tie-dye colors in its place.

    Bart: Wow!  Look at all the colors, man!
    Lisa: Red, green, yellow, orange!  I remember all of these.
Milhouse: I'm freaking out!
   Jimbo: Hey: something's coming back to me.  Down with homework!
  Martin: [dancing, shirtless] And down with uniforms!  Yay!
           [other children cheer and riot]
Chalmers: [getting hit on the head with balls, etc.]  Ow.  Ow.  Ow!  Ow.
          Skinner!  Why aren't these uniforms colorfast?!
 Skinner: I don't understand it.  I got them at the same place I buy
          Mother's dresses, and -- Good Lord!  Mother's in the park!
          [runs]
Chalmers: Now this, I gotta see!  [walks off]
-- For every action..., 

Homer complains to Marge about his new team member.

Homer: Oh, Marge, we were so close to winning the championship.  Now,
       thanks to Burns, it's never going to happen.  And I spend so much
       time building that trophy case.
        [shot of pieces of wood with an Oscar atop them]
Marge: Homer, maybe Mr. Burns will bowl a great game, and you will win
       your championship!
Homer: So you're saying...we're definitely going to win?  Woo hoo!
        [grabs Oscar] I won't need _this_ any more!
        [tries flushing it; tries again and again and again]
       Marge, someone broke the toilet!
-- Oscar vs. bowling trophy, 

At the bowling lanes, Homer, Moe, and Apu prepare their balls.  The Holy
Rollers walk in in monk's garb, their hoods drawn.  They lower their
hoods and look to the heavens as light bathes them.

  Moe: Don't worry about nothing, Homer.  I have a feeling that Mr.
       Burns is going to have a little accident that might keep him from
       bowling with us tonight, heh heh heh.
Burns: [walking in, leaning on Smithers] Smithers, I'm afraid I won't be
       able to play tonight.  My old gimpy knee has gone akimbo again.
  Moe: [masked, with a cane] Take that!
        [bashes Burns on the leg with a cane, runs off]
Burns: Ooh!  Smithers...that precision assault popped it back into
       place.  Thank you, masked stranger!
-- Tonya Harding's bodyguard, he ain't, 

  Moe: D'oh, he's going to ruin everything!  All right, that's it,
       Homer: either Burns goes, or Moe goes.
  Apu: Yes, I am afraid that I am going to have to make a similar threat
       with my name in place of Moe's name.
Burns: So, who's ready to kick some Christian keister?
Homer: Oh, uh...Mr. Burns?  As team captain, it's my duty to inform you
       that --
Burns: Oh, I almost forgot.  I brought you all a little something.
        [pulls out a professionally-designed Pin Pals T-shirt]
  Moe: Aw, would you look at that?  "Pin Pals".
  Apu: At last, I finally have a garment fine enough to be married in.
Burns: I've always been wealthy, but this is the first time I ever
       felt...rich.
Homer: [sobs] Aw.
Burns: Now, Homer, you were about to say something to me.
Homer: [pause] You're off the team.
Burns: I -- what?
  Moe: [awkward laugh] He's just ribbing you, Monty.
        [Apu agrees; they all laugh]
-- How quickly they forget, 

Mr. Burns tosses a ball weakly down the lane while Ned, Maude, Helen,
and Timothy all bowl strikes.  "Yay!" cheers Ned.  "Hallelujah," intones
Timothy.  Burns' ball rolls into the gutter as his team groans.

From behind the pins, we see them all scatter as Apu stands at the other
end.  The nest shot shows Moe standing at the other end.  The next shot
shows Burns standing at the other end.  He stands aside and says, "Nice
one, Homer."  Homer thanks him.

Homer rolls another strike.  Apu notes, "OK, the Holy Rollers are ahead
by one pin and we only have one bowler left: Mr. Burns."  Mr. Burns
walks to get a ball and his fingers flap in the wind from the ball
return.  His team sighs as he winds up and delivers a weak ball that
rolls straight into the gutter.  "Well, next time, a few steps more
toward center, don't you think?" he asks jovially.  "Goodbye, trophy,"
Homer says to the gleaming trophy.

Burns' second shot teeters on the edge of the gutter.  Otto, at the game
machine, has latched onto a screw without realizing it.  "Whoa, whatever
I got a hold of, it's _big_!"  The ball rolls on the edge and glances
off two pins, making them wobble.  Otto, with a final grunt, dislodges
the screw, pulling the leg of the machine and toppling it.  The
vibration causes the two pins to fall.  "Yes!" cheer Burns' teammates.
"Excellent," says Burns.  Otto looks down at the prizes, grabs the
lobster harmonica, and cries, "Yes!"

Homer: Woo hoo!  We won!  We won!
        [Homer, Apu, and Moe dance while the kid gets the trophy from
       the case]
        [Homer holds it, but Burns takes it]
Burns: You mean, _I_ won.
  Apu: But we were a team, Sir.
Burns: Oh, I'm afraid I've had one of my trademark changes of heart.
       You see, teamwork will only take you so far.  Then, the truly
       evolved person makes that extra grab for personal glory.  Now, I
       must discard my teammates, much like the boxer must shed roll
       after roll of sweaty, useless, disgusting flab before he can win
       the title.  Ta!
        [walks off with Smithers]
Homer: I guess some people never change.  Or, they quickly change and
       then quickly change back.
  Moe: You know what?  We don't need him, or his trophy!  We got each
       other, huh?
        [general murmurs of agreement]
-- The only ship worth a damn, 

Homer's three former teammates stand outside the gates of Burns'
compound and cheer Homer on.  "Go, Homer!  You're our man.  If you can't
do it, no one can!"  Homer smashes a window at Burns' place and grabs
the trophy, setting off the alarm and releasing the hounds.  He makes a
dash for the gate, but doesn't make it over in time.  The dogs tear him
to shreds as Otto remarks, "Well, I guess no one can."  Moe cries, "Run
before they're through feeding!"  They do so as Homer continues to be
torn apart.

EPISODE SUMMARY: 
[Syndication cuts are marked in curly braces "{}" and are courtesy of
Frederic Briere.]

On TV...

Announcer 1: Live, from the famous brown sands of Public Beach,
             Delaware, it's the Grand Nationals of Sand Castle Building
             preview.
      Homer: [whining] Ohh, Saturday afternoon TV is so boring.
Announcer 2: Bikini girls...
      Homer: [brightening at picture] Huh?
Announcer 2: Dune buggies...
      Homer: [brighter] Hmm!
Announcer 2: Daredevil surfers...
      Homer: [gasps]
Announcer 2: Ordinarily, this beach would be swarming with 'em.  But not
             today, ho ho, no.  They've all been cleared out to make way
             for painstaking sand preparation.
Announcer 1: That's right, Dick.  You know, this year, everyone's abuzz
             about one thing: the absence of Mark Rodkin.
Announcer 2: [looking to his left] Oh, wait.  There he is.
-- No doubt a Fox network special, 

Marge walks in.

Homer: [yawns] Marge, I'm bored.
Marge: Why don't you read something?
Homer: Because I'm trying to _reduce_ my boredom.
Marge: Well, you could hand out these flyers for the neighborhood
       rummage sale.  You'd get some fresh air and exercise.
Homer: Ehh, I'll do it anyway.  [grabs Bart] Come on, Boy: we're going
       to see the neighbors!
-- Bart, unwitting accomplice, 

Father and son walk down to a corner where there's a street sign.

Homer: Good old Evergreen Terrace: the swankiest street in the classiest
       part of Pressboard Estates.
 Bart: Well if you love it so much, why are you always littering?
Homer: [finishing a canned drink] It's easier, duh.  [litters]
-- Homer contributes to urban blight, 

The pair walk off.  Apu washes his convertible T-Bird on his driveway
while listening to Cheap Trick.

  Apu: [singing along badly] The Dream Police, they live inside of my
       bed,
       The Dream Police, they come to me in my head,
       The Dream Police, they're going to direct me now,
       Oh nooo...
        [Bart and Homer walk up]
       Howdy, neighbors!  May I spray you with the hose in a playful
       fashion?
Homer: Uh...spray the boy.
        [Apu does so]
       Well!  Ready for the big rummage sale?
  Apu: Oh, yes, indeed.  I've got nothing but time until they fix that
       malfunctioning Squishee machine.
        [the Kwik-E-Mart is filled with green liquid]
        [two scuba divers operate a blow torch in front of the machine]
        [Jimbo swims in and pilfers two six packs from the freezer]
-- There's nothing some people won't do, 

Homer and Bart walk past a particularly posh-looking house.

Homer: Hey!  I never noticed _this_ place.
 Bart: Dad, it's right across the street from us!  That fancy house'll
       never sell.  Nobody who could afford it would want to live in
       _this_ neighborhood.
Homer: Hey, what's wrong with this neighborhood?  [at the house] Big
       shot!  Too good to buy a house here, snobby?
 Bart: Who are you talking to, Homer?
Homer: The guy who doesn't live there.
-- Well, duh, 

Marge and Homer go through old things in the attic in preparation for
the big sale.

Marge: Can we get rid of this Ayatollah T-shirt?  Khomeini died years
       ago.
Homer: But, Marge!  It works on _any_ Ayatollah: Ayatollah Nakhbadeh,
       Ayatollah Zahedi...even as we speak, Ayatollah Razmada and his
       cadre of fanatics are consolidating their power.
Marge: I don't care _who's_ consolidating their power.
        [holds up something else] Well, we don't need _this_.
Homer: [sputters] Marge!  That's the Rhinestone Nights Fashion Gun.  I
       need it to rhinestone up my old clothing.
        [holds up a jacket]
Marge: [reading it] Who's "Disco Stu"?
Homer: Oh, er, I wanted to write "Disco Stud" but I ran out of space --
       {not that Disco Stu didn't get his share of the action...}
-- Preparations for the rummage sale, 

The big day arrives.  Eddie and Lou string up police tape around the
rummage sale tables while Ned walks from table to table with a portable
microphone announcing the wares.

       Ned: So, if you're looking for a half-bag of charcoal briquettes
            or an artificial Christmas tree (trunk only), come on over
            to the Hibbert table, pronto!
            Well, sir, looks like we've got some nice items at table
            Glick...like this!  What the heckaroony is this, Mrs. Glick?
Mrs. Glick: [into the mike] It is a candy dish, Ned.  $90.
       Ned: Uh huh.  Well, I -- uh, I guess you could put a lot of nice
            things in there --
Mrs. Glick: No!  Just candy, Ned.  $90.
-- Perhaps it's from the Ming Dynasty?, 

As Ned sees someone putting a "Sold" sticker across the posh house, he
notes, "Well, looks like _somebody_ sold something today."

At Marge's table, Principal Skinner eyes some of the goods.

  Marge: Are you interesting in that motorized tie rack, Principal
         Skinner?  [turns it on]
Skinner: Hmm.  It's awfully loud.
  Marge: Well, you can always take the motor out and use it as an
         ordinary tie rack.  [does so]
Skinner: [scoffs] But now the ties are motionless, and those in back are
         virtually inaccessible.  Well, it's a moot point, as I have
         only one tie to begin with.  I believe I'll pass.  [walks off]
          [pops head back] Have you sold that tie rack yet?
  Marge: No.
Skinner: I'll take it.
-- Spanky can't pass up a bargain, 

Ned continues his monologue.

    Ned: Now, folks, nothing spells "fun" like rhinestones on a dungaree
         jacket!  [holds up "Disco Stu" jacket]
    Man: Stu!  You should buy that!
    Stu: Hey: Disco Stu doesn't advertise.
  Homer: Uh, hey, Ned, let me help you with that.
          [grabs mike] Hey, everybody!  Who thinks Flanders should shut
         up?
          [everyone cheers; Ned looks worried]
         So, anyone here from Evergreen Terrace?
          [everyone cheers]
         I think this is the best neighborhood in town!  Anybody agree
         with me?
          [everyone cheers]
   Carl: Yeah, you're the king, Homer!
 Wiggum: King of the neighborhood!
  Homer: [holding up T-shirt] Say, that Ayatollah thinks he's better
         than America.  Is he right?
          ["No!  Boo!" etc., except one man says "Yes..."]
         Well, for only $5, you could sock it to him in style!
    Moe: Right here!  [pays; gets shirt]
  Homer: And, for the man who has everything, a tie rack motor!
Skinner: I'll take that.
-- Hidden emcee talent, 

Wiggum begins playing some music on one of those cheesy little
electronic keyboards from the early 80s.

   Homer: [singing] Hey, big spender: dig this blender!
          Rainbow suspenders -- hey, big spender!
Everyone: We surrender!
   Homer: Speeend some dough at table three.
           [everyone cheers and holds up money]
           [a moving truck pulls up, and everyone turns to look]
   Homer: Thank you, neighbors!  Thank you.  Now, let's give it up for
          table five!
           [singing] Ah, ah, ah, ah, Table Five, Table Five,
           [Disco Stu starts dancing]
          Ah, ah, ah, ah, Table Fiiiive --
           [Wiggum runs off to watch the movers]
          Table five -- [spoken] Hey, what's the big deal?  It's just
          some guy moving in.
     Stu: Ahem.  Disco Stu likes disco music.
-- The show must go on, 

Ned takes off too, dragging the microphone behind him.  The steel gates
to the house open, revealing two large men in black and an old man.
Everyone stares.

George: Hi there, neighbors.  Uh, I'm...George Bush.
         [everyone stares]
        Former _president_ George Bush?
        Everyone: Oh, OK! etc.  [mild applause]
 Homer: OK, let's give it up for the new guy.  Now, let's all turn
        around and pay attention to me again.  {Hello?  Hello?  Hello!}
-- The new kid in town, 

[End of Act One.  Time: 6:23]

Homer and Bart peek out in between the venetian blind slats across the
street.

 Bart: Wow, a former president living right across the street.
Homer: Oh, why did he have to move in on _my_ territory?  Look at him.
       Thinks just because he led the free world, he can act like a big
       shot!  Stupid President...why couldn't he just stay in his own
       state?
 Lisa: Actually, this _is_ one of the nine states where Mr. Bush claims
       residency, Dad.  I wouldn't have voted for him, but it's nice to
       have a celebrity in the neighborhood.
Homer: {Wait a minute...if _Lisa_ didn't vote for him...and _I_ didn't
       vote for him --}
Marge: {You didn't vote for anybody.}
Homer: {I voted for Prell to go back to the old glass bottle.  After
       that, I became deeply cynical.}
-- A rare glimpse of Homer, member of the electorate, "Two Bad
    Neighbors"

Ned Flanders drags his family over to meet the new neighbors.

   Ray: [scrutinizing Ned's license] And your business here, Mr.
        Flanders?
   Ned: Well, sir, I'm welcoming the Bushes on behalf of the
        Neighborhood Association.
George: [hammering "The Bushes" sign] Never mind about that, Ray.  Just
        give them a quick pass with the metal detector and let 'em on
        in.  Hey, Bar!  The neighbors are here.
-- The formalities of ex-presidential visitations, 

The Flanders clan walk in.

   Ned: Howdily doodily, there, President Bush -- or should I say,
        "President Neighbor"!  I'm Ned Flanders, and this is Maude, Rod,
        and Todd.
George: Well, howdily doodily yourself, there, Ned.  This is my wife
        Barbara.  I call her Bar.  Would you like some lemonade?
   Ned: Tip top notch!
George: Okily dokily.  [hands Ned some]
   Ned: Thankily dankily!
         [they both drink]
        Great-ilicious!
George: Scrump-diddley-eriffic!
  Both: Fine and dandy like sour candy!
George: Bar's a whiz with cold drinks, aren't you, Bar?  Don't
        understand lemonade myself -- not my forte...
-- Not a George of all trades, 

  Maude: What brings you to Springfield?
Barbara: Well, George and I just wanted to be private citizens again --
         go where nobody cared about politics.  So we found the town
         with the lowest voter turnout in America.
 George: Just happy to be here among good, average people with no
         particular hopes or dreams.
    Rod: But, Mr. President, we're not all good people.
   Todd: There's one little boy you should watch out for.  He's a bad,
         _bad_ little boy.
    Ned: [nervous laugh] Now Todd, don't _scare_ the president.
          [Bart skateboards by as evil music plays]
-- Bart, worse than Gabbo?, 

Bush goes jogging with Tim Lovejoy, Dr. Hibbert, and Lenny, and a
friendly-looking mutt.  Homer watches them jog past from his hammock.

        Homer: Huh.  Look at those phonies, sucking up to Bush.
                [SLH barks and runs off after them]
               {I guess you might say he's barking up the wrong Bush.
               [laughs]}
Homer's Brain: {There it is, Homer: the cleverest thing you'll ever say
               and nobody heard it.}
        Homer: {D'oh!}
-- The solitary comedian, 

After the jog, Bush walks into his living room.

 George: [sighs] Just going to relax with my "U.S.  News and World
         Whatnot".  [opens magazine] Oh, good: they're roasting the new
         guy.
   Bart: [in the style of Dennis the Menace] Hello, Mr. Bush!
Barbara: George, this is a neighborhood boy, Bart Simpson.  He came over
         to say hi.
 George: [unimpressed] Hello.
   Bart: Hi.  Hey, what's this?
 George: My electric card shuffler.  Don't go near that --
          [Bart plays with it, and cards fly]
         Now, I _told_ you...oh, those cards are from Air Force One, and
         they only give you so many packs!
Barbara: Oh, George, boys will be boys.  Bart's just being friendly.
         Why don't you get off that sofa and show Bart your photos?
 George: Oh, but he'll gunk 'em all up.  His hands are probably covered
         with mud and cookies.
          [Bart shows his clean hands]
         Oh, he probably stole a napkin.
-- No student of Occam, Bush, 

Bush, dutifully, shows Bart his photos.

   Bart: Who's that, George?
 George: That's me with Charlton Heston.  He was --
   Bart: Who's that, George?
 George: Er -- see, you wouldn't know him.  That's Bob Mosbacher.  He
         was secretary of --
   Bart: That's a dumb name.  Who's that, George?
 George: Maybe _he_ thinks "Bart" is a dumb --
   Bart: How many times were _you_ president, George?
 George: {Just once.  Bar!  Is it time for dinner yet?}
Barbara: {[off-camera] I'm making rice!  It'll be a while.}
   Bart: {Did your Secret Service goons ever whack anyone, George?}
 George: [indignant] You know, in my day, little boys didn't call their
         elders by their first name.
   Bart: Yeah?  Well, welcome to the 20th century, _George_.
 George: {[muttering] I'll kick you right out of the 20th century,} you
         little --
-- Bush meets his ten-year-old match, 

The next day, Homer speed off to Krusty Burger.

 Homer: Oh, man: I've only got one minute 'till they stop serving those
        breakfast balls!
         [stops behind Bush at the drive thru]
George: Let's see, now...what do you folks have here, huh?  Hmm, a
        "Krusty Burger"...that doesn't sound too appetizing.  What kind
        of stew do you have today?
   Kid: [through order box] Uh...we don't have stew.
         [Homer honks impatiently]
   Ray: Sir, why don't you just have the cheeseburger?
George: Aw, that's really more of a weekend thing, Ray.
 Homer: Hey, jerk!  Move your fanny!
George: That guy's louder than World War II.  Ray, go see what the
        rhubarb is, will you?
         [Ray goes back toward Homer's car]
   Ray: Sir, could you pop your hood?
         [Homer does so; Ray disables the horn]
 Homer: Hey: my taxes paid for that horn!
-- George Bush does the drive thru, 

Bart shows up in the Bush garden.

   Bart: Why, hello, Mrs. Bush!
Barbara: Hi, Bart!  Mr. Bush is upstairs napping.
   Bart: You know, your husband's awful grumpy.
Barbara: Oh, that's just his way; he really likes you.  You know, it's
         time for him to get up and work on his memoirs.  Why don't you
         go wake him?
          [a loud horn note blasts]
 George: [waking suddenly] Great Scot, don't touch that!  That's the
         alpenhorn Helmut Kohl gave me.
   Bart: [dropping it] Where'd you get those pyjamas?
 George: They're presidential pyjamas.  You have to be President, and
         you're not President!
   Bart: Yes I am.
 George: [stammers] No, you're not!  [calls out] Bar!
-- George Bush, tattletale, 

Bart rifles through the kitchen cupboards and drawers.

   Bart: Hey, where's your candy?
 George: We don't have any.  Now go away!
Barbara: George!  Older people don't eat much candy, Bart, but I could
         bake you some cookies if you like.
 George: [scoffs] Can't remember the last time she made cookies for
         _me_.
Barbara: What's that?
 George: Oh, nothing.
-- Sparing the rod, 

Homer reads a volume entitled, "U.S.  Presidents," and checks under
BUSH, George.

Homer: All right, his story checks out.  Marge, would you love me more
       if I were President?  'Cause I'll do it if it'll make you happy.
Marge: Homey, as long as you keep the car full of gas, I'm happy.
       [kisses him]
Homer: Well, you can always depend on that.
        [looks furtively out the window at the car]
-- Most of the time, anyway, 

Bush types his memoirs in his car hole.

George: [typing] And since I'd achieved all my goals as President in one
        term, there was no need for a second.  The end.
        Hmm, good memoirs.  Good, not great.  Now, let's look at that
        old outboard -- soup that baby up, rattle a few windows down
        Kennebunkport next May.  [chuckles]
  Bart: Hello, Mr. Bush!
         [skateboards in, knocking a sheet from the memoirs loose]
        Whatcha doin'?
George: Now, don't upset the desk there -- careful!  Don't want to horse
        around with --
  Bart: [spying outboard] Hey, cool!  What does this do?
George: Now don't you pull that cord, young man --
         [Bart pulls it anyway; the motor runs around the room]
        No!  Hey -- Bar!  My motor's gone loco!  [crash!]  Ohh, the
        birdhouse.  My prize orchids!
         [the motor stops; Bart taps it and it starts up again]
         [it stops once again; a lightbulb falls on it and it restarts]
        No, not the memoirs.  Don't even think about it.  Not going to
        happen --
         [he can't prevent it from happening]
  Bart: Whoa, man.
George: Whoa, nothing.  I'm going to do something your daddy should have
        done a long time ago.
         [takes Bart over his knee and spanks him]
        Now go home and think about what you've done, young man!
-- Let that be a lesson to you, 

Homer is incredulous.

Homer: He _spanked_ you?  _You_?  Bart Simpson?
 Bart: I begged him to stop, but he said it was for the good of the
       nation.
  Abe: Big deal!  When I was a pup, we got spanked by Presidents till
       the cows came home.  Grover Cleveland spanked me on two
       nonconsecutive occasions.
Marge: Grampa, I know in your day, spanking was common, but Homer and I
       just don't believe in that kind of punishment.
  Abe: And that's why your no-good kids are running wild!
        [points at Lisa, reading quietly]
-- A counterexample to the theory, 

Homer: First Bush invades my home turf, then he takes my pals, then he
       makes fun of the way I talk -- probably.  Now he steals my right
       to raise a disobedient, smart-alecky son!  Well, that's it!
        [walks across the street] Hey, Bush!  Get out here!
  Ray: Excuse me, Sir: where are you going?
Homer: I'm going to punch George Bush in the face.
  Ray: OK.  Is he expecting you?
-- Just doing his job, 

Homer sees Bush on his porch.

 Homer: Hey!  You owe me an apology.
George: You owe _me_ an apology.  If you were any kind of a father,
        you'd have disciplined that boy a long time ago.
   Ray: You want to step back, Sir?  You're trampling the flowers.
 Homer: Ooh!  Hiding behind your goons, eh, Bush?  Well _you_ are a
        _wimp_!
George: [with trembling lips] Wimp, am I?  Agent Johnson, Agent Heintz,
        you men stand down.
         [the gate opens and Homer walks in]
        All right, Mister: you want trouble?  You're going to get
        trouble.
 Homer: Oh, I want trouble, all right.
George: Then you're going to get trouble.
 Homer: No, _you're_ going to get trouble.
George: Oh, that's good, that's good, 'cause I _want_ trouble.
 Homer: Then we're agreed there'll be trouble.
George: Oh, yeah, lots of trouble.
 Homer: Trouble it is.
George: For you.  [walks inside, slams door]
 Homer: For -- d'oh!
-- Bubble, bubble, 

[End of Act Two.  Time: 15:04]

Homer and Bart are silhouetted against an upstairs window that evening.

  Homer: [chuckles] This is going to be sweet.  Two hundred bottle
         rockets and George Bush doing toe touches by an open window!
   Bart: You get one up his butt, it's a million points.
          [Homer flicks a lighter]
          [fireworks erupt outside the Bushes]
Barbara: [yawns] Why don't you just say you're sorry, George?
 George: Because I'm right!  Oh, no, I'm going to fix their wagon good.
         I've pulled some pranks in my time...[shakes spray paint]
          [ banner hangs from his house next day]
Hibbert: I don't understand.  Are you saying you and Barbara are bad
         neighbors?
 George: No!  That's not Bar and me, it's them!
    Ned: Who, Maude and me?
 George: No, the man and his boy.  You know, the -- the boy is named
         Bart.  I don't know the name of the man.  Bar!  What's the name
         of the man?
Barbara: [off-camera] I'm not getting involved, George.
 George: Look, just never mind.  I thought the banner was pretty
         straightforward, but I'll just take it down.
-- Misunderstood, 

Bush sulks on the couch.

 Barbara: George, it's time to get dressed.
  George: N'uh huh.  Not going outside today, not with those neighbors.
          Staying right here till my speech to the Elk's club.
   Homer: [knocking at door] Yoo hoo!
  George: Who is it?
           [looks through spy hole without glasses on, sees two figures]
   Homer: It's your sons, George Bush Jr. and Jeb Bush.  {Come outside,
          Dad.}
  George: {Oh, good.}  Bar, the boys are out in the front yard.
          _They'll_ help me think of a plan to get those Simpsons.
 Barbara: Oh, George, is that all you ever think about?  The boys
          probably just want a letter of recommendation.
  George: [opening door] Boys?  [Homer pulls them out of the way] Where
          are you going?
   Homer: OK, Son: give him the glue!
           [Bart squeezes some glue onto Bush's hair]
           [Homer stuffs a multicolored afro on top]
           [they run off, laughing]
  George: [at the Elk's club] And that's why I will continue to oppose
          teen alcoholism in all its forms!
           [everyone claps]
          Now, are there any questions?  [everyone puts their hand up]
          -- keeping in mind that I already explained about my hair.
Everyone: Oh yeah, that's right. etc.  [putting hands down]
-- Burns goes hippie, 

Bush takes his four by four and spins donuts on the Simpson front lawn,
spraying mud in all directions.

 Marge: President Bush is driving on our lawn!  He must be lost.
 Homer: [threatening] He's not lost.
  Bart: Looks like we're experiencing some blowback from the wig
        offensive.
 Homer: It's time to hit him where he lives.
  Bart: His house?
 Homer: Bingo.  [walks off]
         [later, he and Bart walk through the sewer]
        So I thought to myself, "What would God do in this situation?"
  Bart: [chuckles] Locusts!  [holds box] They'll drive him _nuts_.
 Homer: It's all in the Bible, son: it's the prankster's bible.
         [Bush grinds the wheels into the ground and gets out]
George: Hmm.  Can't decide if this'll be considered feisty, or crazy.
-- I'm voting for the latter, 

Suddenly, Bush sees Homer and Bart walking through the sewer toward his
house.  "Oh, if he thinks George Bush'll stay out of the sewer, he
doesn't know George Bush."  He removes the cover from a grating and hops
down.

George: Hey, turkeys!  Behind you.
         [Bart and Homer turn around]
 Homer: For the last time, Bush, apologize for spanking my boy!
George: Never!  You make him apologize for destroying my memoirs.
 Homer: You didn't tell me you destroyed his memoirs...
         [to Bush] Never!  [charges him]
-- The clear boundary between right and wrong, 

The two grapple and struggle.  Bush throws Homer to the ground, but
Homer flings slime in his eyes, runs around the side of the sewer, and
body slams Bush.  "Yay, Dad!" cheers Bart.

Marge has invited Bar over for tea.

Barbara: I really feel awful about your lawn, Marge.  George can be so
         stubborn when he thinks he's right.
  Marge: Well, Homer, too.  They're so much alike.
Barbara: Too bad they got off on the wrong foot.  It's just like the
         Noriega thing.  Now, he and George are the best of friends.
-- Bygones, 

Under the street, Homer and George pant.  Bush removes a piece from his
watch and pulls out a length of piano wire.  "Here's a little something
we learned in CIA," he grins.  Bart releases the locusts on Bush,
inciting them to "Get him, boys!"  Above-ground, Mikhail Gorbachev
brings a gift to Bush's house and rings the doorbell.  "Hello?  Hello!"

The sewer grate pops off, and out come Homer and Bush, still fighting.

 George: I'll ruin you like a Japanese banquet!  I'll take your head and
         -- Gorbachev!  Heh, what are you doing here?
Mikhail: I just dropped by with present for warming of house.  Instead,
         find you grappling with local oaf.
  Homer: Oh, brought some of your commie friends to help you fight
         dirty, eh?
 George: But Mikhail, they put a wig on my head, my memoirs --
Barbara: George!  This is the last straw.  You apologize to Homer right
         now!
 George: But Bar, [quietly] we can't show any weakness in front of the
         Russians.
Barbara: [reproachful] George...
 George: [pause] Yes, dear.
Mikhail: [speaks Russian to his driver, and laughs]
-- No translation needed, 

George: I'm sorry I spanked your boy, Homer.
 Homer: Woo hoo!  In your face, Bush.  Now apologize for the tax hike.
-- Giving him an inch..., 

Bush frowns, and walks off.

Barbara goes to say goodbye to Marge.

Barbara: It's a shame it didn't work out, Marge, but George just felt
         this neighborhood brought out the worst in him, and --
          [Bush honks his horn impatiently]
         -- oh, my.  Well, so long.
          [Bar gets in; they drive off]
  Marge: Bye bye.
-- So endeth another chapter, 

No sooner have the Bushes departed that another moving truck pulls in
along with a car with license plate "Mr. Duh".

Gerry: Hi!  Pleased to meet you, I just moved in.  My name is Gerry
       Ford.
Homer: [gasps] Former President Gerald Ford?  Put her there!  I'm Homer
       Simpson!
Gerry: Say, Homer, do you like football?
Homer: Do I ever!
Gerry: Do you like nachos?
Homer: Yes, Mr. Ford.
Gerry: Well, why don't you come over and watch the game, and we'll have
       nachos?  And then, some beer.
Homer: Ooh!
        [they walk across the street]
       Gerry, I think you and I are going to get along just --
        [they both trip]
 Both: D'oh!
-- Homer's rumpy doppelganger, 

[End of Act Three.  Time: 21:22]
 EPISODE TITLE: Scenes from the Class Struggle in Springfield


EPISODE SUMMARY: 

Thanks to Jose Lafaurie for correcting this transcription.


The Simpsons watch Bumblebee man on TV.

Oh, he wants that corn so much!
-- Homer watches Bumblebee man, 
     

Abe wants to see what's on the other broadcasts and ends up wrecking
the TV.  From whence the family drop him back off at the Retirement
Castle.  Then the family cheer because now they get to buy a new
TV.

 Bart: Let's go to the Sharper Image.  They've got a TV shaped like a
       '50s diner.
 Lisa: No, let's go to the Nature Company.  They've got a TV assembled
       by Hopi Indians.
-- The Simpsons go to buy a new TV,
     

Marge says they can't afford a store with philosophy just to get a
TV, and the family goes to the Outlet Mall in Ogdenville.  Signs 
pass: "Paved Road Ends - 64 Miles", "Former Japanese Internment Camp
90 Miles", "Ogdenville - 277 Miles"... Homer and Bart check out the 
TVs available in a grey-market store.

   Homer: [gasps] Look at these low, low prices on famous brand-name
	  electronics!
    Bart: Don't be a sap, Dad.  These are just crappy knock-offs.
   Homer: Pfft.  I know a genuine Panaphonics when I see it.  And look,
	  there's Magnetbox and Sorny.
Salesman: [walking up] Listen, I'm not going to lie to you.  Those
	  are all superior machines.  But if you like to watch your TV,
	  and I mean _really_ watch it, you want the Carnivale'.
	   [shows Homer and Bart a TV very similar to their old one]
	  It features two-pronged wall plug, pre-molded hand grip well,
	  durable outer casing to prevent fallapart...
   Homer: Sold.  You wrap it up, I'll start bringing in the pennies.
-- Seems like that TV and me have been together forever,
     

Meanwhile, Lisa and Marge shop for clothes.

   Marge: [holding up a headband] Mmm, honey, I don't think these 
	  clothes are us.
    Lisa: Who are they?
  Cletus: Hey, Brandine.  [holds up a short shirt reading "Classy 
          Lassy"] You can wear this shirt to work.
Brandine: Oh, Cletus.  You know I gotta wear the shirt what Dairy
	  Queen give me.
-- Not even theirs?, 

Lisa discovers a Chanel suit hidden within the racks of the bargain
basement clothes.  It's $90, but marked down from $2800.  Marge
tries it on, and Lisa thinks she looks sophisicated, "just like Mary
Hart", but Marge still isn't convinced...

It wouldn't be right to buy something just for me.  If it were a
suit we all could wear, maybe...
-- Marge tries on a Chanel suit,
     

 Lisa: Come on, Mom, you never treat yourself to anything.
Marge: Oh sure I do.  I treated myself to Sanka not three days ago.
-- You were out of Montreal Morn, I presume?,
     

 Lisa: Just buy [the suit].  You don't have to rationalize everything.
Marge: All right, I will buy it.  It'll be good for the economy.
-- All Keynesian models considered,
     

At home, Marge puts on a classy record and shows off her new dress to
Homer.

Homer: [whistles at Marge] You look great.
Marge: Really?  You like it?  Oh, I'd love to wear this someplace
       special.
Homer: Spurlock's Cafeteria, it is.
-- They got cocktail weenies there,
     

Marge was thinking more along the lines of the symphony or the
theatre...

What's the point of going out?  We're just gonna wind up back here 
anyway.
-- Homer, 

Later, we see an aria being sung, but as a vacuum fires up and
lines of fuzz appear on your view, we see it's on TV.  (Marge is
vacuuming with her suit on.)


Marge buys some foodstuffs from the Kwik-E-Mart, wearing her suit.

Apu: Oh, Mrs. Simpson, you are looking very prosperous today.
     Might I interest you in some of our impulse items here by the
     cash register?  Perhaps a crazy motorized wiggle pen.
      [demonstrates]
     [laughing] Ohh, look at... the craziness.
-- Marge shops at the Kwik-E-Mart wearing a Chanel suit,
     

 Woman: Attendant, I'd like some gas.
   Apu: Yes, I'm sorry, I do not speak English, okay.
 Woman: But you were just talking to...
   Apu: Yes, yes.  Hot dog, hot dog.  Yes sir, no sir.  Maybe, okay.
-- I learned my English from the Police Academy movies,
     

Evelyn: Well, I can't pump [the gas] myself.  I'm calling AAA.
 Marge: [stops her] I used to be a little overwhelmed too, but it's not
	that hard.  I can show you.
Evelyn: Marge, is that you?  Marge Bouvier from high school?
 Marge: Um... yeah.  Hi... hi, Evelyn.
Evelyn: How about that?  Marge, you look wonderful.  And to think I
	heard you married Homer Simpson.
 Marge: I did marry Homer.
Evelyn: [pause] Come, you must show me the pumps.
-- Didn't go to the prom with him, though,
     

Outside, Marge shows Evelyn how to operate the gas pumps...

 Marge: 90% of the time, if the gas isn't pumping, this is your
	problem.  
	 [turns a switch at back which resets the pump]
Evelyn: Automotive skills and fashion sense.  Why, you've come a long
	way from the girl I knew nothing about in high school.
 Marge: We ran with our different crowds.  You had your debutante balls
	and... skinny-dipping, and I had my... home shoe repair course.
Evelyn: Oh Marge, you haven't changed a bit as far as I know.  Say, why
	don't you drop by the country club tomorrow?
	 [drives off]
	Oh, and bring the family. 
	 [Marge watches her pull off and smiles]
	 [Burns pulls up in a quadricycle]
 Burns: [honks horn (awooooga)] You there, fill it up with petroleum
	distillate, and re-vulcanize my tires, post-haste.
-- Love in the Time of Leaded Gasoline and Tiller Steering,
     

Marge gives the family advice on how to behave for the country
club.

Marge: Bart, comb your hair.  Homer, I don't think you should wear a
       short-sleeved shirt with a tie.
Homer: But Sipowicz does it.
Marge: If Detective Sipowicz jumped off a cliff, would you do that too?
Homer: Ohh, wish I was Sipowicz.
 Lisa: Do I have to go?  That country club is a hotbed of exclusionist
       snobs and status-seeking social climbers.
Marge: I've told you, I don't like you using the word "hotbed".
       Please, Lisa, we so rarely get to do things like this.  And
       everybody, everybody _please_ be on your best behavior.  Bart,
       no grifting.
 Bart: [puts a deck of cards in his sleeve] Aw, raspberries.
-- Raspa-raspa-raspberries, 
     

The family arrive at the gates of the country club.

Gatekeeper: Name, please.
     Homer: Simpson family.
     Marge: We're not poor.
	     [looks around nervously]
	    Well, we're not.
-- At the gates of the country club, 
     

The gatekeeper says, "Go on in.  They're expecting you at the
clubhouse."   The Simpsons drive in and "wow" excitedly at their posh
surroundings.

Everybody, keep smiling, and I know we're going to fit right in.
-- Marge, 

The car runs into the golf course and nearly runs over Krusty.


[End of Act One.  Time: 6'27"]

Evelyn welcomes Marge and her family to the country club.

Evelyn: Karin, Gillian, Elyzabeth, Patricia, Rauberta, Susan, meet
	Marge.
	 [the ladies greet Marge]
 Marge: Pleased to meet you.  You look like such a happy bunch... of
	people.
 Susan: That's the trouble with first impressions.  You only get to
	make one.
-- And you just made yours, jealous wannabe,
     

Evelyn reminds the family that they're free to enjoy the club,
but they prefer to wait in the car until Marge is done fitting
in.

Later, Evelyn, Marge, and their warped rich friends discuss the
benefits of mail order...  

I get the sneaking suspicion that L.L. Bean and Eddie Bauer are selling
me the same honey.
-- Susan, 

Marge adds her two cents:

   Marge: I get food in the mail, but in a different way.  Every month,
	  Good Housekeeping arrives in my mailbox bursting with 
	  recipes.  Sometimes the most satisfying meal is the one you
	  cook yourself.
	   [pause from the ladies]
Patricia: Mmm.  That's so true, Marge.  One night, Wif and I came home
	  late.  We decided not to wake Iris, so instead, we microwaved
	  our own soup.  [laughs]
	   [the ladies murmur and agree]
	  Of course, it was a horrible mess, but Iris didn't mind
	  cleaning it up.
-- The secret ingredient is turntables,
     

At home, Marge asks if everyone enjoyed the country club, but the
family have a hard time agreeing.

 Bart: That place is weird.  A man in the bathroom kept handing
       me towels, until I paid him to stop.
Homer: [holding a stack of towels] Should have held out longer,
       boy.
-- You can never have enough towels,
     

 Lisa: The rich are different from you and me
Marge: Yes, they're better.
-- Socially better, 

Today, while the rest of you were being different, I did a very good
job of fitting in.
-- Marge, 

... so good, in fact, that Evelyn gave her a guest pass, and Marge
hopes they might be invited to join.  "Boy, Marge." Homer remarks.  
"You must have really done a number on those rich suckers!"  "Don't
thank me," Marge tells him, "thank my beautiful new suit."

Bart and Lisa observe Kent Brockman's daughter reject a baloney
sandwich, telling the server she asked for abalone.  Lisa is
infuriated, but her tirade is distracted by a man riding a pony.
She cuts her tirade short to find out about the ponies.

Meanwhile, Marge (still wearing the same Chanel suit) plays bridge
with her friends, and discovers she has a winning hand.

Marge: [thinking] Oh, we've got a winning hand, we can take the 
       rest of the tricks.
	[camera pans higher up]
       [thinking] Oh, we'd better be careful.  The purpose of this
       game is to make friends.  You don't make friends by winning.
	[camera pans higher up]
       [thinking] Still, there's nothing more popular than a gracious
       winner.
	[camera pans to the end of her hair]
       [thinking] Don't ask me, I'm just hair.  Your head ended 18 
       inches ago.
-- A hair-brained scheme,
     

Marge plays her hand.  "I believe the rest are ours," she announces.
Rauberta remarks that she and Susan could have stopped her if Susan
had changed to a different suit.  Susan remarks, "I thought that 
perhaps changing suits had gone out of fashion, eh Marge?"  Marge 
"mmm"s to herself.

Homer tries unsuccessfully to hit his golf ball, hitting himself in
the foot.  He then attempts to cheat by changing his score card,
but a fellow golfer tells him that the usual way of cheating is
decreasing your score.  He introduces himself as Tom Kite, PGA golf
pro, and shows Homer how to play.

Tom Kite: Now, you don't want to overthink.
   Homer: Not an issue.
Tom Kite: Keep your head down.
   Homer: [raising his head] Huh?
Tom Kite: Pretend there's no one else here.
	   [Homer scratches his butt with the club and burps]
	  And just go at your own pace. 
	   [Homer hits the ball very close to the hole]
	  Wow, very impressive.  You're a natural, Mr. Simpson.
   Homer: Really?
Tom Kite: Uh huh.  All you need is your own set of clubs, and stay
	  the _hell_ out of my locker!
	   [grabs the clubs]
	  [walking off] You can keep the shoes!
-- You're stuck here! (Mood swings!),
     

At home, Homer reads a book about golfing, while Marge alters her
suit.

Marge, did you know that Kennedy and Lincoln had the same handicap?
-- Homer reads a book about golf,
     

Marge: Homer, please.  I have to alter this suit so it looks
       different for tomorrow.
Homer: [yawns] Just slap some bumper stickers on it and come to bed,
       will you, Marge?
-- Some rhinestones oughta do nicely as well,
     

Her friends at the country club are impressed by Marge's altered
suit.

Rauberta: Love your outfit, Marge.  The vest says "Let's have lunch",
	  but the culottes say "You're paying".
-- At the country club, 

Lisa gallops by on a pony.

Mom, look, I found something more fun than complaining!
-- Lisa rides the pony at the country club,
     

Evelyn tells Marge that if all goes right at Saturday's ball, she
would be willing to sponsor Marge for membership.  Marge says "I'll
be there with bells on", but Susan says, "Where exactly will you be
attaching them to that mangled Chanel suit?"  Marge groans.

Don't worry, Marge.  [Susan's] idea of wit is nothing more than an
incisive observation humorously phrased and delivered with impeccable
timing.
-- Evelyn, 

At work, Homer shows off his golfing talent to Lenny and Carl by
hitting golf balls into the toilet, and impresses them thoroughly
by hitting one into the handicapped stall, seat down.  Meanwhile,
Burns watches him intently on his video monitors.

   Burns: Who is that lavatory linksman, Smithers?
Smithers: Homer Simpson, sir.  One of the fork and spoon operators
	  from sector 7-G.
   Burns: Well, he's certainly got a loose waggle.  Perhaps I've
	  finally found a golfer worthy of a match with Monty Burns,
	  eh?
Smithers: His waggle is no match for yours, sir.  I've never seen you
	  lose a game.  Except for that one in '74 when you let
	  Richard Nixon win.  That was very kind of you, sir.
   Burns: Oh, he just looked so forlorn, Smithers, with his [imitating
          Nixon]  "Oh, I can't go to prison, Monty.  They'll eat me 
	  alive!"
	   [Smithers laughs]
	  I wonder if this Homer Nixon is any relation?
Smithers: Unlikely, sir.  They spell and pronounce their names
	  differently.
   Burns: Bah.  Schedule a game and I'll ask him myself.
-- I run my plant precisely on "shedule",
     
       
At home, Homer tries to talk to Marge about the golfing challenge
he got from Burns, while Marge once again alters her suit.

Oh, this game could mean big things for me, Marge.  If I beat
Mr. Burns, I mean really wallop him bad, I'm sure to get that big
raise I've been gunning for!
-- Homer, unclear on the concept,
     

Marge: All right, all right, but if you win, don't make a
       scene and dance around with your "woo-hoo"s, please!  We
       can't afford a single slipup.  They're judging us.
	[Homer kisses Marge and Lisa, who is on the bed]
 Lisa: Mom, did you like horses when you were my age, 'cause I--?
Marge: I don't know.  Look, tonight is very important.  Mommy has to
       alter her suit so it looks like a totally new suit.
 Lisa: [75 RPM] Mom, do you want to know the fifteen reasons I like
       horses better than cars? One, a horse never has to--
Marge: I really need to concentrate on this, Lisa, would you mind
       just--?
 Lisa: You know how a horse goes like this?  [jumps up and down on
       the bed]  Mom, like this!
Marge: I've already altered this so many times, it's not impossible--
 Lisa: Whinny, whinny!  Mom, mom, mom, mom, mom, mom, mom, mom, mo-m!
Marge: [yelling] LISA, PLEASE!!!
	[pause]
	[Lisa runs out while Marge continues her sewing] 
	[Marge pulls out her altered suit and examines it]
	[Marge pushes on the pedal and her suit gets pulled into the
       sewing machine]
       No!  No, no, no, noooo!
	[pulls out her mangled suit]
       At times like this, I guess all you can do is laugh.
	[5 second pause]
-- Or sit until we fade to black,
     

[End of Act Two.  Time: 14'16"]

Marge seeks help from Patty and Selma.

Marge: I need a formal dress for tonight!
Patty: You've come to the right place.
Selma: We've got classy duds up the yin-yang.
-- No dress too horrible, 
     

The first dress is "Fantasy in Maroon", an exceedingly large dress.
"It's got some cigarette burns, but you can patch them with 
NuVinyl."  Marge puts it in the "Maybe" pile.

Then there's a Halloween costume that's too tight, but somehow made
its way into Selma's regular rotation.

Homer, meanwhile, arrives to play golf with Burns.

Homer: Good morning, Mr. Burns.  Beautiful day to be outside, isn't
       it?
Burns: Rant on, Simpson, but your vainglorious boasting will only add
       savor to my inevitable triumph.
Homer: [pause] Yes.
-- No, 

Homer drives the ball up high, and he yells "Woo-hoo!" while it
flies in the air, but it lands in the sand trap: "D'oh!"  Burns
adds, "Yes, you're in deep d'oh now."  It's Burns' turn, and
he hits the ball far.  Smithers remarks "Perfect as always, sir.
Right on the green."

Homer tries to get the ball out of the sand trap.

Burns: Oh, quit cogitating, Steinmetz, and use an open-faced club.
       The sand wedge!
Homer: Mmm... open-faced club sandwich.
-- One-track mind, 

Marge hurries back to the Ogdenville Outlet Mall.

Homer and Burns advance to hole eight.  "You're four strokes behind,
Simpson," Burns reminds Homer, and proceeds to hit a hook.  But
Smithers uses binoculars to see the ball get on the green.  Homer
bats his club on the ground repeatedly in anger, wondering how
Burns can hit so far, and the club flies away from his hands,
hitting Krusty (being advised by Tom Kite) in the head.  Kite
scurries away.

     Marge: Miss? Miss?  Do you have a Chanel suit or any other
	    high quality clothes?
Saleswoman: No, ma'am, but we do have a shipment of slightly burned
	    Sears activewear coming in this afternoon.
     Marge: Oh, I give up.  [walks away]
    Cletus: What time and how burnt?
-- At night, burnt to a crisp, 
     

Burns and Homer continue their golf game, and Homer hits one far
near the hole, against Smithers' head.  Homer and Burns run to his
aid.

   Burns: Smithers, what are you doing up here?
   Homer: And what are you doing with this ball, and all those other
	  balls?
	   [many anagrammed golf balls pour forth from Smithers'
          clothes]
Smithers: Uh, there are no other balls, just these, uh, reptile eggs.
	  Step away, they're endangered.
   Homer: [puts one in his mouth]  These aren't reptile eggs.  You've
	  been cheating!  No matter where Mr. Burns hits the ball,
	  you put a fresh one on the green.
   Burns: [gasps] Cheating?  For me?  Why, Smithers, that's patently
	  unnecessary.  I'm one of the world's finest golfers.  Why,
	  in all the years you've caddied for me, I've never lost a--
	  [realizing] Oh.
-- Megalomania is shot down again,
     

Smithers would prefer that Homer kept silent so that they could
sponsor him for membership, but Homer scoffs and says that he
wouldn't want to be a member anyway.  "But does your wife?," asks
Burns.  Homer walks away dejected, stepping over Krusty in the
process.

I knew my kind wasn't welcome here.
-- Krusty at the country club,
     

At night, Marge searches one of the posher parts of Springfield
for a Chanel suit, and stops at the source: Chanel.

About to leave for the ball, the family observes Marge's new
dress.  Bart and Lisa both agree that she looks great, and Lisa
adds, "You can do anything with that sewing machine."  Marge
retorts, "No I can't, come on, let's go."  Lisa badgers it out of
Marge that she got it at the Outlet Store at a dollar (fibs, duh)
before Marge screams "Why do you have to question everything
I do?"  "You look nice, is all," Lisa says sadly, and walks
away.

The car pulls into the country club, and Homer drives up to
the entrance.

	[Homer drives to the entrance of the country club]
Marge: Homer, what are you doing?
Homer: I'm driving up to the main building.  They got valet parking.
Marge: We can't drive this up there.  They'll see the dent.  They'll
       see the coat hanger antenna.  Stop the car, we're walking.
Homer: But Marge, valets!  Maybe for once, someone will call me "sir"
       without adding, "You're making a scene."
-- Yes, sir, 

But Marge will have none of it.  She pulls the keys out and they
walk up the hill.

 Homer: I'm going to regale everyone with my anecdote.  You know, the
	one I tried to say on the radio?  Heh, heh.  Who's going to
	"bleep" me this time?
  Bart: I'm going to pose as an Italian count and get some old lady to
	leave me all her money.
  Lisa: I'm going to ask people if they know their servant's last 
	names, or in the case of butlers, their first.
 Marge: No, no, no!  Not tonight!  No vulgarity, no mischief, no
	politics.  Just be good!
	 [an uncomfortable pause]
  Bart: I'm sorry, mom.  I'll behave.
  Lisa: I won't say anything controversial.
 Homer: I just won't say anything, okay, honey?
Maggie: *suck* *suck* *suck* *suck* *suck*
	 [Marge glares at her]
	[silence]
-- Silence of the Laughs,
     

Marge huffs off to the main building.

You kids should thank your mother.  Now that she's a better person,
we can see how awful we really are.
-- Homer at the country club,
     

Marge hears this and her heart unhardens.  She runs back to the
family and takes Maggie in her arms.

Marge: Homey, I like your in-your-face humanity.  I like the way
       Lisa speaks her mind.  I like Bart's--
	[Bart smiles, but it fades]
       I like _Bart_.
	[Bart smiles again]
-- I like your sheets, 

"And I like my old green dress."  Marge lets it out that she spent
her savings on this gown.  But don't worry, she has the receipt
(good for credit in Chanel).  Homer wonders if there's any beer and 
gum there.

Let's go.  I wouldn't want to join any club that would have _this_
me as a member.
-- Marge waxes philosophical,
     

    Lisa: It's okay.  Those snobs would have never made us members,
	  anyway.
	   [at the ball, a huge gala had been set up for OFF]
  Evelyn: Well, I wonder where Marge could be?  She's missing her
	  own initiation.
   Susan: I hope she didn't take my attempt to destroy her too 
	  seriously. [slurps her drink loudly]
   Burns: Where's Homer?  Oh, and to think I spent all afternoon
	  baking him this cake.
	   [a pink messy cake reading "Welcome Homer"]
Smithers: Mmm... [tastes the cake] Ugh!
   Burns: I pickled the figs myself.
-- Looks deceive, 

Meanwhile, the family is at Krusty Burger, alone, while the acne-
faced boy mops the floor.

  Boy: [mopping] Hey, did you guys just come from the prom?
 Bart: Sort of.
Marge: But, you know, we realized we're more comfortable in a place
       like this.
  Boy: [nods, then realizes] Man, you're crazy.  This place is a dump!
-- If only they knew about the secret sauce,
     

The boy continues mopping, muttering to himself, while an overhead
shot of the Simpsons at their table closes the episode.

 EPISODE TITLE: Bart the Fink


EPISODE SUMMARY:  {jl}

At the law firm of Dewey, Cheatham, Howe, and Weissman, an executor
and the Simpsons are seated.

Executor: May I offer my condolences on the untimely passing of your
          Great Aunt Hortense.  As her only living heirs, you stand to
          inherit her entire estate.
   Homer: [crying] Poor Aunt Hortense! [crying]
           [weakly] Woo-hoo.
          [crying] [weakly] Woo-hoo.
Executor: The only stipulation is that you spend one night in a haunted
          house.
   Marge: Isn't that somewhat unusual?
Executor: No, it's a standard clause.
-- Section 2, Paragraph 3, Clause 5, 

But Homer isn't worried, because there's no such thing as ghosts.
The family drives up to a particularly large and scary-looking house
right out of Psycho, in a lightning storm at that.  But Homer is
still confident: "Yes, there's no such thing as ghosts."  All seems
lost, but then a sweet, blissful morning comes around.

   Homer: Best night's sleep I ever had.
    Lisa: Their tap water tasted better than ours.
-- The Simpsons spend the night in a haunted house, 

The executor gives them each $100 (except Maggie), and the rest goes
to Ann Landers, as was stipulated in Hortense's will.  The family
look puzzled, and the executor realizes he must have kept on talking
after OFF left, and walks away laughing maniacally.

The family drive away from the "haunted" house.

Marge: What are you gonna spend your money on, kids?
 Bart: There's a special down at the Tacomat: a hundred tacos for a
       hundred dollars.  I'm gonna get that.
 Lisa: I'm going to contribute _my_ money to the Corporation for
       Public Broadcasting.
Marge: Tacos?  Public broadcasting?
-- Regretting your $30 contributon, eh?, 

Marge wants the kids to put their money in the bank.  When they get
there, Bart spots the Tacomat and wishes he could get those hundred
tacos.  The comic book guy comes out with a wheelbarrow full of tacos
for the "Dr. Who" marathon.

At the bank...

Marge: You'll feel better knowing your money's in the hands of
       professionals.
Clerk: [in an ape mask] Uk, uk, are you folks ready to go ape?
 Lisa: Mom...
Marge: A professional in an ape mask is still a professional.
-- At the First Tarzan Bank (of Springfield), 

Bart talks to the man in charge of new accounts.

 Man: ... and you'll find that saving for your future is far more
      thrilling than any roller coaster.
Bart: Really?  Wow, I should have started a long time ago!
 Man: Mm-hmm.  Now sign these forms.  I'm sure you'll find them more
      interesting than a weekend with Batman.
-- Batbart signs Batforms, 

Later, in the car, Lisa tells Bart she got the new Thrifty Savers
Savings Account.  A year from now, she'll have an extra nickel.  Bart
got a checking account with free customized checks, choosing the "Oh
the Humanity" check design.  Marge worries that Bart will not be able
to handle it, but he thinks he can.  Then he gives Lisa a check for
one cent.

At school...

Milhouse: A million dollars?  Gee, thanks Bart, I owe you one.
    Bart: That's a postdated check, remember.  Don't cash it 'til; the
          year 10,000
Milhouse: Okay.
           [checks his watch]
-- By then you might _be_ an ape, 

Bart gives Jimbo a check for a dollar, since Jimbo's holding him
upside down.  Jimbo promises to let Bart go when the check clears,
and drags him along the ground.

Bart wants to get Krusty's autograph, but...

That's it, no more autographs.  They're naming a burger after me at the
new restaurant.
-- Krusty, 

Milhouse got Krusty's autograph on his chest, and offers to press
bellies before the ink dries.  But Bart has a better idea: slips a
quarter's worth check into Krusty's pocket.  "If he wants this
twenty-five cents, he'll have to endorse the check by signing his
name on the back.  Then, when I get my monthly bank statement, I'll
get the check back complete with autograph.  No fuss, no muss..."
Milhouse thinks it's a good plan, but it won't impress girls.  He
demonstrates by baring his belly to a bunch of girls, who are
revolted.  Milhouse then laughs like an idiot.

A month later, Bart gets Lisa's signature, Apu's (?), and Jimbo's
(whose real name is Corky).  But Krusty's stamped his check with
a Cayman Islands Off-Shore Holding Corporation stamp.  Bart is
enraged, and takes it back to the bank so that they can make him sign
it.  The clerk assures Bart that's it's perfectly legal, but there
seemed to be a tipoff (can anything be more suspicious than the
Caymans?) and, in the course of five minutes, Krusty gets arrested
for tax fraud.  

                     [on phone]
Cayman Islands guy: [laughs] I'm sorry, but I cannot divulge
                    information about that customer's secret illegal
                    account.
                     [hangs up]
                    Oh, crap.  I shouldn't have said he was a customer.
                    Oh, crap.  I shouldn't have said it was a secret.
                    Oh, crap!  I certainly shouldn't have said it was
                    illegal.
                     [sighs] It's too hot today.
-- Who cares?, 

But it takes until 5:00 for Bart to find out:

Clerk: Sorry, the bank is-- oh, kid.  Gosh, I'm sorry, I meant to
       tell you -- turns out Krusty is one of the biggest tax cheats in
       history, and they nailed him, all thanks to you.  Some might say
       you're a hero, kid.
       Not me, however, I love Krusty.
 Bart: Ohh...
-- 

[End of Act One.  Time: 5'36"]

Kent Brockman reports about Krusty's tax "avoision" (with a little
argument with his staff) and mentions that it would have never come
to light if it weren't for Bart.

Bart: Krusty's my hero.  How could I do this to him?
Lisa: It's a tragedy for all us kids, but Bart, you can't beat yourself
      up.
Bart: Yeah.  There'll be plenty of people to do that for me at recess
      tomorrow.
-- Krusty's tax avoision comes to light, 

At the IRS Plaza...

Krusty: I can't go to jail!!  I got a swanky lifestyle.  I'm used to
        the best.
 Man 1: Krusty, this is America.  We don't send our celebrities to
        jail.  We're just going to garnish your salary.
Krusty: You're going to GARNISH my CELERY?
 Man 1: Please, Krusty, no jokes!
Krusty: WHO'S JOKING?!  Oh, I don't understand what you're saying,
        it all sounds so crazy to me.
-- Boo yourself, 

 Man 2: It simply means we'll be taking a small portion of your salary
        until your debt is repaid.  Say, 75% for 40 years.
Krusty: But I don't plan to live that long.
 Man 1: All right.  Better make it 95%.
Krusty: Ah!  Oh!  Oy...
-- I may or may not die young, 

The IRS present Krusty's new clown-related entertainment show, with
no sets, props, costumes, or Sideshow Mel.  It's pretty much a
disaster.

Krusty Burger is now IRS Burger, and Homer orders lunch...

Homer: Lesse, I'll have four tax burgers, one IRS-wich, withhold the
       lettuce, four dependent-sized sodas, and a FICA-ccino.
  Kid: Fill out schedule B.  You should receive your burgers in six
       to eight weeks.
-- At the new IRS Burger, 

Homer does a little math and works in Marge's $700 gambling losses.
Krusty laments his fate after getting off a bus...

They took my money.  They wrecked my show, they buried a bunch of
stinking veterans in my family plot.  But at least I got my memories.
Those are locked up safe in my fabulous mansion.
-- Krusty, 

But his mansion is being foreclosed, for cheap prices.  Krusty loses
a handmade leather suitcase (to Patty and Selma)...

My Grandpa Zev would turn over in his grave if it wasn't filled with
some veteran.
-- Krusty when his mansion is foreclosed, 

... his pornography (to a bidder in Japan, beating out Jasper)...

    Krusty: Oh, my beloved pornography!  I can't watch this anymore.
            I'm going to bed.
Auctioneer: How much for Krusty's bed?
       Moe: Half a buck.
Auctioneer: Sold!
       Moe: Good night everybody!
 Everybody: Good night Moe!
-- Krusty's mansion is foreclosed, 

... and his private plane, I'm-on-a-rolla-Gay.

Krusty: But I love that plane!  I used to fly to Vegas in it with
        Dean Martin.  One time we were flyin' in it, and the moon hit
        his eye like a big pizza pie!  We wrote a song about it!
        But it ended up infringing on one he recorded years before.
-- That's Enole'?, 

Patty: Hey, Selma.  That plane would go great with your suitcase.
Selma: Nah.  I just bought it to soak my feet in.
        [which she is doing right now]
       Ohh, ohhh...
-- Krusty's mansion is foreclosed, 

The auction is complete, and Krusty sits by the curb.  Bart comes
by and asks if he can sit down.

  Bart: I'm sorry for all the trouble I've caused you, Krusty, but you
        know, my mom says God never closes a door without opening a
        window.
Krusty: No offense, kid, but your mom's a dingbat!  There's no silver
        lining here.  I was a big cheese.  A _huge_ cheese!  And now
        look at me!
        I got to ride the bus like a schnook.
        I got to live in an apartment like an idiot!
        I have to wait in line with a bunch of nobodies to buy
        groceries from a failure!
  Bart: It doesn't matter what you did wrong, though, as long as you're
        on TV people will respect you.
Krusty: [spits] Bah.  What good is respect without the moolah to back
        it up.  Everywhere I go I see teachers driving Ferraris,
        research scientists drinking champagne.
        I tried to drink a Coke on the bus, and they took away my
        pass!
         [breaks a bottle of scotch]
        That's no life for a famous clown.
-- Ask Willie Nelson or Leona Helmsley, 

Bart tells Krusty he can punch him in the face if it'll make him feel
better, and Krusty considers it, but instead tells Bart to go home.

At the Kwik-E-Mart, Apu and Sanjay come out to some buzzing noise.

Shiva H. Vishnu!
-- Apu's expletive, 

They see Krusty bawling like a baby in his plane, waving goodbye.
Chalmers and Mrs. Skinner walk up to a house.

Chalmers: I must say I've had a lovely evening, Agnes.  I don't suppose
          I could come in for a cup of...
           [Skinner opens the door and turns on the light]
   Agnes: Seymour!
 Skinner: Mother! [gasps] Superintendent Chalmers!
Chalmers: Skinner!
 Skinner: What I wouldn't give for something to interrupt this awkward
          moment.
           [Krusty flies by bawling]
          That'll do nicely.
-- 

The Simpsons come out of hiding to watch Krusty.

 Lisa: You gotta hand it to Krusty.  
Homer: Yeah.  Even with all his problems, he's still willing to do
       something unbelievably dangerous just to entertain his fans.
  All: Wow.
 Bart: Yeah, that's my Krusty.  I got a feeling he'll be all right.
        [Krusty crashes into a mountain]
-- I said ha-ha, 

Everyone stands around the site of the crash, where Krusty's shoes
fall down.  Chief Wiggum invites everyone to get a load of the
wreckage, until he spots the tail wing with Krusty's face on it.

Ladies and gentlemen... Krusty the Clown... is dead.
-- Chief Wiggum, 

[End of Act Two.  Time: 12'11"]

The Simpsons, among many other celebrity guests, have come to the
funeral.

 Bart: I can't believe Krusty is really gone.
Homer: Don't worry, son.  I'm sure he's in heaven right now laughing it
       up with the other celebrities.  John Dillinger, Ty Cobb, Josef
       Stalin...
        [sighs]
       I wish I were dead.
-- Give me your money, your baseball, and your life, 

We are gathered here today to mourn the passing of Herschel Shmoikel
Krustofsky, beloved entertainer and dear friend... [perking up]
Hi, I'm Troy McClure!  You may remember me from other show business
funerals such as "Andre the Giant: We Hardly Knew Ye", and "Shemp
Howard: Today We Mourn a Stooge"!
-- Troy McClure at the funeral, 

Troy introduces his first speaker, Sideshow Mel.

I'm going to miss you, Krusty.  Me and all the other Sideshows...
except Sideshow Bob.
-- Melvin van Horne at Krusty's funeral, 

In the midst of our sorrow, we can take solace in the fact that your
elevated blood alcohol level probably helped you burn up quicker.
-- Melvin van Horne at Krusty's funeral, 

Sideshow Mel unveils a simple memorial to Krusty.  Troy introduces
Bob Newhart, who mutters his way through a speech.  Homer sheds
a tear.

Well, that's the funeral, folks.  We'll be sitting shivah at the
friar's club at 7:00 and again at 10.  You must be over 18 for the
10:00.  It gets a little blue.
-- Troy McClure closes Krusty's funeral, 

Bart watches the news at home where Kent Brockman reports on the
unveiling of the new Krusty stamp, where people were asked to vote
on two different signs: one of his heartwarming smile, or of his
fiery death.  They picked the first one.

Bart repeatedly pulls a string on a Krusty doll, which nets him
repeated groans from Krusty.  (Eww...) Homer tries to console him.

Homer: Don't let Krusty's death get you down, boy.  People die all the
       time, just like that. [snap] Why, you could wake up dead
       tomorrow.
        [pause]
       Well, goodnight.
-- Aw, I messed up again, 

Bart, while walking, spots a pickup truck carrying nets, and someone
with a similar appearence to Krusty.  He runs home and talks to
Marge.

 Bart: Mom, I just saw Krusty!
Marge: Yes, dear, in your mind.
 Bart: No, on the street.
Marge: On the street in your mind.
 Bart: Why won't you believe me?
Marge: Sweetheart, sometimes when people die, you just want them to
       be alive so badly you see them everywhere.  I went through the
       same thing when Lyndon Johnson died.
-- Who the hell is Lyndon Johnson?, 

At the hospital, Bart sees the same man walk out of Dr. Hibbert's
office, with prescribed pills for queasiness.

      Bart: Dr. Hibbert, who was that man?
   Hibbert: [chuckles] Why, Bart, telling you that would violate the
            patient-doctor privilege, just as if I were to tell you
            that Jasper here has five seconds to live.
    Jasper: What did he say?
Mrs. Glick: He said I'm next!
-- Jasper Moleman?, 

Bart spots the same man scuba diving for lobsters.  He talks to Lisa
about it.

Lisa: Bart, you're seeing Krusty everywhere because you want to tell
      him you're sorry for causing his death.  Would it help if I told
      you you're not responsible for Krusty's death.
Bart: Yes.  Yes, it would.
Lisa: Well, I can't.  You'll just have to learn to live with your
      mental problem.
-- Heartless Lisa, 

Bart, however, deduces that if he saw Krusty carrying nets, motion
sickness pills, and scuba diving, it can only lead to one thing.
He and Lisa head for the docks.

McAllister: Arr, I've got some customers.  Call me back, Ishmael.
-- 

Bart blows up a balloon of Krusty and asks "Have you seen this man?"
McAllister recognizes it as Handsome Pete who dances for nickels.
A short guy with a Krusty-like face comes in and plays "Sailor's
Hornpipe".  But Lisa says, "No, we're looking for this man: Krusty
the Klown."  "Narr, narr, narr," McAllister responds.

It's no use, Bart.  We've looked up and down these docks, from Pier One
to that Pier One by Pier 17.
-- Lisa, on the search for Krusty, 

But Bart spots something: a bounced check from a man with the exact
same signature as Krusty, Rory B. Bellows, slip eight.  Bart gives
Handsome Pete a quarter.  McAllister responds "Arr, not a quarter!
He'll be dancin' for hours."  Bart and Lisa run to slip eight.

Lisa: Are you Rory B. Bellows?
Rory: Yes.
Bart: How about Krusty the Klown?
Rory: Sorry, I don't do impressions.
Bart: Well, if you're not Krusty, how come you have the exact same
      signature as him?
Rory: I'm Rory Bellows, I tell you!  And I got some real corroborating
      evidence, over here, by the throttle!
       [turns the ship up to full throttle and tries to get away,
       but his ship is still tied to the dock]
      You know, you kids coulda said something instead of letting me
      make an ass of myself.
-- You don't need _us_ to do that, 

Rory has a pacemaker scar and a third nipple just like Krusty.  He
says he is Krusty, but he doesn't want to be anymore, and that's
why he faked his death.  Krusty bailed out just before the plane
crashed and jumped into a carefully placed net (well, he hit the
wall first).

Bart: Well, now that we've blown your cover, I guess you gotta come
      back and do your show again!
Lisa: Or kill us...
       [they both nervously giggle]
-- Way to go Lise, 

Krusty: I won't be coming back, kids.  I got a sweet life here.  The
        sea air is cleaning my lungs.  The sun is toasting my pale skin
        a healthy brown, and most important, I learned that I don't
        need money to be happy.  All that high living just distracted
        me from my true calling in life: salvaging sunken barges for
        scrap iron.  Sorry, kids, there's nothing left for me on dry
        land anymore.
  Bart: But, Krusty, what about all the kids who depend on you to
        brighten up their afternoon.  Are you gonna turn your back on
        them?
Krusty: Yes!
-- Good answer, 

Krusty sails off, but Bart and Lisa follow him, saying a bunch of
stuff to make him covet his old life.  When he sails away, Bart and
Lisa call after him.

         [Krusty sails out of view]
  Lisa: What about the great feeling you get from knowing you're better
        than regular people?
  Bart: What about being an illiterate clown who's still more respected
        than all the educators in the country put together!
         [Krusty throws down his anchor]
Krusty: Yeah!  I'm not gonna let those guys hog all the respect while
        I'm out here in this stinking tub.
         [dives into the water and swims to shore]
        That's just what those eggheads want!  Well, forget it
        poindexter, 'cause Krusty's back in town!
   B+L: Yay!
-- Forget those PC thugs, 

Krusty shakes off his yellow paint, fake beard, and fake nose (looks
like his real nose is red), then puffs back out his hair.  He, Bart,
and Lisa walk off together.

  Bart: So, Krusty, what are you gonna do about your tax problems?
Krusty: Don't sweat it.  The life of Rory B. Bellows is insured for a
        surprisingly large amount.
         [far off, Rory's boathouse blows up]
 B+L+K: [laugh]
-- Rory B. Bellows: We Are Richer For Having Lost Him, 

Bart and Lisa laugh while the credits show up, and Krusty lets slip
one of his goofy laughs.

 EPISODE TITLE: Lisa the Iconoclast


EPISODE SUMMARY: 

Many of the class is assembled to watch a film, "Young Jebediah
Springfield".

I hope they show the time where they traded guns to the Indians for
corn, and then the Indians shot them and took the corn.
-- Bart watches "Young Jebediah Springfield", 

The film is cheaply made.  After a "fight" with a "land cow",
Jebediah is asked by a boy how he can hope to achieve such
greatness.

 Jebediah: [on film] A noble spirit embiggens the smallest man.
     Edna: Embiggens?  I never heard that word before I moved to
	   Springfield
Ms.Hoover: I don't know why.  It's a perfectly cromulent word.
-- Nice supercalifragilisticexpialidocious word, 

Skinner addresses the class after the film is over.

Skinner: Now, as you all know, Springfield's 200th birthday is only a
	 week away.  Every class will do its part to make our local
	 bicentennial just as memorable as our national bicentennial.
	 Of course, you children are too young to remember that, with
	 the possible exception of Kearney.
Kearney: [shaving] Those tall ships really lifted the nation's spirits
	 after Watergate.
-- Quit bugging me about that stupid pirate, 

Ms. Hoover tells the class that they are to do reports on Jebediah 
and the top 18 essays will be put on file in the library.  Ralph asks
if they can put pictures in it.  At home, Homer reads the news, and
sees jobs available for the parade.  He wonders if he'll be a water
churner, typhoid carrier, or an apprentice.

 Lisa: How about town crier?  You'd be great at that.
Homer: You think so?
 Bart: Well, yeah, Dad, you're a big fat loudmouth and you can walk
       when you have to.
-- Homer during the 200th anniversary of Springfield,
     

Homer decides he'll do it.  Later, Lisa bikes to the Springfield
Historical Society and checks out a little mechanized thing about
river crossing.

Dangerous river crossings threatened life and limb but helped our
founding fathers save on bridge tolls.
-- Voiceover on a mechanized act of the founding of Springfield,
     

The voice turns out to be the curator, Hollis Hurlbut, talking into
a coffee mug.

Hurlbut: Sorry if I startled you, but I do love to talk Jebediah, even
	 when I'm drinking my chicory.
   Lisa: Hi, I'm Lisa Simpson.  I'm researching a report on Jebediah.
Hurlbut: Oh, you're in for a treat.  You know, some historians consider
	Jebediah a minor patriot, but I think you'll find he's easily
	the equal of William Dawes or even Samuel Otis.
-- Come again?, 

Meanwhile, Homer runs ahead in line to audition for the town crier,
but finds out Ned got the role.  Ned tries a pretty bad rendition.

  Homer: You su-diddely-uck, Flanders! [grabs a bell from him]
	 Hear ye, hear ye!  Ye olde town crier proclaimed crappy by 
	 all!  Chooseth Homer Simpson, and he shalt rock thy world!
 Wiggum: Good God, he is fabulous.
Skinner: Yes, he's embiggened that role with his cromulent performance.
 Quimby: Top-notch criering, I admit, but the hat and bell belong to
	 Ned Flanders, so no dice.
    Ned: Oh, they're just family heirlooms.  They shouldn't stand in
	 the way of Homer taking my job.
  Homer: Less chat, more hat.
	  [Ned hands it over.  Homer puts it on and it rips]
	 Woo-hoo!  Hear ye, hear ye!  The Homer Broadcasting System is
	 on the air!  All hollering, all the time!  I'm going to--
	  [Quimby stops him]
 Quimby: You're going to restrict your criering to the parade and
	 selected pre-approved publicity events!
  Homer: [meek] Okay.
-- Auditions for the part of town crier, 

Mr. Hurlbut continues to show Lisa around.

This case holds our most treasured exhibit: objects owned and used by
Jebediah [Springfield].
 This is his fife, upon which he sounded the sweet note of freedom.
 And his hatchet, with which he hacked at the chains of oppresions.
 And his -- chamber pot.
-- Hollis Hurlbut, curator of Springfield Historical Society,
     

Mr. Hurlbut hears a ding.  "Excuse me, my microwave jonnycakes are
ready."  And leaves.  Lisa tries on a coonskin hat, and tries to
sound a note on the fife.  But she succeeds only in blowing something
out of the fife.  It's Jebediah's secret confessions.

Know ye who read this there is more to my life than history records.
Firstly, I did not tame the legendary buffalo.  It was already tame, I
merely shot it.  Secondly, I have not always been known as Jebediah
Springfield.  Until 1796, I was Hans Sprungfeld, murderous pirate, and
the half-wits of this town shall never learn the truth!  Ha-ha-ha-ha-
ha!  Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!  Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! 
I write this confession so that my infamy will live on after my body
has succumbed to my infectious diphtheria.
-- The Secret Confession of Jebediah Springfield, 

Upon hearing this last bit, Lisa tries to get the diphtheria germs
off her body.

[End of Act One.  Time: 6'08"]

Lisa remains dumbfounded until Mr. Hurlbut returns.

Hurlbut: Heere's jonnycakes.  Is everything okay?  You look a bit
	 flushed.
   Lisa: It's just the excitement from studying Jebediah.
Hurlbut: Looks like you've come down with a serious case of Jebeditis.
   Lisa: Just as I was getting over my Chester A. Arthritis.
Hurlbut: [laughs] You had arthritis?
   Lisa: [chuckles nervously] No.
-- Lisa discovers Jebediah's confessions, 

Homer gets into his role of town crier the next morning.

Homer: [ringing bell] Hear ye, hear ye!  What's for breakfast!
Marge: Toast.
Homer: I don't understand thee, Marge.
Marge: [sighs] Ye olde toast.
Homer: Ooh.
-- Homer gets his role as town crier, 

Lisa tells Homer the story of Jebediah/Hans.

 Lisa: Jebediah Springfield was really a vicious pirate named Hans
       Sprungfeld.  His tongue was bitten off by a Turk in a grog house
       fight.
Homer: No tongue, eh?  How did he talk and eat [melodramatically] and
       laugh and love?
 Lisa: He had it replaced with a prosthetic tongue made out of silver.
Homer: Yes, that'll do.
-- 

Lisa tells the story of how Jebediah tried to kill George Washington.
And earns a reprimand from Marge.  But Homer reassures Lisa that he
believes her.

In class...

Hoover: Ralph, A.  Janey, A.  And Lisa, for your, ahem, essay "Jebediah
	Springfield: Super Fraud", F.
  Lisa: But it's all true.
Hoover: [scoffs] This is nothing but dead, white male-bashing from a PC
	thug.  It's women like you that keep the rest of us from 
	landing a husband.
-- Ralph got an A?, 

Lisa comes home sobbing, and tells Homer that she got an F.  Homer
decides to go and wreck the school with a baseball bat.  But Lisa
would rather get the confession.  Homer sticks with the bat idea,
though.

At the historical society, Homer and Lisa go after Jebediah's fife.
Mr. Hurlbut scans it briefly and dismisses it.

Hurlbut: I think, Lisa, that you've been taken in by an obvious
	 forgery.  Unfortunately, historical research is plagued by
	 this sort of hoax -- the so-called confession.  It's just
	 as fake as the Howard Hughes will, the Hitler Diaries, or the
	 Emancipation Retraction.
   Lisa: But it explains why there's no record of Jebediah Springfield
	 before 1796.  He was Hans Sprungfeld until then.
Hurlbut: That's preposterous.  Get out!  You're banned from this
	 historical society!  You, and your children, and your
	 children's children -- for three months.
-- 

Lisa decides to make posters about the fact that Jebediah is a fraud.

 Lisa: Okay, I'd like 25 copies in canary, 25 in goldenrod, 25 in
       saffron, and 25 in paella.
Clerk: OK, 100 yellow.
-- At a copy center, 

Comic book guy: Question: is your name Ridley Scott or James Cameron?
	 Homer: No, it's Homer.
Comic book guy: Then I would thank you to stop peering at my
		screenplay, _Homer_.  And if I see a movie where
		computers threaten our personal liberties, I will know
		you have stolen my idea.
	 Homer: But I'm just waiting for my kid.
		[thinking] Mental note -- steal his idea.
-- At a copy center, 

Lisa tries posting them in the Kwik-E-Mart.

Lisa: Hi, Apu.  Can I put these posters up in your window?
 Apu: Well, of course you can, you little pixy.  You are just as sweet
      as the stix which bear your name.
       [Apu sees the poster]
      No, no, no.  Take that down.  As a semi-legal immigrant, your
      poster could land me in a predicament as red-hot as the candies
      which bear that name.
-- Lisa posts signs of Jebediah the fraud, 

Lisa tries Moe's Tavern, with the help of her dad.

 Homer: Hear ye, hear ye.  My daughter has something to say about
	Jebediah Springfield.
   Moe: Aw, look.  That cutie wants to say something cute.
	 [barflies murmur]
	Shut up, you bums, shut up! 
	Go ahead, angel.
  Lisa: Ahem.  Jebediah Springfield was nothing more than a murderous
	pirate who hated this town!
	 [barflies and Moe's jaws drop]
   Moe: Good God!  Homer, I support, you know, any prejudice you can
	name, but this hero-phobia sickens me.  All right, you and your
	daughter ain't welcome here no more.  Barney, show them the
	exit.
Barney: There's an exit?!
-- Thought it was a portal of natural light, 

Moe snitches on the town jubilation committee, who place Homer and
Lisa under questioning.

Quimby: You are tampering with forces you cannot understand.  We have
	major corporations sponsoring this event.
  Lisa: I hope you know you're sponsoring a celebration of a murderous
	pirate.
   Man: A pirate?  Well, that's hardly the image we want for Long John
	Silver's!
-- Respectable ship hijackers, 

Lisa suggests digging up Jebediah's grave and searching his body
for the silver tongue.

Can't we have one meeting that doesn't end with us digging up a corpse?
-- Mayor "Diamond" Joe Quimby, 

Groundskeeper Willie exhumes Jebediah's body, and Mr. Hurlbut opens
the coffin with a crowbar.  When it opens, everyone gasps in
amazement...

[End of Act Two.  Time: 14'09"]

 Wiggum: Oh my God!  Jebediah's body has been replaced with a skeleton!
Hurlbut: No, that's the skeletion _of_ Jebediah.
-- Jebediah Springfield's body is exhumed, 

Lisa suggests looking in his shoes, but Wiggum sticks to looking in
the skull.  There is no silver tongue.

Wiggum: Well, that settles it.  There is no silver tongue... is there,
	bonesy?
	 [takes Jebediah's skull and uses it as a dummy]
	[as skull] Oh, I wish chief.  With that kind of dough, I could
	buy me some eyeballs!  [laughs]
	That's the spirit, bonesy.  Why don't you sing a song for
	the nice people?
	[as skull] Okay!  Camptown ladies sing this song, doo-dah
	doo-dah, Camptown races five miles long...
-- Jebediah Springfield's body is exhumed, 

Chief Wiggum blames the mess on Homer and Quimby strips him of the
role of town crier.  At home, Homer uses a clock as a substitute.
Lisa and Homer exchange apologies.

Lisa dreams of Jebediah chastising him, but George Washington tosses
him out the window, and urges Lisa to keep on going.  "There's only
one piece left in the puzzle."  Lisa doesn't want to continue...

We had quitters in the Revolution, too.  We called them Kentuckians!
-- George Washington (in Lisa's dream), 

Washington: Looks like I'm going to have to find another little girl
	    to be President.  What's your friend Janey's number?
      Lisa: No, not Janey!   She'll pack the Supreme Court with _boys_!
-- Big change, 

Washington's visage fades away.  Lisa talks in her sleep, "I want
to help you, George Washington..."

"I want to help you, George Washington"?  Pfft, even your dreams are
square.
-- Bart to Lisa, 

At school, milk and cookies are handed out...

 Ralph: Can you open my milk, mommy?
Hoover: I'm not mommy, Ralph.  I'm Miss Hoover.
-- 

Everyone is right to laugh at Ralph, and do, except Lisa, who stares
at the incomplete portrait of George Washington and realizes the
answer.  She runs to the historical society and Mr. Hurlbut protests,
but Lisa has deduced that Mr. Hurlbut stole the silver tongue.
After a while, he confesses.  Then Lisa tells her part of the story:
the paper the confession is written on is the bottom half of the
portrait of George Washington.  After the fight, that piece stuck on
Hans' shoe.  Mr. Hurlbut and Lisa decide to stop the celebration,
but Lisa cannot.  She succumbs, and tells Mr. Hurlbut that the myth
of Jebediah has brought out the good in everyone.

Homer looks at Ned with scorn as he takes on his role as town crier.
Finally, he has enough and confronts him mid-cry...

   Ned: Well, hey, it's Homer.  Good to see you, neigh--
	 [Homer pushes him and takes his bell]
 Homer: Get lost!
	 [rings the bell]
	Hear ye, hear ye, hear ye!
 Helen: He is not the official town crier!  Police, do something!
Wiggum: Well, I'd like to, ma'am, but he's too damn good!
	Let him march, boys.  Let the man march!
-- Homer replaces Ned as the town crier, 

Lisa runs up to her father, who holds the bell in his teeth tempor-
arily to grab Lisa up on piggyback.  He hands Lisa the bell and Lisa
rings the bell, and they march through the parade.

[End of Act Three.  Time: 21'25"]

The credits are superimposed over a shot of the bottom of Jebediah's
statue: "A noble spirit embiggens the smallest man."  Pan up to
Jebediah as an old west tune plays:

	Hitch that team up, Jebediah Springfield
	Whip them horses, let them wagons roll
	That a people might embiggen America
	That a man might embiggen his soul
	His soul
	His soul...

Gracie tune is unchanged.

 EPISODE TITLE: Homer the Smithers


EPISODE SUMMARY:  {fb}

It seems that Mr. Burns is holding yet another employees-wife-and-no-
more-than-three-children night, this time at the Springfield Dragway.

Smithers: [on mike] Testing, testing for Mr. Burns.
          [to Burns] Here you go, sir, I've warmed up the crowd for
          you.
   Burns: [in a wooden voice] Welcome employees. Come in!
           [Smithers holds him a card]
          The whole night's entertainment is on me.
           [takes another card] Monty Burns!
          [all cheer]
-- Burns' moving speech, 

Everybody takes their seats, Homer wearing a huge foam hat.

Announcer: Welcome, welcome, welcome to an evening of exciting
           quarter-mile action, action, action! Our first race is a
           benefit for daredevil Lance Murdoch, Murdoch, Murdoch, who's
           hospitalized with cirrhosis of the liver, liver, liver!
            [crowd cheers]
    Homer: All right! Liver!
-- Ask the connoisseur, 

Two hot rods take place on the starting line.  Marge admires the 
hot rods and asks the kids, "Boy, it sure would be fun to car-pool
in one of those, huh kids?  I'd be a real hot rod mama, wouldn't I?
Huh?"  Bart responds with "You missed the race, mama."  Marge watches
the cars cross the finish line. "Mmm, I wish I'd pay more attention."

Meanwhile, Smithers is giving Burns a teaspoon of Duff.

   Burns: Smithers, this beer isn't working. I don't feel any younger
          or funkier.
Smithers: I'll switch to the tablespoon, sir.
-- As long as the bubbles don't burn your tongue, 

Announcer: Coming up next, our feature race: the Nuclear Power Plant
           Championship. Plant plant!
    Burns: Ah, at last. Smithers, fetch the bi-oculars.
            [watches the 2-second race]
    Burns: Oh, damnation, tell them to go slower!
 Smithers: Yes sir.
            [meets the drivers]
           Hi guys. Uh, can we keep it in first gear for a couple laps?
            [they take off again, at an awfully low speed]
    Burns: [excited] Go! Go!
           [mean] Slow down.
            [the two drivers reluctantly look at each other, but do so]
            [after crossing the line, they release their parachutes,
             which don't even open]
    Burns: Excellent.
-- After all, I paid for this, 

The night is over and everyone walks away. Smithers is about to drive
Burns home, but is asked to change his #1 "novelty foam hand" for a
smaller one, as it is "ludicrously oversized".


As Smithers goes away, Lenny happens to walk by and decides to thank
his boss.

   Lenny: [drunk] Eh, Burnsie. This was some swell shindig. Thank you
          very much!
   Burns: [frightened] Smithers, what's happening?
   Lenny: [even drunker] I had a great time. I just want to shake your
          hand.
           [Terrorized, Burns rolls up the window]
          [his face stuck on the window] You're the greatest!
   Burns: Smithers, help!
-- The dangers of holding employees nights, 

Smithers comes back to save Burns and escorts Lenny away, but cannot
prevent him from turning back and giving a thumbs up to his boss. A
frightening view.


Along on the road, Burns comes out from under the seat.

   Burns: You should've seen the murderous glint in his eyes, Smithers.
          And his breath reeked of beer and pretzeled bread.
Smithers: I'm so sorry, Mr. Burns. This was all my fault.
   Burns: Don't concern yourself. If things had turned ugly, I always
          had my mace.
Smithers: Don't let me off the hook that easily, sir. I failed you and
          I'll never forgive myself.
          [bangs his head on the steering wheel] Never, never, never...
           [Burns rolls up the window between himself and Smithers]
          [muffled] Never, never, never...
           [phone ringing]
          [on phone] Never, never, never!
-- Loyal and persistent, 

The next morning, at Burns' office.

Smithers: Good morning, sir! To make up for my failure last night, I
          alphabetized your breakfast; you can start with the waffles
          and work your way up to the zwieback. And, to prevent
          newsprint from rubbing off on your hands, I've laminated
          today's newspaper.
   Burns: I appreciate the thought, but my pen won't write on this. How
          am I supposed to do the Junior Jumble?
Smithers: Oh, I can't even grovel properly! I'm a buffoon! I don't
          deserve to live on your planet anymore!
-- By all means necessary, 

He swipes the head off the water fountain and proceeds to try to
drown himself. Fortunately for him, Burns drains all the water by
holding down the cold water button.

   Burns: Pull yourself together, man. I daresay you're in need of a
          long vacation.
Smithers: No! Don't make me take a vacation! Without you I'll wither
          and die!
   Burns: That's a risk I'm willing to take.
-- Nothing can stop him, 

Smithers: But what would you do without me, sir?
   Burns: Thuh! I'm not a baby who needs a nursemaid to burp me.
          [burps] You see?
-- You made your point, 

Burns: Now, I insist that you take a vacation, just as soon as a
       temporary substitute can be found.
        [leads Smithers to the door and closes it]
       [from behind the door] Sheesh.
-- Smithers is overworked, 

That night, Smithers stays late at his office, busy working on his
computer.

Smithers: I've got to find a replacement that won't outshine me.
          Perhaps if I searched the employee evaluations for the word
          [types] "Incompetent"...
           [computer reports: 714 matches found]
          714 names? Better be more specific. [keeps typing] "lazy",
          "clumsy", "dim-witted", "monstrously ugly"
           [computer searches, then reports: 714 matches found]
          Oh, nuts to this! I'll just go get Homer Simpson.
-- His reputation precedes him, 

At home, OFF is shoving down their food as usual...

I think Smithers picked _me_ because of my motivational skills.
Everyone always says they have to work a lot harder when I'm around.
-- Homer, Employee of the month, 

Lisa: You know Dad, assisting Mr. Burns could give your career a real
       shot in the arm.
Marge: [comes in, holding a bowl] You know Homer, assisting Mr. Burns
       could give your career a real shot in the arm.
 Lisa: Mom, I just said that.
Marge: [sarcastically] Soooorry! Next time get your own darn corn.
-- Broken Record time, 

The next day, at SNPP, Homer is getting used to Smithers' office.

   Homer: Um, is this the chair I'll be sitting on?
Smithers: Yeah.
           [Homer plays with the chair]
          Now, I realize caring for Mr. Burns seems like a big job,
          but... actually it's just 2,800 small jobs.
   Homer: Uh huh. But this _is_ the chair, right?
Smithers: Your new duties will include: answering Mr. Burns' phone,
          preparing his tax return, moistening his eyeballs, assisting
          with his chewing and swallowing, lying to Congress, and some
          light typing.
-- Typing? My whole plan down the--, 

The phone rings...

Smithers: [answering] Montgomery Burns' office. Oh, hello Mrs. Burns.
          I'll see if your son is available.
   Homer: Mr. Burns has a mother? She must a hundred million years old!
Smithers: She has limited capacities. All she can do is dial and yell.
-- Does she watch `Matlock'?, 

Smithers: I'm sorry, Monty can't come to the phone right now. He's in a
          very important meeting and can't be disturbed.
           [shot of Burns trying to avoid falling asleep]
-- A rested plant owner is a vigilant plant owner,           
          
Smithers: Mr. Burns can't stand talking to his mother. He never forgave
          her for having that affair with president Taft.
   Homer: [chuckles] Taft, you old dog.
-- 

Smithers is brushing Burns' teeth.

   Burns: [spits] Really Smithers, I'll be fine. I'm sure your
          replacement will be able to handle everything. Who is he,
          anyway?
Smithers: Uh, Homer Simpson, sir. One of your organ banks from sector
          7-G. All the recent events of your life have revolved around
          him in some way.
   Burns: Simpson, eh?
-- Rings a bell?, 

Smithers is packing his luggage in the airport van.

   Homer: [yelling from his window] Uh, Mr. Smithers? I don't
          understand 2,700 of my new duties.
Smithers: Well, the van's leaving; which one duty is giving you the
          most trouble?
   Homer: Um... what do I do in case of fire?
Smithers: [muffled from inside the van] Sorry, can't hear you. Bye!
           [the van leaves]
   Homer: [sits, then looks at Mr. Burns' office burning down]
          Aw, just my luck.
-- When the fire starts to burn..., 

[End of Act One.  Time: 6'19"]


Homer manages to get a hold on a fire extinguisher and put out the
fire.

Burns: [gasps at his sight] Good Lord, Smithers, you look atrocious. I
       thought I told you to take a vacation.
Homer: Uh, Smithers already left, sir. I'm his replacement, Homer
       Simpson.
Burns: Ah yes, Simpson.
-- Well, they both have four fingers, 

Burns: I'll have my lunch now. A single pillow of Shredded Wheat, some
       steamed toast, and a dodo egg.
Homer: But I think the dodo went extinct...
Burns: Get going! And answer those phones, install the computer system,
       and rotate my office so the window faces the hills.
Homer: [taking notes] Uh huh. Uh huh. Okay. Um, can you repeat the part
       of the stuff where you said all about the... things. Uh... the
       things?
        [Burns looks at him meanly]
-- Efficiency at its best, 

Next morning, Homer wakes up at 4:30, and tries to put on his pants.
Fitting his left leg into the pants' right leg poses no problem, but
the absence of any possible way of reaching his goal from this very
situation engenders a paradox too complex for his neural activity at
this hour.

Lousy two-legged pants.
-- Homer's deep reflexions at 4:30, 

Marge: Homie, it's 4:30 in the morning. Little Rascals isn't until 6.
Homer: I know, I'm taping it. I want to get to Burns' house bright and 
       early to make his breakfast.
Marge: Hmm, poor Homie. Poor, poor... [snores]
-- How compassionate, 

Homer walks in Burns' kitchen, and is lost by the diversity and
complexity of all the equipment. "Hmm... one of these must be a
breakfast maker," he wonders. Homer gets into the spirit: "Well, it's
my job to cook him breakfast, and I'm gonna cook the best damn
breakfast he ever ate." He tries to cook a shish kebab on the burner,
but is puzzled when the whole thing ends up in flames. As his next
attempt, he breaks the window of the microwave door, and inserts
another shish kebab. The waves going through his arm don't seem to
affect him, but this time it's the microwave which is burning. As a
last resort, he pours some Corn Flakes and milk in a bowl, and gets
annoyed when this breakfast ends up in the same way as his previous
attempts.


He finally comes up with a solution.

Doughnuts? I told you I don't like ethnic food!
-- Mr. Burns, commenting on Homer's breakfast, 

Burns: Here, tell me how my stocks did yesterday.
Homer: Uh... they all won.
Burns: What about my options?
Homer: Well, you can either get up or go back to sleep.
Burns: I believe I'll get up.
-- Still needs to study `Advanced Marketing', 

Comes bath time...

Burns: Scrub harder. Got to get that layer of dead skin off.
Homer: [groans]
-- Burns' personal hygiene, 

Then it's denture-choosing time: "I think... the fangs today." Homer
inserts the fanged denture, and Burns' jaw hangs in the air until
Homer pushes it up.


Later that day...

Burns: [from his office] Simpson? Simpson?
        [walks into Smithers' office]
       Did you get that report on the accounting department?
Homer: Yes sir, I did.
       [reads] "The accounting department is located on the 3rd floor.
       Its hours are 9am to 5pm. The head of this department is a Mr.
       Johnson or Johnstone."
-- `My report', by Homer Simpson, 

Yet a little later...

Homer: Here are your messages:
       "You have 30 minutes to move your car",
       "You have 10 minutes",
       "Your car has been impounded",
       "Your car has been crushed into a cube",
       "You have 30 minutes to move your cube".
        [phone ringing]
Homer: [answers] Yello, Mr. Burns' office.
Burns: Is it about my cube?
-- More of a Frinkahedron, 

   Homer: It's Mr. Smithers, he's calling for you.
Smithers: [on a beach] How's everything going there, sir? Well, I have
          a lot of... free time on my hands. If you FedEx me your mail
          I'd be happy to open it and return it to you.
   Burns: Everything's fine, Smithers. But this Simpson fellow seems to
          be getting dumber by the minute, I've never seen anything
          quite like it. Anywho, you just enjoy your vacation.
   Homer: [moans]
-- Nothing like being appreciated at work, 

That night at home, Homer can't keep his eyes open.

Homer: [snores]
 Bart: Look alive, Simpson, I'm not paying you to goldbrick.
Homer: [wakes up] Uh... Yes sir.
 Bart: Now get cracking on my long division, and don't forget to show
       your work, Simpson.
Homer: I'll have it on your desk tomorrow morning, sir.
 Lisa: Bart, leave Simpson alone! [whispering to Homer] Simpson, I need
       a ride to the library.
Homer: Yes sir.
Marge: Kids, stop exploiting your father. Homie, why don't you lie down
       and relax?
Homer: No time, Marge. I thing Mr. Burns wants me to do some long
       division.
Marge: [authoritatively] Simpson, lie down!
        [Homer does so]
       Sorry, but you need a good night's rest.
-- More obedient than the dog, 

As Homer sighs in relief and enjoys his rest, a loud bell can be
heard, with Burns yelling "Simpson!".


Homer rushes in Burns' manor, where Burns is ringing a tiny bell in a
giant megaphone.

   Burns: The telephone has been ringing for some time.
          [severely] Answer it.
   Homer: [answers] Yello.
          [to Burns] It's for you.
Smithers: [on a public phone] Mr. Burns, 48 rings, are you all right?
          What did Simpson do to you?
   Burns: Nothing other than drive me to distraction with his
          incompetent boobery. Terrible at everything, a complete
          moron!
           [Homer is still holding the phone]
          But I'm not really free to talk right now.
          Look, stop calling me and enjoy your vacation. And remember,
          I want to see lots of pictures when you get back.
Smithers:  [obviously calling from a "men only" bar]
          Uh, actually sir, picture-taking is not allowed at this...
          particular resort.
           [a conga line of men forms behind him]
          Oop, I gotta go now, there's a line forming behind me.
           [joins in]
-- Nah, it can't be what it seems, 

Homer reluctantly walks into another typical day in the life of 
Burns' assistant.  Burns turns on his desk lamp and is blinded.
"60 watts! What do you think this is, a tanning salon?", he yells.

At night, in bed, Burns' nightcap is solidified into a cone, thanks 
to Homer forgetting to use light starch, and Burns yells while
poking Homer with it.

He just never can be satisfied...

Burns:  [throws his glass at Homer]
       You call this Postum?
        [bashes a 5-feet high pile of paper]
Burns: You call this a tax return?
        [bangs a CRAY with his cane]
Burns: You call this a supercomputer?
-- Our referee in the Win 95 vs. OS/2 struggle, 

Burns keeps yelling and throwing things at Homer, who can stands no
more; after a long yell of despair, he smashes his fist in Burns'
face, sending him to the floor. Realizing what he's done, he whimpers
in fear before he runs off home, shuts the door and sits against it.

Marge: Is there something wrong, Homie?
Homer: No.
Marge: Except?
Homer: Except... I killed Mr. Burns!
-- Just asking, 

 Lisa: What happened, Dad?
Homer: I punched Burns right in his 104-year-old face.
 Lisa: Are you sure he's dead? Maybe you just really really hurt him.
Marge: Okay, maybe everything's all right, maybe if you go apologize he
       won't even fire you. If he's alive.
-- That's what the `better hospitals' are for, 

Homer knocks on the door at Burns' office, but gets no response. It
seems to be empty, yet some rapsy breathing can be heard. After
looking around, Homer pokes behind a plant, and sees Burns hiding.
Both gasp at each other's sight.

Homer: I'm really sorry I hit you Mr. Burns. Here, let me put some salt
       on that eye.
Burns: [frightened] No, please, I can't bear another trashing. Just
       leave me be!
Homer: Yes sir...
        [walks away]
Burns: Must call Smithers, he'll protect me from this beast.
        [looks at his phone]
       I've seen people activate this machine a thousand times. Doesn't
       seem to be any trick to it. Let's see, Smithers...
       S-M-I-T-H-E-R-S. Success, it's ringing!
  Moe: Moe's tavern.
Burns: I'm looking for a Mr. Smithers, first name Waylon.
  Moe: Oh... So you're looking for a Mr. Smithers, eh? First name
       Waylon is it? Listen to me, you! When I catch you, I'm gonna
       pull out your eyes, and shove 'em down your pants, so you can
       watch kick the crap outta you, okay? Then I'm gonna use your
       tongue to paint my boat!
-- The hunter has become the hunted, 

Burns puts the receiver in a drawer, locks it, and sits back behind
the plant.  He bemoans his fate.  "Oh, Smithers, if you could only
hear me..."  Back at the resort, Smithers senses these words and
stops driving his boat, sending a pyramid of water-skiing men into
it.

Burns slides a mirror under the door to monitor the enemy...

Burns: Praise God. I think the thug has finally gone home for the day.
       Now, I can make my escape...
Homer: [shows into the mirror] Hi, Mr. Burns! You want your coffee now?
Burns: Uh, no. I'm making it myself!
        [takes a coffeepot, rattles it]
       Hear that? The percolations are imminent. No need to come in.
       Uh... cease your ingress!
-- Whatever that means it ain't good, 

Homer walks in later, to see Burns surrounded by coffee, sacks and
beans spilled almost everywhere.

Burns: Stay back Homer, approach no further, coffee's already made. I
       stomped the beans myself.
Homer: Uh, well, can I at least drive you home, Mr. Burns? It's 5:00.
Burns: No! I thought, uh, I thought I'd chauffeur myself this evening.
       Yes, that's what I thought. How difficult could it be? I'm sure
       the manual will indicate which lever is the velocitator and
       which the deceleratrix, hmm?
-- Yeah, somewhere on the back, 

Behind the steering wheel, Burns drives recklessly while slowly
learning that he enjoys doing things for himself, wrecking several
things and nearly crashing into Chief Wiggum, who congratulates Burns
on his reckless driving.

The next day at the office, it's a new Mr. Burns who shows up.

Homer: Would you like me to shred those environmental reports for you,
       sir?
Burns: Already taken care of.
        [shreds the reports and throw them out the window]
Burns: [chuckles] Capucino, Simpson?
        [phone ringing]
       [answers] Ahoy-hoy? No, you have the wrong number. This is
       4-2-*4*-6. I suspect you need more practice working your
       telephone machine. Not at all. Ahoy!
Homer: Uh, Mr. Burns, is there anything at all I can do for you?
Burns: No, Homer, you've already done more for me than any man. Your
       brutal attack forced me to fend for myself. I realize now that
       being waited on hand and foot is OK for your average Joe, but
       it's not for me.
-- But at least you can afford it, 

Smithers comes just in time to see Burns hugging and thanking Homer.

Smithers: Oh my God! I knew I shouldn't have left...
   Burns: Ah, welcome back Smithers. Say, do you know Homer Simpson, he
          pitched in around the office while you were away. Bang-up
          job, Simpson, but I guess it's back to your trusty post in
          sector 7-G.
Smithers: [sighs in relief] You heard the man, Simpson.
   Burns: Ah, and my dear dear Smithers. You're no longer needed at
          all.
          You're fired. Ta!
   Homer: [to Smithers] *You* shouldn't have gone away in vacation.
-- Then who'll release the hounds?, 

[End of Act Two.  Time: 15'41"]


At home, OFF is yet again chomping that so-called food of theirs.

Marge: Cheer up, Homie.
Homer: I just feel terrible about getting Mr. Smithers fired. That job
       was all he had. Imagine how _you'd_ feel Marge if you got fired
       from the... those... things that... you do.
Bart: Quick Mom, whip up a cake before Dad fires ya!
-- She can still take back her job at Mr. Burger, 

But Lisa comforts him: "Mr. Smithers is a resilient man, I'm sure he
can get a great job at any corporation he wants."


And indeed, he is about to enter the AT&amp;T office -- which reveals to
be NEAT &amp; TIDY: Piano Movers. "Meet your new piano mover" he says,
followed by his predictable visit to the hospital.  Hibbert tells
Smithers that he'll need a steel rod for a spine.

Next try is the Springfield Dragway.

Smithers: [on mike] Get ready for exciting quarter-mile action at the
          Springfield Dragway. It'll be motorized mayhem mayhem mayhem.
          [softly] Do we need all those "mayhems"? We do. All right,
          fair enough. I suppose you know your business.
          [loud] Get ready for fun, fun, fun!
          [soft] I... The people are already here, we don't... need to
          keep hustling them like this, do we?
          [angrily] Let go of me... Where are you throwing me?
           [trash noises]
-- You're fired, fired, fired!, 

And guess where he ends up?  At Moe's Tavern.

Smithers: Uh, hello. You got a "Help Wanted" sign on the window?
     Moe: Yeah, I need someone to help me with the midnight beer
          delivery. Your job is to distract Barney until it's safely
          off the truck.
Smithers: I'll just... wait out back until then.
  Barney: I look forward to working with you!
-- Does it takes credentials?, 

But Homer knows him better. "You can give up on yourself, and take
the Barney-guarding job like so many have contemplated in our darkest
moments, or you can admit to yourself there's only one person that
can make you happy and do whatever it takes to get them back."
Smithers admits he's right, but he's going to need Homer's help.
Their conversation is interrupted by the 12 strokes of midnight.
"Oh my God!" Moe yells, as the beer delivery truck is ransacked by
Barney.  Moe can't bear to watch.

At SNPP, Homer and Smithers are preparing their plan.  Smithers is
planning to make Burns talk to his mother, whom he hates, and when
she tears into him, Smithers will save the day.

So Smithers calls Mrs. Burns.

Mrs. Burns: [on phone] Whot?
  Smithers: Hello, Mrs. Burns? This is Waylon Smithers. I have your son
            Montgomery on the line...
Mrs. Burns: That improvident lackwit? Always too busy stridin' about
            his atom mill to call his own mother. I'll give him
            what-fors 'till he cries brassafrax!
-- We finally know where he gets it from, 

Smithers puts her on hold.

Smithers: [chuckles] Perfect. When I give the signal, you transfer the
          call to Mr. Burns. After she tears into him I'll rush in and
          save the day.
   Homer: Got it.
          [pushes Speaker] I'm transfering a call in to you, Mr. Burns.
   Burns: [on intercom] No problemo!
   Homer: [hesitating between the four buttons] Uh... Ooh... Uh...
           [pushes Disconnect]
          [hearing the dial tone] Oh oh.
   Burns: [from his office] Ahoy-hoy? Hoy?
   Homer: [in falsetto] Hello Mr. Burns? This is your mother.
Smithers: [whispering] No...
   Burns: Urg... Oh, hello mater. Um... sorry about pulling the plug on
          you and all, uh... who could've known you'll pull through
          and... live... for another 5 decades? Ohh, is my face red!
Smithers: [to Homer] Mrs. Burns is 122 years old, so try to sound more
          dessicated. And she doesn't call her son "Mr. Burns"!
   Homer: [cracking falsetto] Son, this is Mrs. Burns. I just called to
          say I don't love you. You are a bad son Montel...
   Burns: [behind him] So...
   Homer: [screams]
   Burns: Impersonate my mother, will you? And you Smithers, you must
          have put him up to it. I'm glad I fired you.
   Homer: Ya really blew it this time, Smithers.
-- I didn't do it, 

Smithers can't take it anymore; he jumps on Homer and the two of them
fight in Burns' office, choking each other.  "Stop that, stop that at
once, you're fighting!", Burns pleads.  But that won't stop them.
Homer delivers a punch to Smithers, who pulls on his hair strands in
return.  "Stop fighting like a girl, Simpson!" Smithers yells, and
Homer responds in kind by throwing a punch. Smithers counterattacks
with a punch aimed at Homer's stomach, but his fist is stuck in that
blob of fat. Homer takes the opportunity to taunt Smithers' head, but
shouts out a well-deserved "D'oh!" when his opponent bites him.


Burns tries to get their attention by blowing a paper bag, throwing a
glass of water on them, and poking them with a stick.  Smithers
"teaches" Homer how to use a phone by repeatedly slamming him with
the receiver. Frightened, Burns finds refuge on top of his stuffed
polar bear.


Homer runs towards Smithers shouting "I'll show you!", but Smithers
knows a few tricks: he opens Burns' safe and slams the door into
Homer's face. Stunned, he walks back and hits the bear, which falls
through the window and crashes into the ground, bringing Burns with
him.  "Oh my..." Smithers says.

That night, at his manor, Burns is resting at bed, wearing several
casts.

Smithers: [feeding him] Here comes the endangered condor into the power
          lines... I've got Bobo hot from the dryer. Careful not to burn
          yourself on his eye.
   Burns: I don't need you to do any of this. I'm totally self-reliant
          now. What I would like though is a Spanish peanut.
           [Smithers hands him one]
          Skin?
           [Smithers skins it and puts it in Burns' mouth]
   Burns: [chewing] It's a remarkable thing, in the short time you were
          gone, I learned to be completely self-reli...
           [Smithers feeds him another peanut]
          ...ant.
          Oh, and as for that brutish fellow who knocked me out the
          window, see that he gets what's coming to him.
Smithers: I already have, sir.
           [Homer and his family enjoy a huge "Thank You" basket]
    Bart: What did you get that for?
   Homer: For knocking Mr. Burns out of a 3rd story window.
    Bart: Makes sense to me.
    Lisa: Did he die?
   Homer: What am I, a doctor?
-- Looks like it's back to our wacky adventures,

 EPISODE TITLE: The Day the Violence Died


EPISODE SUMMARY:  {fb}

It's late at night, and the kids, appropriately equipped with cans of
Buzz Cola and their Itchy &amp; Scratchy anniversary caps, are watching
the 48-hour Itchy &amp; Scratchy Diamond Jubilee Marathon: "celebrating
75 years of rib-tickling brutality and hilarious atrocities".


Another Itchy &amp; Scratchy episode runs, called "Remembrance of Things
Slashed". The kids laugh heartily for a while, then get up and
stretch themselves.

Bart: Lisa, if I ever stop loving violence, I want you to shoot me.
Lisa: Will do.
-- Let someone who still loves it do it, 

Kent Brockman comes on the air.

Tonight, a stowaway bear is terrorizing space shuttle astronauts. But
first, a sneak peak at tomorrow's Itchy &amp; Scratchy parade.
-- Important news first, 

Bart and Lisa sit and watch, as Kent continues: "I'm here live on
Main Street where dedicated fans are already staking out the best
seats for the big anniversary parade."

The kids gasp, then run for the door.

Bart &amp; Lisa: Bye Mom! Bye Dad!
      Homer: Bye Kids! On your way back, pick up a six-pack of beer.
-- Homer J. Simpson cares for his family, 

Marge: Bart, Lisa, it's 11:00 at night. Where do you think you're
       going?
 Bart: Downtown.
 Lisa: We gotta get seats for the Itchy &amp; Scratchy parade.
Marge: I won't have my children sitting alone on a cold, dangerous
       street all night. Homer, you go too.
Homer: Ohh... Why can't they just take the gun?
-- Because they won't hire an assistant, 

Homer and the kids are sitting in garden chairs on Main Street's
sidewalk, and they are bored to death.

 Lisa: Hey, the comic book store is still open.
 Bart: Save our seats.
Homer: Will do.
	[a couple takes their place]
  Man: Hello.
Homer: [moans]
-- Better luck in 25 years, 

In the comic book store, the TV is showing an Itchy &amp; Scratchy
version which is obviously not meant for kids.

Hey, my threads, baby!
-- Scratchy in I&amp;S Meets Fritz the Cat, 

	  Bart: How come I've never seen that Itchy &amp; Scratchy before?
Comic Book Guy: Perhaps because you are prepubescent ignoramus. This is
		a bootleg copy of "Itchy &amp; Scratchy Meets Fritz the
		Cat". Because of its frank depiction of sex and
		narcotic consumption, it is not for infantile intellects
		such as yours. Now toodle-oo.
-- Bart finally learns something about I&amp;S, 

Walking away, Bart sees a lot of Itchy &amp; Scratchy merchandise. Among
the usual crap like dolls and lunch boxes, there is what seems to be
an antique drawing of Itchy.

	  Bart: Cool! I'll give you ten bucks for that.
Comic Book Guy: Are you the creator of Hi and Lois, because you are
		making me laugh. That drawing's worth exactly 750
		dollars American.
	  Bart: It's valuable, huh?
Comic Book Guy: Ooh, your powers of deduction are exceptional. I simply
		can't allow you to waste them here when there are so
		many crimes going unsolved at this very moment. Go! go!
		for the good of the city!
	  Bart: Loser.
-- Sarcasm 101, 

The next morning, Homer and the kids are waked by the sounds of the
parade. Little did they know, they chose to place their seats behind
what would be the emplacement for a 15' stand. "Aw, nertz!" comments
Homer.

Homer tries to see something from his position.

Homer: Which one's Itchy? The car?
 Bart: The mouse.
Homer: Oh. I guess it's not him then.
-- If only they wore name tags, 

Of course, TV and radio have sent their commentators to this parade.

 Dave: [in a wooden voice] Represented on this next float is Roger
       Myers Sr., who founded his company in 1921, and struck it big
       when he teamed up a mouse named Itchy with a cat named Scratchy.
       Here we see him creating the two comical characters out of
       thoughts he plucks from his head.
Susan: [excited] And that man waving from the front of the float is his
       son, Roger Myers Jr! Oh, isn't this just the most fun you've
       ever had in your life, Dave?
 Dave: Yes Susan. It is.
-- I hear ya loud and clear, 

Homer tries to get the kids to see the parade by taking them on his
shoulders, but they end up on the floor. Bart has had enough of this,
and decides to join the parade.

Susan: Oh, now the parade has entered Bumtown! Oh, it's all just so
       exciting Dave!
 Dave: This certainly seems to be a poorly planned parade route.
-- Quimby probably worked on it, 

Effectively, there's a lot of alarm and glass-breaking noises in this
part of town. Itchys and Scratchys run back in the cars, and the
parade speeds up its walk, leaving Bart behind.


As they leave Bumtown, a bum runs after them, throwing tomatoes and
insulting Roger Myers.

Get out of Bumtown, you bum!
-- A bum, 

Bart asks him to show some respect to the man who created Itchy and
Scratchy.

Chester: He didn't create Itchy: I did.
   Bart: Huh?
Chester: He stole the character from me in 1928. When I complained, his
	 thugs kicked me out of his office, and dropped an anvil on me.
	 Luckily, I was carrying an umbrella at the time.
-- Yipes!, 

   Bart: You invented Itchy? The _Itchy &amp; Scratchy_ Itchy?
Chester: Sure. In fact, I invented the whole concept of cartoon
	 violence. Before I came along, all cartoon animals did was
	 play the ukulele. I changed all that.
   Bart: Well, I'm not calling you a liar but... but I can't think of a
	 way to finish that sentence.
-- Isn't that nice, 

To prove his point, Chester J. Lampwick hands him the reel of "Itchy
the Lucky Mouse in: Manhattan Madness", the first Itchy cartoon ever
made. All he needs a 90-year-old projector. And where else could you
find a 90-year-old projector than Springfield Elementary?

Later that day, Bart and Milhouse watch the silent movie as Chester
plays the piano. It features Itchy, walking peacefully in Manhattan.
Bart reads the first cue card: "Itchy runs afoul of an Irishman."
Milhouse warns Itchy, "Look out Itchy, he's Irish!"  As Itchy is
about to shake hands with the Irishman, a lightbulb appears over his
head, as he has an idea. He grabs the lightbulb, and knocks down the
Irishman with it. Pulling him by his beard, he sticks it in an old-
fashioned wringer, and squeeze the poor man.  ("But 'twas all in good
fun!")  "Come on, Itchy! Kill that guy!" Milhouse screams.  Milhouse
reads the next cue card, "A chance for more mischief".  Bart laughs
at the "fat oaf", but Milhouse tells him that it's Teddy Roosevelt.
The cue card reads: "Ah, Manhattan Town. An agreeable sight for an
Old Knickerbocker such as myself."  Never running out of ideas, Itchy
grabs an axe and chops Roosevelt's head off. Covered with blood, he
winks at the camera as the kids laugh themselves out. Follows a bunch
of credits (creator, director, cellu-lamino artist, electrocity [sic]
engineer, ethnographer), all bearing the name of Chester J. Lampwick.
The movie is copyrighted 1919.

Bart: I can't believe it. That was Itchy all right, you _did_ invent
      him. When people see this you'll be rich and famous!
       [turns over to the film, to see it burn in the projector]
      D'oh.
-- The least I can say, 

[End of Act One.  Time: 6'29"]

Chester: That was a nice film I had once. Last time I try to impress a
	 four-year-old.
-- You were... the age Bart was... several years ago,
   

Chester throws away the burned reel and walks away, but Bart doesn't
give up so easily.

   Bart: You can't just go back to the gutter. You created Itchy, you
	 should be a millionaire.
Chester: Ah, Roger Myers wouldn't give me a cent in the '20s. Why would
	 he give me anything now?
   Bart: You asked Roger Myers _Sr._ for money. Roget Myers Jr. is in
	 charge of the studio now. He's a good man; every Christmas he
	 goes down to the pound and rescues one cat and one mouse and
	 gives them to a hungry family.
-- The compassion of Roger Myers Jr., 

The studio's closed until Tuesday; animators have A.A. on Monday.
-- Chester's inside comment on cartoon animation,
   

Bart offers hospitality to Chester, as his parents won't mind since
they won't know about it.

   Bart: There's a box you can sleep in.
Chester: Thanks.
   Bart: Just move that cot out of the way.
Chester: Okay.
   Bart: Do you know what radon is?
Chester: No.
   Bart: Good night.
-- Pleasant dreams, 

As Homer walks by the basement door, a voice asks for spare change
from below. He throws some.

Lisa is a little more suspicious, though.

Mom, there's a weird smell and a lot of cursing coming from the
basement and Dad's upstairs!
-- Lisa warns her mother, 

Homer decides to check this through, so he takes his snake-chasing
equipment and puts on a stainless steel colander. Marge turns on the
basement lights, and all can see Bart and Chester eating sandwiches.

Homer: Oh, it's just Bart and a mysterious stranger.
-- No need to worry, 

Bart: He's not a regular bum, Mom; he's a genius bum. He created Itchy
      _and_ he's the father of cartoon violence.
       [Snowball II runs away in fear]
-- 

Marge accepts to house him for one night.

The next day, at Itchy &amp; Scratchy studios (est. 1921)...

  Myers: So let's review. You two screwballs have just strolled in here
	 fresh from the sewer and given me a bunch of bulldink about
	 creating Itchy with no proof at all, and you expect me to give
	 you... how much?
Chester: 800 billion dollars.
-- A fair answer, 

Next thing they know, Bart and Chester are thrown out of I&amp;S Studios.
"That brought back a lot of memories" philosophizes Chester.

Then they try their luck at "I can't believe it's a law firm!"

Hutz: All right, gentlemen, I'll take your case. But I'm going to have
      to ask for a thousand-dollar retainer.
Bart: A thousand dollars? But your ad says "No money down".
       [shows his paper ad: "Works on contingency basis. No money
        down."]
Hutz: Oh! They got this all screwed up...
       [makes a few corrections: "Works on contingency basis? No, money
        down!"]
Bart: So you _don't_ work on a contingency basis?
Hutz: No, money down! Oops, it shouldn't have this Bar Association logo
      here either.
-- Rewriting the laws by himself, 

Bart and Chester come home depressed. There's only one solution left.

 Bart: Hey Dad, can I have a thousand dollars?
Homer: All right... [gets his wallet] Wait a minute! For what?
 Bart: To pay for a lawyer, for my bum.
Homer: Forget it!
-- 

That night, OFF is eating supper with Abe and Chester, who keep
staring at each other.

 Grampa: I thought I recognized you. I gave you a plate of corn muffins
	 back in 1947 to paint my chicken coop. And you never did it.
Chester: Those corn muffins were lousy.
 Grampa: Paint my chicken coop!
Chester: Make me!
	  [Abe jumps on him, and they fight on the floor]
-- 

Marge: That does it! One of them has to go.
Homer: Okay, Grampa.
Marge: No, the B-U-M.
Homer: [moans]
-- The love of Homer for his father shows up yet again,
   

Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. There's an easy way to get rid of Chester
without the guilt of sending him back to the gutter. And all it'll cost
you is a thousand dollars.
-- Bart pledges for Chester, 

Next day, the Springfield Shopper reads: "Bum Sues Cartoon King --
Got Legal Fee From Some Family".

Roger Myers Jr. is building his defense with the help of Burns'
lawyer. The first exhibit is "Steamboat Itchy", dated 1928, and
clearly produced by Roger Myers.

You will also notice Mr. Myers' name and copyright notice on the
original drawings of the other members of the Itchy &amp; Scratchy family:
Brown-Nose Bear, Disgruntled Goat, Flatulent Fox, Rich Uncle Skeleton
and Dinner Dog.
-- The Itchy &amp; Scratchy family as it was born,
   

  Hutz: My client's film predates all of those things your Honor.
Lawyer: Oh _yes_! I've forgotten! Your famous film, the one you
	destroyed before the trial and haven't been able to find
	another copy of! Oh yes, _that_ film.
  Hutz: Yes. You don't have a copy, do you?
-- The first lesson of Law 101: Bring your _own_ evidence,
   

Krusty is the first witness called to the bar by the defense.

 Lawyer: Krusty, have you _ever_ seen this so-called animation genius
	 before?
 Krusty: Yes I have.
 Lawyer: [surprised] You have?
 Krusty: I gave him a couple of blintzes to paint my fence, but he
	 never did it!
Chester: Those blintzes were terrible.
 Krusty: Paint my fence!
Chester: Make me!
 Krusty: [jumping on him] You give me back those blintzes!
  Judge: Order, order. We don't care about your blintzes.
-- 

It is now turn for the prosecutor to call Chester to the bar.

  Hutz: Now, Mr. Lampwick, when Mr. Myers stole your character...
Lawyer: Objection.
 Judge: Sustained.
  Hutz: Urgh! If I hear "objection" and "sustained" one more time
	today, I think I'm going to scream!
Lawyer: Objection.
 Judge: Sustained.
  Hutz: [screams]
-- He gave his word, 

Chester claims that Myers stole all of his characters.

The only characters Myers could ever come up with were pathetic stick
figures with the words "Sarcastic Horse" and "Manic Mailman" printed on
them. And they stank.
-- Chester comments on Myers' talent, 

But Myers Jr. calls this a lie.

 Hutz: Are you saying, _under oath_ Mr. Myers, that your father didn't
       steal any of the characters associated with your studio?
Myers: Well, I don't think I _am_ under oath, but... yes, my father
       created them all. Except for Flatulent Fox, that was based on a
       true story.
-- The inspiration of a cartoonist, 

Judge: Mr. Hutz, we've been in here for four hours. Do you have any
       evidence at all?
 Hutz: Well, your Honor, we've got plenty of hearsay and conjecture,
       those are _kinds_ of evidence.
-- The eternal question: where did he get his diploma?,
   

Myers' lawyer moves for dismissal, but Bart --guess what-- has an
idea, and borrow $750 from Homer.

    Bart: Keep the trial going, I'll be right back.
    Hutz: Your Honor, I'd like to call all of my surprise witnesses
	  again.
Audience: [moans]
-- The usual, proven good ol' methods, 

Bart goes to the comic store, and we hear the sound of a cash
register.


Back to the trial, Bart exhibits --surprise!-- the $750-worth drawing
of Itchy he saw in the comic book store, which happens to be
identical to the Itchy in "Manhattan Madness". However, the lawyer
refutes this as being proof, since it isn't signed or dated.


Chester helps him: "Look under the frame, Brad." After breaking the
glass and tearing the painting a little, he finds something.

To Roger Myers, keep drawing, your moxie more than makes up for your
lack of talent. Your pal, Chester J. Lampwick, September 3, 1919
-- Chester's word of encouragement to Myers,
     

The audience is stunned.

Myers: Okay, maybe my dad did steal Itchy, but so what? Animation is
       built on plagiarism!
	[lawyer slaps his forehead]
       If it weren't for someone plagiarizing the Honeymooners, we
       wouldn't have the Flintstones. If someone hadn't ripped off Sgt.
       Bilko, they'd be no Top Cat. Huckleberry Hound, Chief Wiggum,
       Yogi Bear? Hah! Andy Griffith, Edward G. Robinson, Art Carney.
-- Er, don't forget Yogi Berra,         

Myers: Your honor, you take away our right to steal ideas, where are
       they gonna come from? Her?  [points at Marge]
Marge: Uh... Hmm... How about... Ghostmutt?
-- I see your point, 

The court rules in favor of Mr. Lampwick. Itchy &amp; Scratchy Studios will
pay a restitution of 800 billion dollars... though that amount will
probably come down a bit on appeal.
-- The judge delivers the verdict, 

In front of Itchy &amp; Scratchy Studios, Myers hands Chester his $800
billion check, and lets it go after stuggling a bit.

  Myers: I hope you're happy, kid; the studio's bankrupt. You just
	 killed Itchy &amp; Scratchy.
	  [closes the studio's gate, bearing a "Out of business" sign]
   Bart: We killed Itchy &amp; Scratchy?
Chester: Good riddance. Wanna go celebrate? I feel like liver and
	 onions. [smacks his lips]
-- Can liver and onions be as funny as Itchy &amp; Scratchy?,
   

As Chester walks away, every light and machine in Itchy &amp; Scratchy
Studios is shut down.

[End of Act Two.  Time: 14'43"]


Back in OFF house, Chester repays Homer for all his troubles, and
goes on the road, whistling "We're in the Money", to find himself the
solid gold house he's always dreamed of.

Meanwhile, others try to cope with the loss of Itchy &amp; Scratchy, like
Krusty...

Well, Itchy &amp; Scratchy are gone, but here's a cartoon that tries to
make learning fun!
   [tries to laugh, then moans]
Sorry about this kids, but stay tuned; we've got some real good toy
commercials coming right up, I swear.
-- Krusty (At least he's not showing Worker &amp; Parasite),
   

Until then, they have nothing else to air but an old Schoolhouse
Rock.

Bart: What the hell is this?
Lisa: It's one of those campy '70s throwbacks that appeals to
      Generation Xers.
Bart: We need another Vietnam to thin out their ranks a little.
-- 

They continue watching the atrocity until the end.

Lisa: So it's true: some cartoons _do_ encourage violence.
       [punches Bart]
Bart: Ow! We gotta get Itchy &amp; Scratchy back.
Lisa: And soon!
       [punches Bart]
Bart: Ow!
Lisa: [chuckles]
-- And how, 

Bart &amp; Lisa go see Myers, who is now living at Worst Western, using
some TV boxes as a desk.

 Bart: You've got to make more Itchy &amp; Scratchy cartoons.
 Lisa: The judge says it's okay as long as you pay Mr. Lampwick
       royalties.
Myers: Royalties! Hah! I don't have the money to _produce_ the
       cartoons. I lost everything. I can't even keep my dad's head in
       the freakin' cryogenics center anymore.
	[shot of a thawing icebox, which starts shaking]
       [sarcasticly] You're comfortable in there, daddy?
-- So where's the rest of his body?, 

Since they need money, Bart figures he could ask someone who has lots
of it.

Chester:  [as Kent Brockman walks in front of his gold house]
	 Shoeshine, sir? Comb your hair for ya? Sir?
	  [Kents walks away in contempt]
	 Sir? Sir? Sir? Okay, catch you on the way back.
-- After all, he only won $130 million, 

The kids try to get Chester into financing other Itchy &amp; Scratchy
cartoons, but he doesn't want to hear about it.

I don't need any more money, I'm not greedy. As long as I've got my
health, and my millions of dollars and my gold house and my rocket car,
I don't need anything else.
-- Chester, a simple man, 

Ultimately, Bart turns to his father.

 Bart: Dad, can we have $183,000?
Homer: [Gets his wallet] What for?
 Bart: Lisa and I want to finance a series of animated cartoons.
Homer: Oh. Forget it!
-- 

As a last resort, Bart reads through "Animation Legal Precedents", as
Lisa investigates "Copyright Law: 1918-1923".

Lisa: [moans] I give up, there's nothing we can do.
Bart: Yeah, I agree. You wanna start on trying to get Apu out of jail?
Lisa: Okay.
       [they pull out "Public Nudity: Codes and Statutes"]
-- A side of him we didn't know, 

But Marge knows them better.  "Wait, kids, you can't give up on Itchy
&amp; Scratchy, you're so good at these things."  Marge names several
situations in which Bart and Lisa lend an, ahem, helping hand.
Lisa agrees, and takes a look at Bart's book; it doesn't take long
that she spots something. They both race their bicycles to Itchy &amp;
Scratchy Studios.

  Bart: What a perfect plan. Now, Roger Myers will tell as just...
 Myers: [announcing the studio's re-opening]
	And so when no one could think of a plan to resurect Itchy &amp;
	Scratchy, a young boy, a wonderful irrepressible young boy,
	took it on his own to solve the problem. He discovered that the
	postal service's Mr. Zip. was just a rip-off of my father's
	stick figure character Manic Mailman.
	 [crowd murmors]
	So the government gave me a _huge_ cash settlement, and Itchy &amp;
	Scratchy Studios is back in business.
	 [engines start up again]
	Thanks to you, Lester.
	 [a Tracey-Ullman-era Bart comes on stage]
  Bart: What the hell is going on?
  Lisa: I don't know, but it looks like you might have a little
	competition all of a sudden.
Lester: Thanks everybody, but I couldn't have done all this without the
	help of my brainy sister Eliza.
	 [a Tracey-Ullman-era Lisa joins him]
  Lisa: [gasps]
-- Bart and Lisa meet their alter egos, 

Apu comes on stage:

I do owe many thanks to Lester and Eliza. This is a great vindication
for anybody who has ever taken a bath, went to get the paper, fell
down, and the door slam behind them and the doorknow break off.
-- A day in the life of Apu, 

Krusty: And I'd like to thank Lester for reuniting me with my estranged
	wife.
	 [applause]
  Bart: I never even heard about that.
-- They probably lost the script, 

Effectively, Lisa is confused too.

 Bart: I guess you don't need it now, but, we had a plan too.
Myers: Hey, great, listen, write it down and mail it to last week, when
       I might've cared. I've got cartoons to make, kids.
-- That's his way of saying "Thank you", 

It seems that everything has returned to normal, and Itchy &amp; Scratchy
is back on the air.  The episode shown is dedicated to Lester and
Eliza, "for making all this possible". Marge suggests that Bart and
Lisa must be happy to see their "cute little friends" back on the
air. Lisa says that "technically everything worked out all right",
but as Bart explains: "I wasn't the one who solved the problem, and
neither was Lisa. There's something unsettling about that."


At that moment, Lester rides on his skateboard in front of the house,
and him and Bart stare at each other, while some dramatic music is
heard.

 EPISODE TITLE: A Fish Called Selma


EPISODE SUMMARY:  {fb}

    
    TV: "Movie For A Rained-Out Ballgame" now returns to Dyan Cannon,
	Troy McClure, and the Muppets in the 1977 film: "The Muppets Go
	Medieval".
  Troy: Oh Princess Fair, wilst thou grant me thine dainty hoof in
	marriage?
 Piggy: Oh, Sir Lies-A-Lot, I will!
	 [they kiss each other]
  Troy: [purrs]
Kermit: [in armor, wielding a sword] Unhand the swine, you swain! Come,
	Piggy. back to Hamelot.
 Piggy: Heck no, frog. Me and Iron Pants are just getting acquinted.
-- 

Troy and Kermit duel, but as Kermit grunts at the effort, it's quite
obvious that Troy doesn't even bother to move his sword.

Our favorite family is wathing this movie on TV.

 Lisa: Dad, what's a muppet?
Homer: Well, it's not quite a mop, and it's not quite a puppet, but
       man... [laughs] So to answer your question I don't know.
-- No deep thoughts yet, I see, 

 Bart: Why'd they make that one muppet out of leather?
Marge: That's not a leather muppet, that's Troy McClure. Mmm, back in
       the '70s he was quite a teen heartthrob.
Homer: Yeah, who'd have thought he'd turn out to be such a weirdo?
Marge: What are you talking about?
Homer: You know, his bizarre personal life. Those weird things they say
       he does down at the aquarium. Why I heard...
Marge: Oh, Homer, that's just an urban legend. People don't do that
       type of thing with _fish_!
-- He may hold you to that, 

Troy McClure's a perfect gentleman, like Bing Crosby or JFK.
-- Now who's being naive, Marge?, 

Marge concludes: "I wonder where Troy is now."

Answering her question, we get to follow a DeLorean bearing a "Follow
me to Springfield Aquarium!" bumper sticker. Of course, the driver is
Troy McClure, and he seems to have vision problems, as he knocks
almost every parked car he can find. "Hey, these cars are all over the
road!" he blames, just before a siren is heard from behind. He parks,
and Chief Wiggum comes out of a police car.

Wiggum: All right, Captain Rush-Rush, out of the car!
	 [Troy slams the DeLorean's door in his face]
	Ow, I'm seeing stars here!
  Troy: No, just one! Hi, I'm Troy McClure; you may remember me from
	such films as "The Greatest Story Ever Hulaed", and "They Came
	to Burgle Carnegie Hall".
-- 

Wiggum doesn't remember Troy from such films.

Wiggum: License please?
	 [Troy hands his license]
	Says here you need corrective lenses. Put those glasses on,
	Mister.
  Troy: You wouldn't ask a handsome man like me to wear glasses? It'd
	be a crime against nature!
	 [groans, then puts his glasses on, which are powerful
         magnifiers]
Wiggum: [surprised] Gaa! Well, they do kinda make you look like a
	nerd... Tell you what, just go down to the DMV tomorrow, try to
	pass that eye test. I'll tear up this ticket but I'm uh...
	still gonna have to ask you for a bribe.
-- Professional as always, 

The next day, at the DMV, it's still another day for Patty and Selma.

Grampa: [to Selma] Hello Marge. [to Patty] Hello Marge.
 Selma: [groans] How come no Chippendales dancers ever come in to renew
	their licenses?
 Patty: They carpool, that's the problem.
	 [stamps Grampa's license]
Grampa: Hey! I came here to get this revoked!
-- The passionate life of a DMV employee, 

Troy McClure walks into the DMV, which brings murmurs from the crowd.

Hibbert: Troy McClure? I thought he disappeared after that scandal at
	 the aquarium.
  Louie: Hey, I thought you said Troy McClure was dead.
   Tony: No, what I said was: "He sleeps with the fishes". You see...
  Louie: Uh, Tony, please, no. I just ate a whole plate of
	 dingamagoo...
-- And it doesn't look pretty on the way out, 

Next thing Selma knows, Troy is standing in front of her. "Whoa...
Troy McClure!" she utters. Troy just stands there gazing at her
beauty, until he recalls his glasses and puts them on. The shock to
harsh reality is brutal.

 Troy: [surprised in disgust] Uh... Hello, beautiful! John Law tells me
       I might need to wear these glasses.
Selma: You? [giggle] Nonsense! You're Troy McClure! I remember you from
       such films as "Meet Joe Blow" and "Give My Remains to Broadway".
       Stars like you don't need glasses.
	[Troy smiles suggestively at Selma, who smiles back at him]
Patty: Yech!
-- That's still some improvement over Barney, 

Selma: Now, Mr. McClure, would you like to take off those glasses, and
       read the top line? [points to an eye chart]
 Troy: Err... W... 7... star... pound... uh...
       Look, Ms... [looks at Selma's name plate] Bouvier, as an actor I
       depend on my remarkable looks.
	[Selma smiles silently]
       If you could find in your heart to pass me, I'm sure I could
       find some way to repay you.
Selma: [gulps] Mubble.
 Troy: Say, by buying you dinner?
	[Selma smiles with joy and stamps his license several times]
 Troy: That took a lot of class.
-- His charms are still working, 

That night, they're having dinner at the Pimento Grove, a very chic
restaurant, with many pictures of celebrities as part of the decor.
Selma seems to be having fun, but Troy is yawning of boredom.

Selma: All these celebrities on the walls; I'm just know a big star
       like you is up there somewhere.
 Troy: Uh, yes, I'm over there... [vaguely points somewhere]
Selma: [as she browses the walls] Hmm... Uh... Huh-uh. Hmm?
	[finally finds Troy's picture on the pet door]
       Oh!
-- "Cats", anyone?, 

 Troy: So, working at the DMV must be very interesting.
Selma: Well, uh... I think I'm getting Repetitive Stress Disorder from
       scratching my butt all day.
       [clears throat]
       Being a huge movie star must be good too. What are you working
       on now?
 Troy: I've been reading a lot of scripts lately. You know, it's a lot
       cheaper than _going_ to the movies.
-- But it's just not the same, 

At the end of their not-so-enchanted evening...

   Selma: Well, thanks for holding up your end of the bargain. I had a
	  pretty good time.
    Troy: [sounding tired] Yeah, me too. You need a ride, somewhere...
Reporter: Hey, get a load of this: Troy McClure and what looks like a
	  date!
	   [many reporters gather and take pictures]
    Troy: Here you go, boys: a little something for page one.
	   [kisses Selma on the cheek]
-- 

Actually, the picture is printed on "Page Ten" of the Springfield
Shopper, following the crossword puzzles; nevertheless, it is noticed
by many people.

Lenny: Hey, Homer, isn't this your sister-in-law on a date with Troy
       McClure?
Homer: Pft... Troy McClure. He's a washed-up movie star, he could be
       dating washed-up supermodels.
Lenny: Ho, I don't know. Maybe those rumors about his fish fetish
       weren't true after all.
 Carl: Ah, this changes everything; I'd pay to see him in a movie now.
       If only that were possible.
-- 

Meanwhile, Troy is in his futuristic house, built on top of a pole,
and on the verge of crumbling. Reflecting his tastes, the master
bedroom is composed of a coral bed, surrounded by aquariums. The
phone rings as he is applying the knowledge of a book titled "Bean-
Bag Furniture Repair" to his own bean bag.

Parker: Troy, my man, it's MacArthur Parker.
  Troy: MacArthur Parker the agent? MacArthur Parker _my_ agent?
Parker: Heh heh, just checking in, my friend. So how's my favorite
	client?
  Troy: We haven't spoken in eight years...
Parker: Yes... So I saw the papers today Troy, looking good, that
	wholesome stuff really helps when I'm trying to find you work.
  Troy: You haven't found me work in _twelve_ years!
Parker: [chuckles] Oh you, Jury duty is work.
-- The duty or the movie?, 

Parker: And listen, you keep getting seen in public with human females,
	and I can get you work in the _entertainment_ industry.
  Troy: Hmm... [looks at the article] Hey...
	 [dials]
	Hello, Selma Bouvier? It's Troy McClure. You may remember me
	from such dates as last night's dinner.
-- The running gag continueth, 

Troy's takes her to the Ugli, and this time reporters are surrounding
them.

Troy: That's right boys, Troy's back from the gutter, and he's brought
      someone with him!
-- That's flattering, 

 Troy: [laughing] That's too funny! I can't remember when I've heard a
       funnier anecdote. [laughing] All right, now you tell one.
Selma: Well, not much happens to me. But I once had dinner with a movie
       star, and it was the most wonderful night of my life.
 Troy: Really? Who was it, George Segal? I hear he plays the banjo.
-- Watched him in "The Babysitter", too, 

As Troy misses the point, Selma feels an urge to smoke a cigarette.
However, she merely has the time to light one before everyone around
looks at her in disgust.

   Man: Excuse me, I ordered a Zima, not emphysema...
Server: Please, don't smoke in our restaurant; we don't serve
	contemporary Californian cuisine in your lungs...
-- He's got a point, 

Ashamed of ruining their evening, Selma walks out to sob and smoke
her cigarette. "Got a light?", asks Troy behind her. They both smoke
(and cough), to Selma's pleasure.

At Marge's home, she tells her and Patty about her love story. She
says he's taking her out to a special screening of his latest film.

Next Friday, the Route 18 Flea Market and Drive-In features his
latest film, which is, in fact, The Muppets Go Medieval. Of course,
they're the only car parked in the whole lot.

You know, smoke actually smells good when it's coming out of you.
-- Selma on a date, 

Selma: You know, smoke actually smells good when it's coming out of
       you... Oh, I'm all out.
 Troy: Here, try one of my cigars.
Selma: [does so] My God! It's like five cigarettes at once! Oh, my head
       is swimming!
 Troy: That's not cigars, baby: that's love.
	[in echo with the movie dialogue]
       No longer canst I conceal my love, my wimpled turtledove.
Piggy: Whoa...
Selma: Whoa...
 Troy: Oh Princess fair, wilst thou grant me thine dainty hoof in
       marriage?
	[shows Selma a wedding ring]
Piggy: Oh, Sir Lies-A-Lot, I will!
Selma: Oh, Troy,           I will!
	[Troy slips the ring to her finger, then they kiss]
 Troy: Just a second baby.
	[sprays breath freshener in her mouth, then resumes kissing]
-- 

[End of Act One.  Time: 8'43"]

Troy's wedding generates a lot of attention, even from Entertainment
Tonight.

ET Man: '70s leading man Troy McClure has finally met the woman of his
	dreams. We may rememb... woman? Huh, okay! We may remember Troy
	from such films as "The Verdict Was Mail Fraud", and "Leper in
	the Backfield".
	 [clip of Troy as a football player]
	 [he catches the ball, backs up, and then his arm breaks off]
  Lori: [laughs, then stops brutally] With his high-profile romance,
	Troy's managed to shake the rumors that have dogged his carrer.
	And with news of his upcoming wedding, rumor has it he's up for
	some very choice roles.
ET Man: Looks like you were wrong when you called him a washed-up
	deviant, eh Lori? [chuckles] All right...
-- Entertainment Tonight, no worse than usual, 

Preparing for the wedding, Selma is moving to Troy's house.

Selma: Make sure my iguana's okay.
 Troy: Selma, Jub-Jub is fantastic. He's everywhere you wanna be.
	[shows Selma her room]
       Welcome to your new home baby, it's fantastic.
       Garbage collection is Monday; if you want to throw out a box,
       you have to cut it up.
-- Damn P.C. recycling thugs, 

Selma: It's so modern... it's ultra-modern, like living in a
       not-to-distant future.
 Troy: Now you make yourself at home here, I'll be sleeping downstairs
       in the visitors center.
Selma: Oh... okay.
 Troy: I'll see you in the morning. And get ready for tennis; it comes
       on at 10. [winks]
-- But I wanna watch MacGuyver, 

	 [phone rings]
Parker: Troy! Mac Parker. Ever hear of... Planet of the Apes?
  Troy: Uh... the movie or the planet?
Parker: The brand-new multimillion dollar musical. And _you_ are
	starring... as the human.
  Troy: It's the part I was born to play, baby!
-- He does look like a human, too, 

It's the premiere of "Stop the Planet of the Apes, I Want to Get
Off!" in Springfield, and everyone is gathered to witness the
comeback of Troy McClure.

 Bart: [in admiration] This play has everything!
Homer: Oh, I love legitimate theater.
-- They're butchering the classics!, 

 Troy: Thank you, it's great to be back. I just want to say, I wouldn't
       be here without the support of a very special lady; my always
       outrageous fiancee Selma. Take a bow, sugar beet!
Selma: [shy] Oh... well... oh...
Homer: Down in front!
-- You with the hair, 

At Troy's house, the kids and Homer are enjoying the pool.

Troy: My good looks paid for that pool, and my talent filled it with
      water. Hi, I'm Troy McClure, your future uncle.
Lisa: Hi. I remember you from such filmstrips as Locker Room Towel
      Fight: the Blinding of Larry Driscoll.
Troy: You know, I was one of the first to speak out against horseplay.
Lisa: Uh-huh...
-- The fascinating story of Troy McClure, 

Selma: Remember when we were kids, we used to dream about our ideal
       husbands? Who knew the dream would come true for one of us.
	[Marge looks disappointed]
       Oh, come on! Guess which one.
Homer: I know, I know; it's Selma, right?
-- He knows his flaws, 

At Moe's, Homer is teaching Troy about how to get drunk.

 Troy: [drunk] Yeah, it's a good idea, Homer, but they've already made
       some movies about WW II.
Homer: Ah, hell... Well, what about Dracula?
 Troy: Homer, I'm really touched you invited me out on the town. You're
       gonna be a four-star brother-in-law.
Homer: Troy buddy, I gotta know. What's a great guy like you wanna
       marry a guy like Selma?
-- Has she gone through sex change yet?, 

Troy whispers the reason in Homer's ear, and seems to find the
situation very funny. Homer, on the other side, looks disturbed.

Anywho, the wedding is still being held, and at Springfield Botanical
Gardens over that.

 Rev.: And do you, Selma Bouvier Terwilliger Bouvier, take the fabulous
       Troy McClure to be your lawful wedded husband?
Selma: I already told you, yes.
 Rev.: If anyone here knows why this couple should not be wed in holy
       matrimony, let him speak now or forever hold his peace.
	[zoom in on Homer's head]
Brain: [singing to himself "Rock 'N Roll Part Two"]
       Dah, dah, dah-dah-dah, hey! Dah-dah, dah-dah!
       Dah, dah, dah-dah-dah, hey! Dah-dah!
-- And that's only 10% of his brain capacity, 

 Rev.: I now pronounce you husband and wife, you may now kiss... each
       other.
	[as Troy turns himself to smile to the cameras, Selma ends up
         kissing him on the cheek]
Selma: This is the best day of my life.
 Troy: It's a good day for me too, baby. Now smile, we're gonna be on
       every newstand in the country!
-- That's what I meant too, 

That night, at bed...

Homer: Hey, look what I snagged, Marge: the candy bride and groom from
       the wedding cake!
	[swallows them painfully, as they seem to be made in metal]
	[he finally succeeds, as we hear a little splash]
       Mmm... pointy.
-- Mmm... ulcer, 

Marge: It was a beautiful wedding. I've never seen Selma happier.
Homer: That reminds me, Troy said something interesting last night at
       the bar. Apparently he doesn't really love Selma and the
       marriage is just a sham to help his carreer. Well, enough talk
       -- let's snuggle.
-- Caring Homer, 

Marge: What? Oh my God!
	[Homer turns off the light]
	[we can still see Marge's eyes in the dark -- as in any cartoon]
Homer: Marge, could you close your eyes? I'm trying to sleep.
	[Marge does so]
       There.
-- Meta-humor at its best, 

[End of Act Two.  Time: 15'16"]

At Aphrodite Inn, MacArthur Parker is reading the Springfield
Shopper, of which Troy's Wedding made the front page.

This better be important, it's my wedding night. I'm trying to sleep!
-- Troy's views on wedding nights, 

   Parker: Hey sleep is for has-beens, my friend, and you're about to
	   have a very crowded schedule. This marriage scam is paying
	   off big time.
Bartender: Phone for you.
     Troy: T.McC.
    Selma: Troy, darling, come to bed. I wanna the Troy McClure I
	   remember from such films as "Make-Out King of Montana" and
	   "The Electric Gigolo". [chuckles]
-- Urgh..., 

  Troy: Yeah, in a minute... darling.
	 [hangs up]
	Well, she may be helping my career, but she's starting to cramp
	my style.
Parker: Oh, who cares, the offers are rolling in. Paramount wants you
	for a buddy comedy with Rob Lowe and Hugh Grant.
  Troy: Those sick freaks?
-- Look who's talking, 

Parker: Okay, then get this: I think they want you to play McBain's
	sidekick in... brace yourself, the new McBain movie!
  Troy: McBain's sidekick? Hot damn! I'm going to Sea world!
-- More shameless promotion, 

Meanwhile, Marge and Patty try to tell Selma that Troy is just using
her, but she doesn't want to admit it. She runs away to find Troy and
find answer to her questions.

Selma: [menacing] Is this a sham marriage?
 Troy: Sure baby, is that a problemo?
-- Fair enough, 

Selma: You _married_ me just to help you carreer?
 Troy: You make it sound so sordid, look: don't we have a good time
       together?
Selma: Yes, but...
 Troy: Don't you have everything you ever wanted here? Money, security,
       a big hot flat rock for Jub Jub?
-- Just what everyone would want, 

Selma: But... don't you love me?
 Troy: Sure I do! Like I love Fresca. Isn't that enough? The only
       difference between our marriage and any one else's is: we know
       ours is a sham.
-- When you look at it this way..., 

Selma: Are you gay?
 Troy: Gay? I wish! If I were gay they'd be no problem! No, what I have
       is a romantic abnormality, one so unbelievable that it must be
       hidden from the public at all cost. You see...
Selma: Stop!
-- Aw, we were just about to hear it all, 

But Troy insists on the fact that it's easy, and that she would go to
the right places and meet the right people. Who would turn down such
an offer?

Troy: Sure, you'll be a sham wife, but you'll be the envy of every
      other sham wife in town!
-- Wow, what a bargain!, 

Selma accepts, and the merry couple assists to the inauguration of
Troy's sidewalk star, replacing Buster Keaton's.

Troy: One day, my lady Selma's gonna have a star right next to mine, so
      watch out... Laszlo Panaflex.
-- That's some tough competition, 

ET Man: Tonight, all Hollywood's wondering who'll be chosen to co-star
	in the big new McBain pic, Mc Bain IV: Fatal Discharge.
	 [phone rings]
Parker: Oh, you're watching?
  Troy: Mac, you gotta get me that part!
Parker: I will, but you gotta do something for me; problem is the big
	parts these days are all going to family men.
  Troy: But I already got married!
Parker: Yeah, for a role like this, you gotta pour it on. You and your,
	er, wife have gotta have a baby.
  Troy: A baby, eh? What do I do?
Parker: I'll send you over a pamphlet. Listen, you can't buy that kind
	of P.R., but you can get it for nothing by having a baby,
	which, by the way, your insurance will cover, except for the
	deductible which I'll reimburse you for if you get the part
	which you will if you have a baby.
  Troy: C'est Troi Bien!
Parker: Okay. Now listen, let's talk baby names. You can't use Montana,
	Dakota or Florida, they're taken...
  Troy: Hmm... Oregon?
Parker: Oh, Pacific North-West, very hot.
-- 

At Ugli, Selma is pondering the question.

Selma: Having a child? That's a big step.
 Troy: You bet it is, think what it'll mean! Not just the McBain movie,
       but maybe my own fragrance: Smellin' of Troy.
-- Troy's illusions of grandeur, 

 Selma: Hmm... It is probably my last chance to be a mommy.
Waiter: Cigarette, Mrs. McClure?
  Troy: You bet! From now on, she's smoking for two!
-- 

So, that night, Troy and Selma are trying the best they can; Selma in
bed, and Troy in the bedroom's door frame.

Selma: Er... come here, tiger!
 Troy: [growls, but doesn't know what to do next]
Selma: Mmm... would you like some wine?
 Troy: Yes!
	[comes and drinks both his and Selma's glasses]
	[goes back to the door]
       [growls]
Selma: Er... why don't you come over here, and make yourself more
       comfortable?
 Troy: No... why don't _you_ come over here and make _yourself_
       comfortable?
-- He _does_ need to learn the basics, 

 Troy: I'm sorry, this whole concept's foreign to me. Who knew a baby
       would be so much work?
Selma: Having a baby isn't supposed to be work, it's supposed to be an
       expression of the feelings we're supposed to have for each
       other.
 Troy: Oh. Like how we built that snowman together in that Newport ad,
       remember how alive with pleasure they said we were?
-- He's supposed to get it someday, 

Selma: Hmmm... Look, I'm sorry. A loveless marriage is one thing, we're
       not hurting anybody. But bringing a child into a loveless family
       is something I just can't do.
 Troy: [relieved] Great, we'll adopt! I'll call my agent, he'll
       find some kid who wants in on the deal.
-- Macaulay Culkin or Tiffany perhaps, 

Selma says goodbye to Troy: "I'll always remember you, but not from
your films." She walks away with Jub Jub.

Come on Jub Jub. Let's go home and I'll microwave you some nice
roaches.
-- The perfect evening in perspective, 

[End of Act Three.  Time: 21'31"]

In a bold move that has stunned Hollywood insiders, newly-divorced
comeback-kid Troy McClure has turned down the supporting lead in McBain
IV to direct and star in his own pet project: The Contrabulous
Fabtraption of Professor Horatio Hufnagel. Will the gambit pay off? 20th
Century Fox is betting... it will.

 EPISODE TITLE: Bart on the Road


EPISODE SUMMARY:  {bjr}

It's springtime, and everyone's fancy turns lightly to thoughts of
Spring Break.  Principal Skinner is no exception.

Ah, Spring Break in Hong Kong; custom-made suits at slave labor prices.  
-- Principal Skinner, 

But the airline apparently screwed up... they tacked on an aisle
seat, a kosher meal, and changed the time from Saturday to Friday
morning.  He calls the airline company, but the time change will cost
$7830.  "G.M. Chrysler, I can't afford that!" he yells.  But thinks
of a plan to close school early...

   Bart: [reading from a handout] Go To Work With Your Parents Day?
Skinner: [over the P.A.] Yes, Go To Work With Your Parents Day.
	 Tomorrow you will learn by doing and apply your knowledge of
	 fractions and gym to real-world situations.
-- Well, with the computers and all, 

Bart decides to apply his fraction and gym know-how to the task of
watching television.

Lisa: I still don't understand why you get to stay home and watch mom
      work.
Bart: Because I've always been an advocate of women in the workplace,
      Lis.  I can't help it if my mom's workplace contains our TV.
-- All the benefits you need, 

Marge: Lisa, you'll have a fine time at the plant with dad.  You've
       been interested in nuclear power for years.
 Lisa: I signed numerous petitions to shut down that plant.
Marge: Well, there you go.
-- 

 Bart: Mom, you're blocking the TV.  If you need something to do, you
       can fill out my form -- here.  [hands Marge the form]
Marge: [reading] Parent's occupation ... please note, homemaker is not
       allowed, as it is not real work, that's why you don't get paid
       for it ... ohhh.
-- Nothing like being appreciated at work, 

Lisa suggests that Bart take her place, but Marge points out that
he wanted to see women in the workplace, so Lisa deviously suggests
the DMV with the Gruesome Twosome.  Bart is shocked by this.

The DMV proves to be as bad as Bart had feared.

Patty: Some days, we don't let the line move at all.
Selma: We call those weekdays.  [the gruesome twosome laugh]
Patty: Good one.
-- In the weekends we're closed, 

At that moment, Mr. Van Houten is taking his son on a tour of the
factory.  Its array of equipment -- atomic dough maker, robot
stirrers, and other gadgetry -- would make Willie Wonka jealous.
Milhouse is duly impressed.  He discovers how crackers get salted
(in a ridiculous fashion, too).

Lisa discovers that atomic power isn't quite as thrilling as cracker
production.

Homer: Donut?
 Lisa: No, thanks.  Do you have any fruit?
Homer: [offers some of the donut he's eating] This has purple stuff
       inside.  Purple is a fruit.
-- Mmm, purple, 

Homer: Oh!  This is a map of nuclear sites around the country.  As a
       safety inspector, I'm responsible for changing most of these
       light bulbs.
 Lisa: Why are there so many burnt-out ones?
Homer: 'Cause they won't hire me an assistant.
-- I'm already overworked as the safety whatchamajigger, 
     

Martin's dad shows his son what he does for a living, being a
stockbroker.  Martin makes a million on soy futures but loses it all
but $600.

At the power plant, things just drag on.

I guess watching me isn't any more exciting than being me.
-- Homer (a little metahumor for y'all), 

 Lisa: Maybe we can make your job more fun.
	[points to two radiation suits hanging on the wall] 
       What are those?
Homer: I dunno.
-- How the devil should I know, I just work here, 

Homer and Lisa decide to play astronaut, using the radiation suit to
augment their wardrobe.  Lisa and Homer play "Homer 13" on the swivel
chairs.

Boy, this is a lot more fun with a second person.
-- Homer J. Simpson at work, 

Back at the DMV, Selma takes Cletus' driver's license picture.  A
nearby machine reproduces the photo, along with some identifying
information.  Selma grabs the new license off the device.

I just gotta go laminate your license; you'll get it in two to three
weeks.
-- Quick service at the DMV, 

Bart goes to shut off the machine, but then gets an idea.  He takes
a moment to straighten his hair, sits in front of the camera, and
takes his photo.  In a few seconds, Bart realizes one of his long-
term goals:  He has a fake ID.

Bart shows his new ID to Nelson and Milhouse.

Milhouse: Twenty-five years old?  You're not twenty-five years old.
	  This ID is completely fake!
    Bart: Yes, you're right Milhouse.  [takes ID back] It is a fake,
	  which makes it a fake ID.
Milhouse: A fake ID?  Cool!
-- Well, duh, 

"And it's our ticket to the best spring break of our lives!", Bart
announces.  And it begins with a ticket to an R-rated movie --
"Naked Lunch".

I can think of at least two things wrong with that title.
-- Nelson after watching "Naked Lunch", 

The boys stop by Moe's tavern.  Moe checks Bart's license, and after
discovering that he's 25, allows the boys to purchase beers.  But a
quick peek at the tavern drunks makes them reconsider.  The threesome
head out.

After leaving the bar, they ponder their next move outside.

Milhouse: [yells] Spring breeeak!  Yeah!
	  [pause, then quiet] Well, when _are_ we going to get rowdy?
Bart:     Maybe when we find something decent to do with this ID.
Nelson:   We could go rent a carpet shampooer.
-- Bart and his fake ID, 

Martin and his mechanical dog Flipsy come up, and Martin shares the
fact that he won $600 at the stock market.  Bart doesn't see the
point at first, but quickly catches on.

Bart, Milhouse, Nelson and Martin hit the streets in a rented white
Crown Victoria.

 Martin: [to his flipping dog] Oh boy, Flipsy!  You and I are going on
	 a road trip.
	  [Nelson grabs Martin and tosses Flipsy out the window]
	  [Flipsy gets run over by a car]
Nelson:   HA-ha!
-- Well, maybe just I, then, 

[End of Act One.  Time: 6'06"] 

Bart puts "Operation: Spring Break" into effect.  He gives out
envelopes containing alibis for a one-week road trip.

    Bart: [handing out envelopes] Gentlemen, for our road trip I have
	  taken the liberty of preparing an airtight and utterly
	  plausible alibi for use on our parents.
	   [Milhouse at home...]
Milhouse: I have been selected to represent the school at the national
	  grammar rodeo at the Sheraton Hotel in Canada.
	   [Martin at home...]
Martin:   I've been selected to represent the school at the national
	  grammar rodeo at the Sheraton Hotel in Canada.
	   [Nelson at home...]
Nelson:   [leaving his house] I'm goin' away for a week.  See ya!
-- Well, not plausible for Nelson,           

...and finally, Bart.

Marge: The national grammar rodeo?  I wish I were going.  Oh, wait,
       wait; I wish I _was_ going.  Is that right, Bart?
 Bart: I dunno.
 Lisa: It's not fair.  I'm the best student in school, how come I
       never heard about this competition?
 Bart: Maybe because you are, as we say in Latin, a "dorkus malorkus."
 Lisa: That's not Latin.  [to Marge] Mom, Bart's faking it.
Marge: Lisa, you've had your glory.  Now it's Bart's turn.
-- Bart's alibi for the road trip, 

Aerial shot of Bart's car riding down a highway, flanked by tall
cornfields on each side.  The camera circles around the car as the
radio plays "Radar Love."  Milhouse eagerly plays with the fader and
balance knobs on the radio, which does odd things with the sound.

	   [Milhouse fiddles with knobs before getting a whap in the
          head from Nelson]
Milhouse: Ow!  Bart, Nelson hit me.
Bart:     He sure did.
-- And it was a good one at that, 

A cup holder!  Bart, we've got to stop and get a cup!
-- Milhouse discovers the glove compartment, 

Milhouse sees the driver's seat empty.  "Bart?"  Bart visits his
chums at the back, thanks to cruise control and a hideous urban
legend.  But the car drives through a cornfield before the foursome
know it.

Meanwhile, back at the power plant, Homer gets around to changing
the light bulbs in his map.  He is bored to the core, but gets an
idea on a glance at the radiation suit.

The phone rings at the Simpson house.

Marge: [answering phone] Hello?  Oh, Homey, hello!  I can't remember
       the last time you called me from wor-- oh, you want to speak
       with Lisa.
	[Lisa picks up the phone]
Homer: Hi Lisa, how's your spring break going?
 Lisa: I'm learning about owls.
Homer: Oh, owls, eh?  So you probably wouldn't want to spend another
       day at work with me.
 Lisa: Sure I would.  I can always learn about owls this summer at
       bird camp.
-- Unless they break out and go mad, 

Bart's car rejoins the road after its short tour of America's
cornfields.

  Martin: [wakes up and looks out the window] Oh!  We've arrived in
	  the vast cornfields of Canada.  How much further to the
	  grammar rodeo?
  Nelson: Grammar rodeo?  We're going to a grammar rodeo?
    Bart: We're not going to a grammar rodeo.  That was just an
	  alibi, Milton.
Milhouse: [whispers] Martin.
    Bart: Martin.
-- Whoopsy-doodle, 

"Where _are_ we going?", Martin asks.  Bart quickly pulls over.

Well, I realize it's trite, but we could tour the bridges of Madison
County.
-- Martin's road trip plans, 

Hey, who has better vacation ideas than AAA?
 [reading a guidebook]
According to the publisher of this AAA guidebook, no one.
-- Milhouse's road trip plans, 

I've always wanted to see Macon, Georgia.
-- Nelson's road trip plans, 

Milhouse: Wait!  How about a fair?  Not just a county fair, not just a
	  Europe fair, but a World's fair -- the World's Fair in
	  Knoxville, Tennessee.
    Bart: Keep reading.
Milhouse: The Hungarians have built a giant motorized Rubik's cube, and
	  the fair's symbol is the SunSphere, which sits atop a 266-
	  foot tall steel shaft.
    Bart: What's inside?
Milhouse: An information desk.
   B+N+M:  Cooool!
-- After all, we do live in the information age, 

"It's a choice between Disneyworld and Knoxville," Bart notes.  But
of course, the foursome is hyped up for Knoxville.  And off they go in
a cloud of dust!

Lisa arrives at the plant.

Homer: You made it!  You have any trouble getting past the security
       guards?
 Lisa: Security guards?
-- At the nuclear power plant, 

Homer and Lisa get lunch, courtesy of one of SNPP's vending machines.

The way I figure it, if the candy stays in the machine for more than a
year, it's up for grabs.
-- Homer and his rules, 

Lisa sticks it to the man, and Homer shakes it.  Success!   A heap of
year-old candy falls to their feet.  They are caught by Smithers,
however.

Smithers: [walks up] Simpson!  What in God's name are you--
    Lisa: [offers Smithers some candy] Zagnut bar, Mr. Smithers?
	  Razzles?  Skittles?  Whachamacallit?  Twizzlers?
   Homer: They all have hilarious names and are delicious.
Smithers: Well I am partial to Jolly Ranchers. 
	   [takes one and eats it]
	  Good work, Simpson.
	   [walks a few steps, then looks back]
	  Simpsons.  [walks off]
-- The hilariouser the name, the deliciouser the candy,
     

On the road, we meet a man traveling in a station wagon with his
family.  He has had about all he can take from his rowdy kids.
"If you kids can't keep your hands to yourselves," he yells, "I'm
gonna turn this car around, and there'll be no Cape Canaveral for
anybody!"  The kids instantly quiet down, but Bart's car travels by,
and Nelson, seeing that the window is open, slaps the man on the
head.  "That's it!" he yells.  "Back to Winnipeg!"  And makes good
his so-called idle threat.  Bart turns out to be a more accommodating
driver than the man from Winnipeg.

    Martin: Bart, can we stop for ice cream?
      Bart: Yes.
	     [a little later, the boys all have cones]
    Nelson: Bart, can we weigh the car at that weigh station?
      Bart: Yeah.
	     [a little later]
  Milhouse: Bart, can we pick up that hitchhiker?
      Bart: I don't see why not.
	     [a little later, a disheveled hitchhiker rides between
            Martin and Nelson]
Hitchhiker: Bart, can we stop for ice cream?
      Bart: Yes.
	     [a little later, they all have cones again]
Hitchhiker: Well, I don't think I was rehabilitated, but I guess they
	    needed the extra bed.
-- No orange shoes, I hope, 

That night at home, Marge gets things ready for Lisa's overnight
stay at the plant.  She packs clothes for her.

Marge: With Bart gone and now you with your father, I'm not going to
       have anyone to --
 Lisa: [75 RPM] Thanks mom, bye!
	[runs out the door]
Marge: -- talk to.
-- Marge the empty-nester, 

The gang rolls into America's most family-friendly town.  (Well,
assuming your family is white, Christian, and doesn't like listening
to music recorded after 1952.)

Nelson: What is this place?
Bart:   Branson, Missouri.  My dad says it's like Vegas -- if it were
	run by Ned Flanders.
Nelson: [sees a sign extolling the virtues of an Andy Williams
         concert]
	Andy Williams!
  Bart: Aw, we don't need to stop here.
Nelson: Yes we do.  [punches Bart in the back of the head]
-- Point well taken, 

Mr. Williams' vocal stylings have a varied effect on the boys.
Bart, Martin, and Milhouse are fast asleep.  Nelson, however, is
enthralled.

Andy Williams: [singing off-camera]
	       ...my huckleberry friend
	       Moon river, and me.
	       [audience applauds]
       Nelson: I didn't think he'd do "Moon River," but then -- bam! --
	       second encore!
-- Nelson and Williams - who knew?, 

Homer and Lisa gather around a roaring fire of technical manuals,
and play a classic sleepover game.

 Lisa: Okay, time for truth or dare.  You go first.
Homer: Ehh, truth.  Ask me anything.
 Lisa: Who do you love most:  me, Bart, or Maggie?
Homer: D'oh!  All right, dare.
-- Didn't we settle this at the hockey game?, 

Cut to Homer on the phone.

Homer: Hello, I'd like to speak with a Mr. Snotball, first name Ura.
  Moe: Ura Snotball?
Homer: What?  How dare you?  If I find out who this is, I'll staple a
       flag to your butt and mail you to Iran.  [hangs up]
-- The shoe is on the other foot, eh?, 

Homer: ... Your turn.
 Lisa: Hmm, truth.
Homer: Uh, do you have a crush on anyone?
 Lisa: Dad!
Homer: I , oh, I won't tell anybody.
 Lisa: Dad, you tell everybody everything.  Even Moe knew when I
       threw up on the dentist.
-- Way to get Marge pregnant, 

 Lisa: Okay.  I like... Langdon Alger.
Homer: I have no idea who that is.
-- Homer and Lisa play `Truth or Dare', 

"Nobody does," Lisa confesses.  "He's very quiet and enjoys puzzles."
But Lisa warns Homer not to tell anyone, but Homer's forgotten his
name already.  Lisa says, "This is the best spring break ever!"

Not for Marge it isn't.  She sits alone, watching late-night TV.

... and with my patented seminar, you will learn to corner the real
estate market through hypnosis.  Why waste your hypnotic powers on
neighbors and coworkers when...
-- I Can't Believe They Hypnotized Me, 

Marge can stands no more and forlornly looks into Lisa's room, and
then Bart's.  Finally, she walks into Maggie's room.  The baby is
fast asleep.  Marge quietly coughs twice.  Maggie doesn't notice, so
Marge gently pokes her.  Maggie stays asleep.  Marge pokes again, a
little more forcefully, which wakes Maggie.  She objects to this rude
awakening -- loudly.  Marge comforts Maggie, and comforts herself by
this.

The next day, the boys reach the Tennessee border.  "Next stop, the
Knoxville World's Fair", Milhouse says, "and its fabulous SunSphere."
Soon, the SunSphere looms over the horizon.  At last, our heroes
have arrived.  The boys fan out over the fairgrounds, which look like
they have seen better days.  Unfortunately, the place is a wreck, and
any sign of a Fair is nowhere to be seen.  Seeing a wig store nearby,
Bart talks to the man out front.  "Is this the World's Fair visitors
center?"  Unfortunately, the foursome have fallen prey to the
outdated AAA guidebook -- 14 years outdated, in fact.  They also
discover that the Sunsphere is now the Wigsphere.  Then the man
asks if the boys are gonna buy some wigs...

The boys -- newly be-wigged -- sit at the curb to consider recent
events.  Bart takes solace in the fact that they still have the car
and the wad of cash, but Martin spent the last ten dollars on a
talking Al Gore doll.  ("You are hearing me talk...")  Nelson,
angrily, throws a rock at the Sunsphere, which topples, and crushes
their car.

    Bart: We got no car!
  Martin: We got no money!
Milhouse: And no one knows we're here!
 B+Ma+Mi: We're stranded!
  Nelson: But on the plus side, I knocked over the SunSphere.
	   [camera cuts back to wider angle]
	   HA-ha.
-- ...and crushed a new car, too!  

[End of Act Two.  Time: 15'54"]

With their car as flat as their wallets, the boys go to plan B.  The
first step:  figuring out what plan B is.  Nelson wishes they'd gone
to Macon, Georgia, but Bart has other plans.

The boys try to get some spending money at a pawn shop.

	     [at a pawn shop, Nelson grabs Milhouse's glasses]
  Milhouse: Hey!  I need those to see.
Pawnbroker: Ah, these lenses are perfect!  Now I can re-bottom those
	    antique Coke bottles.
	     [opens the cash register, and begins counting out some
            money]
	    Three hundred, four hundred, five hundred, six hundred...
  Milhouse: Hey!  Come back!  hey! 
	     [crashes into the pyramid of Coke bottles]
	    Ow.
Pawnbroker: [putting money back] ...five hundred, four hundred, three
	    hundred, two hundred, one hundred, zero.
-- Stranded in Tennessee with no money or glasses, 

Time for Plan C -- hop an outbound freight train headed for that
helluva town, Springfield.  The guys throw their bags in an open
boxcar.  Just as they are about to hop on, the train speeds up and
heads to Springfield without them.  Nelson is a little more
persistent and continues running after the train.  He rejoins the
group after he realizes he can't catch it.

At home, Marge answers another phone call.  She's happy that Bart
is calling her, but he wants to speak to Lisa.  Bart 'fesses up and
tells Lisa of their plight.  Lisa has several suggestions.

       [on phone with Bart]
Lisa: Hmmm -- you could travel for free if you were a stewardess.
       [pause]
      Well, how badly do you want to get home?  All right, all right,
      how about a courier, they travel for free, too.
       [pause]
      No, that's a terrier.  They're dogs.
-- Ruff ruff, anyone order a Bart dog?, 

Bart decides to go with the courier idea.

Well, you sure don't look 25, but your unlaminated, out-of-state
driver's license is proof enough for me.
-- Dispatcher at a courier service to Bart, 

Bart's first assignment takes him to exotic Hong Kong.  He hauls a
cooler labeled "HUMAN EYES" off the plane, and brings it to a man in
a white lab coat.  They respond to each other in Chinese.  Skinner,
still on his spring break, spots them.

Back in Knoxville, things aren't working as planned.  Milhouse wants
to call their parents, but Bart calls Lisa instead and tells her that
he needs to courier something large to Springfield, but something
like that is out of the Simpson's price range.  The dispatcher gives
Bart a job couriering 5,000 Big Macs to Marlon Brando, and Bart
says "I can't take much more of this.  I'm counting on you, Lise."
And hangs up.  That night, Lisa gets little sleep over her concern
for her brother.  Her preoccupation prevents her from enjoying
another day with Homer.  Even a little chair-spinning doesn't pick
her up.

Homer: What's wrong, honey?
 Lisa: There's something troubling me, dad, but I don't think I can
       tell you because it's a secret.
Homer: Ah, you don't have to tell me, but I thought we trusted each
       other with our secrets now.  I mean, I haven't told a soul
       about your boyfriend.
 Lisa: Langdon Alger?  Oh, I don't like him anymore.  
-- I was frustrated by his puzzledom, 

 Lisa: Okay, but you gotta promise you won't get mad or tell anyone,
       especially Bart.
Homer: I promise.
 Lisa: [Jenna von Oy-esque] Bart rented a car with a phony driver's
       license and drove Milhouse, Martin, and Nelson to a week out in
       Knoxville and their car got crushed and they're out of money and
       they can't get home and Bart's working as a courier and just
       came back from Hong Kong!
Homer: [face reddens, then returns to normal]  Yes, that's a real
       pickle.  Could you excuse me for a moment?
	[puts on the radiation suit hood, which muffles his voice]
	[yells his head off as the faceplate fogs up]  
-- I promised I _would_ get mad,           

Homer: All right, I have thought this through.  I will send Bart the
       money to fly home, then I will murder him.
 Lisa: No, no!  Then he'll know I told.  
-- Someone took a bite out of the Rice Krispie square,
     

Homer calms down further and asks Lisa for the location of Knoxville.
"It's in Tennessee", she says, further elaborating that it's next to
the birthplace of the atomic bomb, Oak Ridge Nuclear Facility.  They
deduce that Homer could order something from Oak Ridge and get Bart
to courier it.  Homer calls Oak Ridge and orders his own workstation,
a T-437 Safety Command Console.  The technician checks his computer
to see that it's operational, but Homer ends this by pouring Buzz
Cola all over it.  The technician overly exaggerates his concern.
Homer sends it care of Langdon Alger.

Bart accompanies his friends home.  They aren't enjoying the trip as
much as he is.  Milhouse could use another air hole, but Bart hushes
him.  "They'll know you're in there", he tells Milhouse.  The camera
pulls back to reveal that Bart and the crate are the only things in
the plane's cargo hold.  Bart turns another page in his comic, and
laughs.

Safe at home, Bart makes up an excuse about not returning to the
grammar rodeo next year.  Homer and Lisa are understandably ticked,
but sweet, naive Marge is ever-smiling.

Mr. and Mrs. Simpson retire for the day.  Before they can go to bed,
the phone rings.

Marge: [answering] Hello?  Oh hello, Principal Skinner.  No, Bart
       has never been to Hong Kong.  Good night.
	[hangs up]
	[the phone rings again]
       [answering] Hello?  Tennessee State Police?  No, my son's car
       was not crushed in Knoxville.  I don't know where to begin
       telling you what's wrong with that.
	[hangs up]  
	[the phone rings again]
       [answering] Hello?  No, Bart is not available tomorrow to
       deliver a human kidney to Amsterdam.
	[Homer, who has dived under the covers, snorts]
       Homer, are you laughing at me?
-- Postscript to

 EPISODE TITLE: 22 Short Films About Springfield


EPISODE SUMMARY:  {bjr}

It's a bright spring day in Springfield.  Bart and Milhouse are
enjoying a little patented spitting off the overpass.

    Bart: Milhouse, do you ever think about the people in those cars?
Milhouse: I try not to.  It makes it harder to spit on 'em.
-- Spit victims are people too,
     "Twenty-Two Short Films About Springfield"

Bart wonders whether anything interesting happens to people in
Springfield, but Milhouse was distracted by a convertible aching for
a mustard-squirting.

C'mon, it's eleven o'clock -- I need some sugar.
-- Bart, "Twenty-Two Short Films About Springfield"

Bart and Milhouse stroll over to the Kwik-E-Mart for their sugar
fix.  In the store, Sanjay attempts to invite Apu to his party.

Sanjay: I wish you'd come to my party, Apu.  You could use some
        merriment.
   Apu: Listen, serving the customer is merriment enough for me.
         [Bart pays for his gum]
        Thank you, come again.  You see?  Most enjoyable.
Sanjay: Oh, I guarantee a wingding of titanic proportions.  You will
        be there or kindly be square.
   Apu: Well, I don't like to leave the store...
         [dusts off a "back in 5 minutes" sign]
        ...but for the next five minutes I'm going to party like it's
        on sale for 19.99.
-- The Proprietor Formerly Known as Apu, 
     "Twenty-Two Short Films About Springfield"

Apu and Sanjay run from the store at breakneck speed to Sanjay's
party central.

Apu: [grabs a tofu dog off the grill]  Quick, quick, no time to cook
     them -- they will plump in my stomach.
      [quickly eats the hot dog]
      [drinks some beer quickly and burps]
      [spots a pretty woman]    
     Hello, beautiful.  No ring, I see.  So you are only arranged to be
     married.
      ["Freakazoid" plays on the stereo]
     Ooh, ooh, ooh, I love this song.  Let us boogie.
      [grabs the girl, and sings along]
     I am a Freak-a-zoid, come on and wind me up... Ooh, I am hot.  Let
     us get out of here.
      [Apu and the woman retire to a changing house]   
      [Apu leaves, clothes askew and smoking]
     Don't worry, I'll tell everybody you were untouchable!
      [backs into the pool, dragging the other guests along with him in
       a domino fashion]
     Oh Sanjay, never have I partied so hearty.  Same time next year,
     no? [gives Sanjay a high-five]
A+S: Yeah!
-- Apu Nahasapeemapetilan, party machine,
     "Twenty-Two Short Films About Springfield"

Apu runs back to the store with one minute to spare, and Hans Moleman
chides him for making him waste four minutes of his life.  He wants
them back... but reconsiders when he knows he'd only waste them.

Meanwhile, in another part of town, Marge is listening to the radio
while cleaning out the kitchen sink.

"Swing Serenade" is brought to you by Gorman's Ear Guards.
GUARD YOUR EARS! -- with Gorman's.
-- A radio ad, "Twenty-Two Short Films About Springfield"

Lisa asks Marge if she can recycle a beer can.  "Why not?", she says.
Lisa walks out to the front curb, and tosses the can in a recycling
bin.  Bart skateboards by, and, not seeing Lisa there, tosses his
used bubble gum in the vicinity of the bin.  The sticky mass lands in
Lisa's hair.  She tries to pull the gum out, but with little success.

 Lisa: Mom, someone threw gum in my hair.
Marge: Are you sure?  Maybe it's just shampoo.  That washes right out.
-- I doubt it, "Twenty-Two Short Films About Springfield"

But it _is_ gum, and it's pulling Lisa's hair out.

Wait, if I remember my Heloise, the trick to getting out gum... is
peanut butter.
-- Marge, a little rusty on her mothering,
     "Twenty-Two Short Films About Springfield"
          
But it won't budge.  So Marge adds some mayonnaise and tells Lisa to
go out and sit in the sun.  Sulky, Lisa concurs.  A lone bee flies
near Lisa's hair.  She waves it off.  The bee comes back with its
buddies, and they descend on Lisa's head.

As she runs screaming around the back yard, one bee breaks off from
the pack.  The camera shifts to a bee's-eye view.  It flies past
Skinner, Bart (still skateboarding), and the Bee Guy.  Finally, it
alights on Smithers, who is pedaling Burns around on a bicycle built
for two.

   Burns: [looking up from his magazine]  Smithers, what's the meaning
          of this slacking off?
Smithers: Uh, there's a bee in my eye, sir.
   Burns: And?
Smithers: I, I'm allergic to bee stings.  They cause me to, uh, die.
   Burns: But we're running out of forward momentum.
Smithers: Uh, perhaps you could pedal for just a little while, sir?
   Burns: Quite impossible.  I could try to bat him off if you like.
           [tries, feebly]
Smithers: Uh, really, that's o-- [the bee stings Smithers, who slumps
          over the handlebars]
   Burns: Holy cats, man!  We're starting to wobble.
Smithers: [heavily slurred]  Get ... me ... to ... a ... hospital ...
          you ... have ... to ... pedal.
   Burns: Oh, Tuttle's Sunday trousers.  Fear not, I'll get you to a
          hospital -- the only way I know how.
          Smithers, you infernal ninny, stick your left hoof on that
          flange, now!  Now, if you can get it through your bug-addled
          brain, jam that second mephitic clodhopper of yours on the
          right doodad!  Now pump those scrawny chicken legs, you
          stuporous funker!
-- Burns and Smithers bikercise,
     "Twenty-Two Short Films About Springfield"

Burns and that "wretched shirkaday" Smithers arrive at the
hospital's entrance, where the two men collapse in a heap.  Two
orderlies spring out the door with a stretcher.  They pause to take
stock of the situation, then take Burns onto the stretcher and into
the hospital.  Dr. Nick Riviera walks by.

Smithers: [collapsed] Help... me.
 Riviera: Holy smokes, you need booze. [tosses him change]
-- Don't worry, he'll be back, 
     "Twenty-Two Short Films About Springfield"

Dr. Nick throws some change to Smithers, and walks inside the
hospital, and finds his way into a boardroom.

Riviera: Hi, everybody!
  Board: [unenthused]  Hi, Dr. Nick.
-- At a malpractice board hearing,
     "Twenty-Two Short Films About Springfield"

Chairman: Dr. Nick, this malpractice committee has received a few
          complaints against you.  [reads from clipboard]  Of the 160
          gravest charges, the most troubling are performing major
          operations with a knife and fork from a seafood restaurant.
 Riviera: But I cleaned them with my napkin.
Chairman: Misuse of the cadavers.
 Riviera: I get here earlier when I drive in the carpool lane.
-- "Twenty-Two Short Films About Springfield"

An orderly barges in, and yells that there's a crazy man with a
scalpel in E/R demanding to see a quack.  It's up to Dr. Nick.

The "crazy man" turns out to be Abe Simpson, holding off the
emergency room crowd.  Dr. Riviera asks "where is the trouble", and
Abe gives him a full load of symptons, which describe "bonus eruptus"
which is a disorder where the skeleton tries to leap out the mouth
and escape the body.  Abe's only hope is "transdental electromicide".
Dr. Riviera asks for a golf cart motor with a 1000 volt capacimator,
but the two-second hesitation pushes him past schedule.  Nick
improvises by ripping the cords from an operating lamp and shocking
the sh-- hell out of Abe.  "Keep doing that every five seconds",
the "doctor" instructs.  The malpractice charges are dropped, and
Dr. Nick enthuses "Free nose jobs for everyone!" starting with
Jasper, who wants a Van Heflin.

Dr. Nick leads Jasper off while Abe continues to receive trans-
dermal electromicide.  The treatment causes lights to flicker all
over town, including Moe's Tavern.

   Moe: Say, Barn, uh, remember when I said I'd have to send away to
        NASA to calculate your bar tab?
Barney: Oh ho, oh yeah, you had a good laugh, Moe.
   Moe: The results came back today.  
-- At Moe's Tavern, "Twenty-Two Short Films About Springfield"

   Moe: [reading a printout] You owe me seventy billion dollars.
Barney: Huh?
   Moe: No, wait, wait, wait, that's for the Voyager spacecraft.
-- Moe got NASA to calculate Barney's tab,
     "Twenty-Two Short Films About Springfield"
          
Barney's tab is fourteen billion dollars.

Snake bursts into the bar, and threatens to kill Barney if Moe
moves.  Apparently uncaring of his best customer, Moe leaps behind
an alcove in the wall behind three inches of bulletproof glass...
leaving Snake free to steal all the money from the register.  Moe
remains trapped within the alcove until air runs out.

[End of Act I.  Time: 7'33"]

Elsewhere in Springfield, Superintendent Chalmers walks up to the
door of a neatly-kept house.  Principal Skinner greets him there.
Chalmers just grunts as the two men go inside.  Skinner heads for
the kitchen, where he notices smoke billowing out from the stove.
The worst has happened -- the roast he has prepared is burnt.
Skinner, however, has an ace up his sleeve.  He plans to purchase
fast food from the Krusty Burger across the street and pass it as his
own cooking.  Skinner starts to climb out the window when Chalmers
suddenly comes into the kitchen.

Chalmers: Seymour!
 Skinner: Superintendent; I was just, uh, just stretching my calves on
          the windowsill.  Isometric exercise.  Care to join me?
Chalmers: Why is there smoke coming out of your oven, Seymour?
 Skinner: Uh, oh, that isn't smoke, it's steam.  Steam from the steamed
          clams we're having.  [rubs stomach] Mmm -- steamed clams.
-- Skinner and the Superintendent, 
     "Twenty-Two Short Films About Springfield"

Either Chalmers is satisfied with this explanation, or decides not
to pursue the matter further.  In any case, he goes back to the
dining room.  Skinner jumps out the window and runs over to the
Krusty Burger after Chalmers leaves.

A few minutes later, Skinner makes an entrance the dining room
carrying a big platter of Krusty Burgers.

 Skinner: Superintendent, I hope you're ready for mouth-watering
          hamburgers.
Chalmers: I thought we were having steamed clams.
 Skinner: Oh, no, I said, "steamed hams."  That's what I call
          hamburgers.
Chalmers: You call hamburgers steamed hams.
 Skinner: Yes, it's a regional dialect.
Chalmers: Uh-huh.  What region?
 Skinner: Uh, upstate New York.
Chalmers: Really.  Well, I'm from Utica and I never heard anyone use
          the phrase, "steamed hams."
 Skinner: Oh, not in Utica, no; it's an Albany expression.
Chalmers: I see.
-- Skinner and the Superintendent,
     "Twenty-Two Short Films About Springfield"

Chalmers suspends his disbelief long enough to enjoy some of
Skinner's steamed hams.

Chalmers: You know, these hamburgers are quite similar to the ones the
          have at Krusty Burger.
 Skinner: [laughs]  Oh, no, patented Skinner Burgers.  Old family
          recipe.
Chalmers: For steamed hams.
 Skinner: Yes.
Chalmers: Yes, and you call them steamed hams despite the fact that
          they are obviously grilled.  [shows Skinner the grill marks]
 Skinner: Uh ... you know ... one thing I sh-- ... 'scuse me for one
          second.
Chalmers: Of course.
-- Skinner and the Superintendent,
     "Twenty-Two Short Films About Springfield"

Skinner retires to the kitchen for a second.  When he walks back
into the dining room, we can see that the entire kitchen is in
flames.

 Skinner: [faking a yawn] Well, that was wonderful.  Good time was had
          by all.  I'm pooped.
Chalmers: Yes, I guess I should be --
           [notes entire kitchen is on fire]
          Good Lord, what is happening in there?
 Skinner: Aurora Borealis?
Chalmers: Aurora Borealis?  At this time of year?  A this time of day?
          In this part of the country?  Localized entirely within your
          kitchen?
 Skinner: Yes.
Chalmers: May I see it?
 Skinner: Oh, erm... No.
-- Skinner and Superintendent,
     "Twenty-Two Short Films About Springfield"

Skinner escorts Chalmers back outside.

   Agnes: [offscreen]  Seymour!  The house is on fire!
 Skinner: No, mother.  It's just the Northern Lights.
Chalmers: Well, Seymour, you are an odd fellow, but I must say you
          steam a good ham.
           [Chalmers walks off.  He looks back at Skinner, who flashes
            him the "thumbs-up" sign]
   Agnes: Help!  Help!
-- Skinner and the Superintendent, 
     "Twenty-Two Short Films About Springfield"

A fire engines rushes to the Skinners' rescue.  It rushes past
Homer, who is carrying Maggie, a bundle of groceries, and is holding
Santa's Little Helper's leash.  He notices a disturbing news story in
the "Springfield Shopper" kiosk -- Senator Helms (R-NC) is calling
for a tax on donuts.  (Mmmm ... taxable food item.)  Juggling the
baby, the groceries, and the dog, Homer pays for and gets his copy of
the paper.  ("Done, and done!")  He quickly realizes the mission
wasn't entirely successful -- somehow, Maggie got locked in the
kiosk!  He fishes in his pockets for another quarter, but the coins
are all stretched out because of his stop at the railroad tracks.
Rushing off to get change leaves Maggie overly upset, so Homer
stays and tries various techniques to save her, all unsuccessful,
until he stumbled on the solution.

Later, at the old Simpson place, we see Homer's clever solution.  He
unbolted the kiosk and carried it, Maggie and all, back to the baby's
crib.  There, they play a rousing game of peek-a-boo, with Maggie
using the paper as a screen, and babbles.  At a Krusty Burger,
Chief Wiggum also babbles as he enjoys a meat-flavored sandwich.

   Lou: You know, I went to the McDonald's in Shelbyville on Friday
        night --
Wiggum: [interrupting] The McWhat?
   Lou: Uh, the McDonald's.  I, I never heard of it either, but they
        have over 2,000 locations in this state alone.
 Eddie: Must've sprung up overnight.
-- Ignorance is bliss, "Twenty-Two Short Films About Springfield"
   
   Lou: You know, the funniest thing though; it's the little
        differences.
Wiggum: Example.
   Lou: Well, at McDonald's you can buy a Krusty Burger with cheese,
        right?  But they don't call it a Krusty Burger with cheese.
Wiggum: Get out!  Well, what do they call it?
   Lou: A Quarter Pounder with cheese.
Wiggum: Quarter Pounder with cheese?  Well, I can picture the cheese,
        but, uh, do they have Krusty partially gelatinated non-dairy
        gum-based beverages?
   Lou: Mm-hm.  They call 'em, "shakes."
 Eddie: Huh, shakes.  You don't know what you're gettin'.
-- Don't think you want to know,
     "Twenty-Two Short Films About Springfield"

Chief Wiggum wants to get some donuts, but finds himself stuck in
the booth.  Eddie and Lou deflate the booth and help Wiggum out.

As Wiggum leaves the Krusty Burger, Pedro the Bee Guy drives past.
The camera follows him home.  He kisses his wife and removes his
outfit.

Ay, que dia miserable a trabajo.
-- Pedro the Bumblebee Man, "Twenty-Two Short Films About Springfield"

Pedro's atrocities during the filming (or making) of the show include
getting attacked by a woodpecker, becoming electrically shocked with
spaghetti, and whacked with a giant baseball.

Pedro: Ah, tiempo para relaxar en paz y quieto.
        [opens a cabinet full of oranges which wallop his head]
       !Ay, naranjas en la cabeza!
        [flails about in his home until he finds himself stuck on
         a chandelier]
       !Ay, una candelabra precariosa!
        [the chandelier is pulled free of the ceiling; bringing the
         ceiling down with it]
 Emma: [walking down and seeing the disaster] !Ay!
       Mira que cosa tan terrible, yo no puedo entender algo como
       esto, como puedo vivir con un hombre tan irresponsible.
       !No, no, no, no no!
        [walks off, handing Pedro a divorce paper]
-- "Twenty-Two Short Films About Springfield"

Ay, ?donde esta mi tequila?
-- Pedro the Bumblebee Man, "Twenty-Two Short Films About Springfield"

The rest of the house crumbles.

Snake, on the lam from the bar heist, drives by.  He stops at an
intersection, and sees Wiggum cross in front of him, who
(surprisingly) recognizes him.  Fearing the jig is up, Snake floors
the accelerator.  Wiggum tumbles over the hood and roof of the car.
Snake hits a mailbox (sending a gusher of mail skyward) before ramming
 wall.

Hey, hey, wait up!  We gotta swap insurance info!
-- Chief Wiggum after a car crash,
     "Twenty-Two Short Films About Springfield"

Wiggum catches up with Snake, and the two men fight.  They barrel-
roll right into Herman's military antique store.  Herman greets the
two combatants with his shotgun, and holds them up.

A donut rolls out of Wiggum's box, out the door, and down the sewer.
The camera tracks it back to Evergreen Terrace, where Reverend
Lovejoy is walking a sheepdog.  He stops in front of Flanders' house.

Lovejoy: C'mon boy, this is the spot, right here.  That's a good boy,
         do your dirty sinful business.
    Ned: Well, howdy, Reverend Lovejoy.  Nice to see you there ... on
         my lawn ... with your dog.
Lovejoy: Oh, oh, ooh, bad dog!  Look at that, right on Ned's lawn.
         Now how could you do such a thing?
          [quietly to the dog] Good boy, don't stop now.
         Bad dog, I condemn you to Hell.
    Ned: Better get the old snow shovel back from Homer, eh?
          [leaves]
Lovejoy: [to dog]  Good boy, don't stop the music.
-- Revenge is a dish best served... um, hot,

Ned walks by the Simpsons' kitchen window, where Marge is squeezing
a grapefruit on Lisa's hair.

  Ned:  [notes Marge squeezing a grapefruit]
       Marge Simpson!  Still making juice the old-fashioned way?
        [actually, Marge is squeezing it on Lisa's hair]
 Lisa: No, I've got gum in my hair.
Marge: Oh, we've tried everything:  olive oil, lemon juice, tartar
       sauce, chocolate syrup, gravy, bacon fat, hummus and baba
       ganoush.
 Lisa: My scalp hurts from horsefly bites.
  Ned: Why don't you freeze it with an ice cube, and hit it with a
       hammer?  Works for me when I get bubbly-gum in the old push-
       broom.
-- The Eternal Question of Gum in One's Hair,
     "Twenty-Two Short Films About Springfield"

Later, Ned bangs away at Lisa's hair on the kitchen table.
Unfortunately, all this does is flatten the gum out, mashing more
hair into the gum.  Everyone in town seems to want to take a bash at
solving this precarious problem, including Groundskeeper Willie,
Lionel Hutz, and the Capital City Goofball.

[End of Act II.  Time: 16'22"]

Time for another show-within-a-show, this time featuring our
favorite bumpkin.

Hey, what's going on on this side?
-- Cletus pokes his head through a TV cue card,
     "Twenty-Two Short Films About Springfield"

Brandine is doing some of her daily chores.  Cletus walks in,
carrying a pair of black shoes.

  Cletus: Hey, Brandine!  You might could wear these to your job
          interview.
Brandine: And scuff up the topless dancin' runway?  Naw, you best bring
          'em back from where you got 'em.
-- Cletus the Slack-Jawed Yokel,
     "Twenty-Two Short Films About Springfield"

Cletus shimmies up a telephone pole, and tosses the shoes out on the
wire.

         [on top of a telephone pole]
Cletus: Hey you know what?  I could call my ma while I'm up here.
        [yelling] Hey, maw!  Get off the dang roof!
-- Cletus the Slack-Jawed Yokel,
     "Twenty-Two Short Films About Springfield"

The camera follows the phone wire back into The Android's Dungeon.
There, the owner is sending out for food.  Just when he completes
his order, Milhouse walks in with a potty emergency.  ("I'm gonna
explode!")  He must purchase something to use the bathroom, so
Milhouse gets with his three quarters a Hamburglar Adventure.
Milhouse pays for the comic.  Just then, his dad comes into the
store.  Mr. Van Houten returns for his kid and finds him buying
comic books.  Milhouse is dragged away.

Meanwhile at Herman's Military Antiques Shop, Herman has restrained
Chief Wiggum and Snake in bondage gear, and discusses their near
future.  "As soon as Zed gets here, the party will begin."  The door
buzzes, but it's not Zed, just those wacky Van Houtens.  Milhouse
still needs to use the bathroom, so Herman tells him to make it
quick.  Over Chief Wiggum and Snake's muffled protests, Mr. VH
reminisces about how the store used to be a pet shop.  But Herman
will have none of it.  "Get in the corner," he orders.  But soon
afterward, he's whacked on the head with a mace... the ball-and-
chain kind.  He's also wearing a helmet.  Milhouse wants to buy
this ensemble, then notices Herman unconscious on the floor.

Wiggum uses the moment to hop out on his chair.  Outside, he crosses
paths with Lisa.  She steps in the Snippy Longstocking barbershop,
and gets into the chair.  She gets her gummy hair cut into a nice-
looking style.

I finally look like a real person!
-- Lisa, "Twenty-Two Short Films About Springfield" (meta-humor alert)

Nelson does appreciate Lisa's new look -- he laughs at her ("HA-
ha!").  Lisa sighs and replaces her wool hat.  Mrs. Glick walks by,
trips on the curb, and winds up head-first in a trash can.  Nelson
laughs at this, too.  An extremely tall man drives past in a VW
Beetle, scrunched up so his knees almost bang into his head.  Nelson
laughs.  This proves to be his undoing.  The man pulls over, unfolds
himself from the car, and pursues Nelson.  Realizing his predicament
("Crud.") Nelson runs off.  The man rounds the corner, but sees only
Lisa, and an open manhole.  Of course, the manhole is where Nelson
is hiding.

Wadlow: [lifts Nelson out of the sewer by his head]
         Do you find something comical about my appearance when I'm
         driving my automobile?
Nelson: Yeah.
Wadlow: Everyone needs to drive a vehicle, even the very tall.
         [turns Nelson to face the car] 
        This was the largest auto that I could afford.  Am I therefore
        to be made the subject of fun?
Nelson: I guess so.
-- Nelson, unclear on the concept, 
     "Twenty-Two Short Films About Springfield"

The tall guy forces Nelson to march down Main Street, pants down.  
He drives slowly behind the ashamed bully.

Wadlow: Hey, everybody!  Look at this -- it's that boy who laughs at
        everyone.  [Nelson]  Let's laugh at him!
 Crowd: HA-ha!
-- Stupid poetic justice, "Twenty-Two Short Films About Springfield"

Ketchup and mustard rain down on Nelson.  From the bridge, Bart and
Milhouse laugh at him.  Bart still remembers his comment from about
21 minutes and 10 seconds ago, and Milhouse agrees.  "Everybody in
town's got their story to tell."  Bart notes, "There's just not
enough time to hear them all."

As if on cue, Professor John Frink tries to get in a funny story
of his own... but he's too late.  The camera fades out on the poor
professor, even as he tries to sing his monkey-written theme song.

 EPISODE TITLE: "The Curse of the Flying Hellfish"


EPISODE SUMMARY:  {fb}

In occasion of Springfield Elementary's Grandparents' Day, "A Low-
Cost Outing For Seniors", every child has brought one of his
grandparents to school. Of course, Bart is stuck with Abe, who has
found a new habit in spitting on the floor.

 Abe: [spits]
Bart: Grampa! I don't mind when you spit at home, but I have to work
      with these people.
 Abe: Oh, jabberjack. Schoolhouse don't put up spittoons, I ain't
      responsible. [spits]
-- A serious lack in our educational system,
      

All right, seniors, we'd all love to share in your wisdom, experience,
yadda yadda yadda.
-- Mrs. Krabappel shows her deepest interest,
      

     Mrs.K: Let's start with Milhouse's grandfather.
Van Houten: Uh, how many of you have a house?
             [children raise their hands]
Van Houten: All right, now how many of you drove your house to school
            today?
             [children raise their hands again, then wake up]
  Children: Huh?
Van Houten: Well, I did. [chuckles] No, I'm not Superman; I just own an
            RV. Me and the new wife travel the country searching for
            adventure. Last fall, we won a chili cook-off in Beaumont,
            Texas.
  Children: Wow!
-- More excitement than any videogame,
      

"You're living in a fool's paradise, Van Houten," Abe criticizes.
"If you fell down in the shower, that thing would be your tomb."
But Bart turns Abe's attention back to spitting.

 Muntz: [chuckles] No, I'm not Superman; I'm a judge. Why, just this
        morning I sentenced my 46th man to death. Oh... no, 47th.
Nelson: Wow, 47! I love you Grandpa.
-- I reached him, 

But Abe just can't shut up...

Yeah... well, I may not have a fancy black bathrobe and a hammer like
Snooty, but I do have slippers and an oatmeal spoon. Look!
-- Abe vs. Judge Muntz, 

Mrs. Krabappel invites Abe to come up front and "give someone else a
chance to interrupt" over Bart's protests.  "About time, knothead,"
Abe grumbles.

The storyteller comes in front of the class, and urges everybody to
shut up.

   Abe: Now, my story begins in 19-dickety-two. We had to say "dickety"
        'cause that Kaiser had stolen our word "twenty". I chased that
        rascal to get it back, but gave up after dickety-six miles...
         [children laughing]
Martin: "Dickety"? Highly dubious!
   Abe: What're you cackling at, fatty? Too much pie, that's your
        problem!
         [children laughing]
   Abe: Now, I'd like to digress from my prepared remarks to discuss
        how I invented the terlet.
 Mrs.K: "Terlet"? Hah!
         [children laughing]
   Abe: Stop your snickerin'! I spent three years on that terlet!
-- Well, duh, 

But it's no use; he's just making a fool of himself and Bart. At
home, comes supper time, Bart complains about it to the family.

 Bart: And then, he claimed he was the one who turned cats and dogs
       against each other. Why is he always making up those crazy
       stories?
Homer: Maybe it's time we put Grampa in a home.
 Lisa: You already put him in a home.
 Bart: Maybe it's time we put him in one where he can't get out.
-- What about cryogenics?, 

 Lisa: Old people deserve our respect. Look at Jacques Cousteau and
       Goldie Hawn; you wouldn't shut them away like second-class
       citizens.
Homer: Pftt... second class? What about social security, bus discounts,
       Medic-Alert jewelry, Gold Bond powder, pants all the way up to
       your armpits, and all those other senior perks? Oh, if you ask
       me, old folks have it pretty sweet.
-- 

But at Springfield's Retirement Castle, life doesn't always hold that
much excitement, as Abe has nothing else to do but read his mail,
which is nothing else than a bunch of flyers.

"Consider burial at... Sea World!"
-- 

Eh, this junk was hardly worth getting up for. Maybe if I go back to
sleep for a few days some good mail will build up.
-- 

As Abe ponders this option, he notices an envelope. The letter is
from the Fighting Hellfish, and says only one thing: "Asa Phelps has
died."  This comes as shocking news to Abe: "The 7th Hellfish is
dead?! That means the fortune's almost mine..."

At Asa's funeral ceremony, Abe is the only one present, until
Montgomery Burns shows up. During Reverend Lovejoy's lecture, he
pulls a string from his coat, revealing a key tied at the end. Abe
nods, and pulls a long string from his own coat; after a while, he
reaches the very end, where a similar key is tied. Burns nods in
agreement.

Asa Phelps spent his entire life in Springfield, except for four years'
service in WWII and one high school day-trip. He worked at the United
Strut and Bracing Works as a molder's boy, until he was replaced by a
Molder-Matic, and died.
-- Eulogy of Asa Phelps as spoken by Reverend Timothy Lovejoy,
      

After Lovejoy drives away, Abe and Burns walk to a monument bearing a
statue of the Hellfish. On the front is a door with nine keyholes, of
which seven already have a key inserted in. Without a word, Abe and
Burns insert their own key and unlock the door, which holds a metal
box. "Would you do the honors?" asks Burns. Abe thus opens the box
and takes out a piece of paper, on which nine names are written.
After he has crossed out Asa Phelps, only his name and Burns' remain.

Burns: There, Simpson: seven gone. As soon as you're in your pressboard
       coffin, I'll be the sole survivor and the treasure will be mine.
  Abe: Over my dead body, it will!
-- Unclear on the concept, 

Burns: Oh, Simpson, can't you go five seconds without humiliating
       yourself?
        [Abe's pants go down with a "boing"]
  Abe: How long was that?
-- About three seconds, 

Burns notes, "Your clownish behavior notwithstanding, we have made a
gentlemen's agreement, and sworn on our lives to honor it."  Then, in
the car, he asks Smithers to have him killed. As Smithers drives away,
Abe's pants go down with a boinging sound again.

[End of Act One.  Time: 4'57"]

At his office, Burns goes through his Rolodex.

Let's see... Mesmerists, Dowsers, Luddites, Alienists, Zoroastrians,
Alphabetizers... A-ha! Assassins...
-- Monty Burns' Rolodex, 

Smithers wonders if assassinating Abe is really necessary due to his
old age, but Burns can't risk to lose the Hellfish bonanza to Abe, so
he needs the world's most devious assassin: Fernando Vidal.

At his mansion, Vidal answers the phone.

Vidal: Hola?
Burns: Fernando, it's M.B.
Vidal: Ah, Marion Barry. Is it time for another shipment already?
-- Old friends die hard, 

"No, it's Montgomery Burns!" Vidal puts up plan A: while Abe is
asleep, he pours some drops of poison in his water glass, which
holds his denture. Then, he simply advances the alarm clock to Abe's
wake-up time. In his slumber, Abe throws away the glass with his
teeth and sticks a clock in his mouth.

        [Abe's poison teeth lie on the floor as he runs with a clock
         in his mouth]
Vidal: Ah, he's more clever than he looks...
-- Or sound, or our best testing indicates,
     

Then it's up to plan B...

   Nurse: Abraham Simpson, your family is here to visit you.
     Abe: Hot diggity, my family's come to visit me!
           [runs down the hall]
          Wait a minute... My family never comes to vi... Whoa!
           [a knife flies at his head]
   Vidal: [disguised as Homer] D'oh! Not again!
   Burns: [disguised as Marge] I can't take much more of your blundering
          numskullery.
Smithers: [disguised as Bart] I'll be in the car, dudes.
-- Just like the real thing, 

Vidal: There is one more way to kill a man, but it is as intricate and
       precise as a well-played game of chess.
        [bursts into Retirement Castle with a machine gun and shoots
         away]
-- Versus Lloyd Christmas, maybe, 

Vidal blows everything to bits but Abe and Jasper.

Was that me or was that you?
-- Jasper after someone shoots a gun,
     

  Abe: Nurse! Someone's trying to kill me!
Nurse: Okay, we'll do something about that right away. Let's start by
       doubling your medication.
-- That will help a bit, 

        [Vidal comes in, shoots everywhere]
Nurse: [loads shotgun]
       [shoots] Our residents
       [shoots] are trying
       [shoots] to nap!
       [shoots]
-- Should've phoned ahead, 

Fearing for his safety, Abe rushes to his son's home.

  Abe: [pounding on the door] Let me in! Someone's trying to kill me!
       Sweet merciful McGillicuddy, you gotta open the door!
Homer: Who is it?
Marge: It's Grampa. And it sounds like he's gotten into the horseradish
       again.
-- Mmm... horseradish, 

Lying on the couch, Abe utters this anecdote of his.

  Abe: And then, a knife flew at my head. And [points to Homer] you
       were there, and [points to Homer] you were there...
Lisa: Uh, Grampa, maybe I should moisten your washcloth.
 Abe: It's plenty moist!
-- Perhaps medication was the answer,
      

Since Abe can't give away the reason for Burns' will to kill him,
nobody believes his story. Nevertheless, they are willing to let him
stay.

Marge: Where are we going to put him?
Homer: Bart's room.
 Lisa: Bart's room.
Marge: Bart's room.
 Bart: Dumpster.
-- I'll go with the family, 

From his room, Bart sighs and looks at the dumpster as his grandfather
unpacks.

 Abe: Sorry to crowd you boy, but I'll let you in on a secret. Burns is
      after me 'cause he wants the Hellfish bonanza.
Bart: Look, if you're gonna stay in my room, could you at least stop
      making up gibberish?
 Abe: Gibberish, eh? Then, what's this?
       [lifts his sleeve, revealing a tattoo]
Bart: Wrinkly gibberish?
-- He's got an answer for everything,
     

I got this in the second World War II...
-- Abe shows off his Hellfish tattoo,
     

Flashback to 1944, at the Ardennes.

Back then, I was known as Sgt. Simpson, and I commanded the Flying
Hellfish, the fightingest squad in the fightingest company in the
third-fightingest battalion in the army.
-- Abe starts his story, 

Abe introduces Bart via flashback to the Flying Hellfish; Iggy Wiggum
who left a grenade without a pin in a knapsack; Sheldon Skinner,
with a "Shoot me" sign on the back; Private Fifth Class Arnie Gumble
who burps in a tank; and Griff, Asa, Ox, and Etch. But every unit has
a troublemaker; in the case of the Hellfish, it was a cocky little
private named Montgomery Burns.

In this flashback, Burns is carried unconscious on a litter, until he
wakes up.

Duh, hey! You said you was dead!
-- Ox carries Burns out on a litter, 

Bart: Mm-hmm. You bossed around the richest, most powerful guy in town.
      How come you were a sergeant and he was only a private?
 Abe: Well... he got busted down for obstructing a probe from J. Edgar
      Hoover. We got stuck with him.
-- That's an onion in the ointment, 

Among Sergeant Simpson's accomplishments is the time he almost shot
the Furher...

Heh heh heh. Now they'll never save your brain, Hitler.
-- Sergeant Simpson about to change history,
      

Of course, something stood in the way: a tennis ball, to be precise,
thrown by nobody else than Monty Burns. "Little help?" he asks,
holding a racket. Soon he has other things to care about, as Germans
start shooting at the squad. One grenade lands right next to Burns,
and Simpson saves the day by sitting on it with his helmet.

Boom! Boom, it went! Boom! Just like that! They took a photo of my
keister for Stars and Stripes. At least they told me it was for Stars
and Stripes.
-- Abraham J. Simpson, 

Back to the closing days of the war, as the Hellfish had just flushed
some Germans out of an abandoned castle, Burns holds a painting, and
carts it away.  Sgt. Simpson threatens to report Burns to Commander
Flanders.

   Sgt.: Just leave [the paintings], Burnsie.
  Burns: Leave them for whom, the Germans, the folks who shoot at us all
         day? Let's just take them. We'll all be rich, rich as Nazis.
-- Wow, Nazis, 
   
   Etch: Think of what a guy could get himself with that kind of
         scratch!
Skinner: Yeah, I could buy chicken dinners three times a day!
 Wiggum: I could buy a brand-new studebaker, one with a fan on the
         dashboard!
 Gumble: I could pay my way into high- [belches] society!
   Sgt.: Well, I don't feel right about it, but I could use a nest egg
         for retirement. I'd hate to wind up in one of them old folks
         homes...
-- WWII paintings are found, 

Burns: Then it's agreed. Of course, we can't sell the paintings now,
       we'd be caught. How many of you are familiar with the concept of
       a "tontine"?
        [all stare at him, until Ox raises his hand]
Burns: All right, Ox. Why don't you take us through it?
   Ox: Duh, essentially, we all enter into a contract whereby the last
       surviving participant becomes the sole possessor of all them
       purty pictures.
Burns: Well put, Oxford.
-- His name comes with a dual meaning,
    

"Now remember, you can't _all_ sign with an X."

 Abe: So, we sealed up the paintings knowing only one of us would ever
      look upon them again. Ox was the first to go; he got a hernia
      carrying the crate out of the castle. Five more men died in the
      Veteran's Day float disaster of '79. Now, with Asa gone, it's down
      to me and Burns.
Bart: Great story Grampa, could've used a vampire though. 'Night.
-- Some captivated audience, 

Abe mourns over the fact that his own grandson doesn't believe him,
until a loud buzzing is heard as someone is sawing the outside wall.
Next thing Bart and Abe know, Burns rides a crane inside the room.

  Abe: [yells] Don't kill me!
Burns: I've tried to meet you halfway on this, Simpson, but you had to
       be little Johnny Live-a-lot. Now, give me your key to the
       Hellfish bonanza.
 Bart: Oh, wow! There really is a treasure! Whatever you do, don't
       give him the key, Grampa.
  Abe: Here's the key.
 Bart: Aw... figures.
-- 

But Bart has something up his sleeve, as he gets on the crane...

 Bart: Hey, Mr. Burns! Can I go with you to get the treasure? I won't
       eat much and I don't know the difference between right and
       wrong.
Burns: Oh, you're a good boy, but the child labor people have been
       watching me like a hawk.
-- Even though they crashed on my property,
     

Burns: Well, I'm off to get paintings; as they say, time is "Monets".
       As you were, Sergeant. [laughs]
        [pushes the wrong button on his crane, and ends up through
         another wall]
Burns: Oh, terribly sorry. Back to sleep, little girl.
 Lisa: Santa?
-- Or was it Maggie now, 

Burns finally manages to get out of the house.

 Abe: Ah, I guess Burns is finally gonna be rich.
Bart: Not without the keys, he isn't! [shows Abe the two keys]
       [long pause]
 Abe: Hey, you got the keys!
-- Delayed reaction, 

Bart: Now we can get the treasure!
 Abe: Oh, what's the use. Burns would still find some way to take it
      from me.
Bart: I can't believe you, Grampa. The sergeant in that story you told
      would never be scared of a dork like Burns. You gotta get that
      treasure, you gotta do it for Ox, and Asa, and Griff, and
      Burnsie... Well, not so much Burnsie.
-- What about the children?, 

 Abe: You really think I can do it?
Bart: [unconvincing] Uh, yes...
-- I'm so glad you believe in me, 

So, they both rush out of Bart's room, and bump into Homer who was up
for a snack.

Homer: Where are you two going at this hour?
 Bart: On a treasure hunt.
Homer: Oh! Can I come?
  Abe: Only if you're ready to stare danger in the face, put your
       manhood to the ultimate test, and take...
Homer: Pass.
-- I'll miss Sherrif Lobo, 

[End of Act Two.  Time: 14'07"]

In order to get the treasure, Bart and Abe head for the Hellfish
monument in Springfield's cemetery.

Bart: Hey, Grampa, do you think that dead bodies get up and walk around
      at night?
 Abe: If they're anything like me, they have to get up twice.
-- 

But before he digs up the treasure, Abe stops before the graves of
the seven living-impaired Hellfish.  "Fellas, it's me, Sarge.  At
ease."

I know I'm bending the rules tonight, but I also know none of you wants
that skunk Burns to take our treasure. And I want you to know that when
I die, you're all welcome to visit me in rich men's heaven.
-- Grampa, 

Abe inserts the two remaining keys, and unlocks each of the nine
locks on the door. The monument rumbles, and out of the Hellfish's
eye comes a beam of light which slowly progresses towards the
treasure's location. When this location is revealed to be at sea,
Bart and Abe can't help shouting out a "D'oh!" in unison.

         Abe: Boy, you borrow us some diving equipment while I borrow
              this boat.
               [starts sawing the anchor]
         Ned: [on the boat] Well, howdy-doodily, stranger! Couldn't
              help but notice you're stealing my boat.
         Abe: I'll bring it back.
         Ned: You ever operated a powerboat?
         Abe: No.
         Ned: Know anything about water safety?
         Abe: No!
         Ned: What do you need it for?
         Abe: It's a secret.
         Ned: Hoo-hoo, sounds spine-tingling-dingling! Just promise
              you'll have a good time.
               [hands him the keys]
         Ned: Maude, boys, come on up! We're gonna have a little camp
              out in the dingy!
Maude &amp; Kids: Yay!
-- Stealing ain't like it used to be anymore,
      

At large, Bart puts on the diving equipment.

 Abe: Now, remember the plan, boy. If you run out of air, tug on the
      rope...
Bart: 64 times, no more, no less. Got it.
 Abe: No no! 63 times if you're out of air; 64 is if you found the
      treasure!
-- It's all by the numbers, 

Bart: Hey, Grampa, do you thing I could've been a Flying Hellfish?
 Abe: You're a gutsy daredevil with a give-em-hell attitude and a
      fourth-grade education. You could've made sergeant.
-- 

Bart jumps off the boat and starts looking for the treasure, which
turns up quickly. He ties the crate to the rope, and starts the
pulling...

Abe: 61... 62... 63... Oh no! 63! He's out of air! I've sent my only
     grandson to a watery gra... 64! He's found the treasure! I'm rich!
-- A wide range of emotions, 

They bring the crate on board, and it is indeed filled with valuable
and well-preserved paintings. As they browse through the lot, the
Hellfish light fades away. Bart lights a flare, revealing the shadow
of Montgomery Burns. Of course, he came to grab the treasure, which
insults Bart.

 Bart: You coward! You're an embarrassment to the name Hellfish.
Burns: Oh, am I? [aims his gun at Bart]
  Abe: No! Look, take the art if you want, just don't hurt the boy.
Burns: Hmm... I'd rather do both.
        [kicks Bart in the crate, which tilts over and falls in the
         sea]
Burns: So long, Sarge. See you at the reunion in November.
-- A one-man party, 

Abe picks up the breathing equipment, throws his denture away, puts
on the mouthpiece, and jumps. As the crate is filling with water, he
manages to open the door and get Bart out of it. They struggle a bit
when Bart refuses to put on the mouthpiece which had just been in
his grandfather's mouth a moment ago, but he finally gives in.

Once they reach the boat, they can rest in safety --and Abe can put
back his denture.

Bart: I'm sorry I cost you your fortune, Grampa.
 Abe: Oh, the fortune doesn't matter, boy; the important thing is
      you're safe. Now let's get that fortune!
-- One-track mind, 

So they engage in pursuit of Burns' boat.

Smithers: They're gaining on us, sir. We'll have to jettison something.
           [Burns stares at him]
          It's been an honor to serve you, sir. [jumps off]
-- 

But Abe won't allow Burns to just get away with it. He takes the
grapple and fires at Burns' boat, then uses the grapple as a rod for
water-skiing. Burns finds his acrobatics quite humorous, but changes
his mind when Abe manages to climb the rope up to his boat and jumps
over him. The two of them are still fighting when the boat hits the
shore, propelling them on the beach.

Burns: Don't kill me...
  Abe: I ain't gonna kill ya, that'd be cowardly; Monty Burns cowardly.
       I just want to watch you squirm.
Burns: Yes sir. [squirms] Is this to your liking?
-- That's a good boy, 

Now, Burnsie, there's one thing we don't stand for in the Hellfish, and
that's trying to kill your commanding officer.
-- The fundamental rule of any squad, 

Therefore, Burns is dismissed from both the Hellfish and the tontine,
leaving Abe as the possessor of the paintings. Having just landed,
Bart is congratulating his grandfather, but is interrupted by the US
State Department, which has been helping the German government search
for this stolen art for 50 years. To avoid an international incident,
they'll be returning it to the descendant of its rightful owner, who
just happens to be driving a brand-new Mercedes.

Agent: Baron von Wortzenberger, on behalf of the American people, I
       apologize for...
Baron: Ja ja ja, mach schnell mit der art things, huh? I must get back
       to Dancecentrum in Struttgart in time to see Kraftwerk.
        [the agent is storing the paintings in the trunk]
Baron: Hey, und dummkopf! Watch out for the CD-changer in my trunk, eh?
       Idiot.
        [hops in the car, turns on the radio and drives away]
  Abe: I guess he deserves it more than I do.
-- 

  Abe: Well, at least I got to show you I wasn't always a pathetic old
       kook...
 Bart: You never were, Grampa.
  Abe: Oh... I'd hug ya, but I know you'd just get embarrassed.
 Bart: I won't get embarrassed; I don't care who knows I love my
       Grampa.
        [both hug]
Baron: Hey, fun boys, get a room!
-- A baron could hold sway, 

[End of Act Three.  Time: 21'30"]

The closing theme is taken from Marge on the Lam [1F03].

"Da da da, da da da, da da da da da da" Homer sings "Summer Samba"
 EPISODE TITLE: Much Apu About Nothing


EPISODE SUMMARY: 

A bear wanders through Evergreen Terrace, and Ned nearly hits him
with his Geo.  Panicked, Ned crashes the car and struggles to enter
the house.  Eventually he crashes through glass near the front door.

A helicopter observes the bear.

This is Kent Brockman with a special report from the Channel 6 News
Copter.  A large, bear-like animal, most likely a bear, has wandered
down from the hill in search of food or perhaps employment.
-- Perhaps on `Gentle Ben', 

This reporter urges families to stay indoors.

Homer laughs and pities the poor `Impson Family' (whose mailbox is
being chewed by the bear) while the rest of the "Impson" family look
out the window worriedly.

Homer: Let's all calm down.  Everyone's going to be just fine, as long
       as I have enough beer.
        [opens the refrigerator only to find boxes of baking soda]
       [screams] All right, that does it.  If I'm going to be trapped
       in the house, I gotta go out and get some beer.
-- Bear problems in Springfield, 

Homer's hare brained scheme ends up in a pantless face to face
confrontation with the bear.  And none too soon, for the police soon
arrive on the scene and tranquilize the bear.  And Barney.

Book 'em Lou.  One count of being a bear.  And one count of being an
accessory to being a bear.
-- Chief Wiggum arrests a bear and Barney, 

While the bear is carried away by the U.S. Forest Service, Barney
is being carried away by Moe.

Maude: Oh, Marge... it was horrible!  We were trapped in the house all
       afternoon... and, well... we had to drink _toilet_ water!
        [sobs]
Marge: Well, things were bad everywhere.
Homer: I'm sick of these constant bear attacks.  It's like a frickin'
       country bear jambaroo around here!
-- Or jamboree even, 

Ned reminds Homer that this is the only bear this town has seen, but
Homer gets the whole town with him with a catchy chant...

Homer: We're here, we're queer, we don't want anymore bears.
Crowd: We're here, we're queer, we don't want anymore bears.
Lenny: Hey, that's a pretty catchy chant.  Where did you hear it?
Homer: Oh, I heard it at the mustache parade they have every year.
-- 

The crowd busts through City Hall and bangs on the mayor's door.

Assistant: Sir, there's an unruly mob here to see you.
   Quimby: Does it have an appointment?
Assistant: [consults clipboard] Yes, it does.
  Skinner: I phoned ahead!
-- Never can be too prepared, 

 Homer: Mr. Mayor, I hate to break it to you, but this town is infested
        by bears.
   Moe: Yeah, and these ones are smarter than the average bear.  They
        swiped my pic-a-nic basket.
 Helen: [frantic] Think of the children!
Quimby: All right, I promise to take swift and decisive action against
        these hibernating hucksters.
         [crowd cheers and leaves]
         [Quimby pulls out a picnic basket]
        Heh heh heh... [eats a sandwich]
-- Diamond Joe Yogi?, 

Later, a full-force Bear Patrol is on watch.  Homer watches proudly.

Homer: Not a bear in sight.  The Bear Patrol must be working like a 
       charm.
 Lisa: That's spacious reasoning, Dad.
Homer: Thank you, dear.
 Lisa: By your logic I could claim that this rock keeps tigers away.
Homer: Oh, how does it work?
 Lisa: It doesn't work.
Homer: Uh-huh.
 Lisa: It's just a stupid rock.
Homer: Uh-huh.
 Lisa: But I don't see any tigers around, do you?
        [Homer thinks of this, then pulls out some money]
Homer: Lisa, I want to buy your rock.
        [Lisa refuses at first, then takes the exchange]
-- Maybe he wants it as a pet, 

The mail arrives.

Homer: Woo-hoo!  A perfect day.  Zero bears and one big fat hairy
       paycheck.
        [opens it up]
       Hey!  How come my pay is so low? ... Bear patrol tax!  This is
       an outrage!  It's the biggest tax increase in history!
 Lisa: Actually, Dad, it's the smallest tax increase in history.
Homer: Let the bears pay the bear tax.  I pay the Homer tax.
 Lisa: That's home-_owner_ tax.
Homer: Well, anyway, I'm still outraged.
-- And with good cause, 

The mob is back, yelling "Down with taxes!  Down with taxes!"

   Quimby: Are those morons getting dumber or just louder?
Assistant: [checks his clipboard] Dumber, sir.
-- Dumb and dumber, 

"They want the bear patrol but they won't pay taxes for it."  Quimby
thinks of a novel solution.  He announces that taxes are high because
of illegal immigrants and that they should be disposed of.

Immigants!  I knew it was them!  Even when it was the bears, I knew it
was them.
-- Moe Szyslak, 

In one week, the town will vote on a special referendum on
Proposition 24, the proposition to get rid of immigrants.  Everyone
cheers, including Quimby.

In class, a mob surrounds Uter as Nelson pulls his suspenders.

 Nelson: Hey, German boy.  Go back to Germania!
          [everyone laughs]
   Uter: I do not deserve this.  I have come here legally as an
         exchange student!
Skinner: Young man, the only thing we exchanged for you is our national
         dignity.
          [everyone laughs]
-- And a trouble student,  

 Willie: [threatens children]  You want to pick on immigrants?  Then
         pick on Willie!
Skinner: Willie, please.  The students want to pick on someone their
         own size.
-- Ach, 

At home, Lisa attempts to talk things out with Homer.

 Lisa: I don't see how you can support Proposition 24, Dad.
Homer: Open your eyes, Lisa!  Our schools are so jam-packed with
       immigrants, people like Bart have lost the will to learn!
 Bart: There's no denying it, Sis.
-- More spacious reasoning, 

Lisa reminds the family that the Simpson family immigrated here,
and Abe gives in.

      Abe: [narrating] The story of the Simpson family began in the Old
           Country.  I forget which one exactly.  My dad would drone
           on and on about America.  He thought it was the greatest
           thing since sliced bread, sliced bread having been invented
           the previous winter.
Abe's dad: [holds up an America pamphlet]  See that, son?  That's where
           we're going to live.  Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow,
           but someday.
      Abe: Later that day, we set sail for America.
Abe's dad: [points at the Statue of Liberty] See that, son?  That's our
           new home.
            [later, the family has moved in... to the Statue]
Young Abe: [playing on Statue's arm] Yay!  I love America!
Abe's mom: Abe!  Supper's on!
            [back to reality]
      Abe: We had to move out once we filled the entire head with
           garbage.
-- The story of the Simpson family, 

At the Kwik-E-Mart, Homer tells Apu that it'll be great once all
the immigrants are shipped out of Springfield.

  Apu: Sir, it may surprise you to know that _I_ am an immigrant.
Homer: You?  Pfft, get out.
-- Well, duh, 

Apu is an illegal immigrant.  He will have to leave if Prop. 24
passes.

I wish I could have stayed one more year or two.  There was so much I
wanted to see and to do and to have done to me.
-- Apu Nahassapeemapetilan, 

Homer almost changes his mind.  Almost.

[End of Act One.  Time: 8'22"]

At Moe's Tavern, Moe and the barflies put up signs.

   Moe: You know what really aggravazes me?  It's them immigants.  They
        wants all the benefits of living in Springfield, but they ain't
        even bother to learn themselves the language.
 Homer: Hey, those are exactly my sentimonies.
Barney: [babbles]
   Moe: Yeah, you said it Barn.
-- Said what?, 

Marge and family (sans Homer) wade through a crowd of picketers to
the Kwik-E-Mart, where Apu offers Ganesha Yoo-Hoo to make the
protestors go away.  Apu tells Marge the story of how he graduated
at the top of his 7,000,000 class at Calcutta Technical Institute to
come study in America.  His family and his child bride bid him fare
well.  At the Springfield Heights Institute of Technology, Apu
learns from Professor John Frink.

        [in the late '70s]
        [Frink stands in front of a huge mainframe]
Frink: Well, sure, the Frinkiac-7 looks impressive [to student] Don't
       touch it! [back to class] But I predict that within 100 years
       computers will be twice as powerful, 10,000 times larger, and
       so expensive that only the five richest kings in Europe will
       own them.
  Apu: Could it be used for dating?
Frink: Well, technically, yes, but the computer matches would be so
       perfect as to eliminate the thrill of romantic conquest.  Ha-ho-
       ha-hey-hoo.
-- Nostradamus he ain't, 

After nine years, Apu completed his thesis, a series of punch cards
comprising the world's first tic-tac-toe program.  To pay off his
loans, he worked in the Kwik-E-Mart and decided to stay once his visa
had expired.

What you're saying is so understandable.  And really, your only crime
was violating U.S. law.
-- Marge to Apu, 

Marge: You know what?  I'm going to vote No on 24.
 Lisa: Mom, you're the greatest! ... Can I have this licorice? [grins]
-- Not the best suckup in town, 

Late at night, Kearney purchases cigars, beer, and other items with
a fake ID.  Instead of prosecuting, Apu lets Kearney go, but first
he has to say where he got the fake ID.

From Fat Tony, he did.  Apu pays lots of money for fake IDs, birth
certificates, etc.  Tony strongly urges Apu to act American.

The Kwik-E-Mart is decked with Yankee attire.  Homer talks to Apu
but notices that he talks American now.

What do you say we take a relaxed attitude towards work and watch the
baseball game?  The nye [New York] Mets are my favorite squadron.
-- Apu acts American, 

But when Homer inquires about Apu's statue of Ganesha, Apu cracks
and breaks down when he realizes he failed his parents.

This passport is a cheap forgery!  A cheap $2,000 forgery!
-- Apu Nahassapeemapetilan, 

You must love this country more than I love a cold beer on a hot
Christmas morning.
-- Homer to Apu, 

Homer: Darn it, Apu, I'm not gonna let them kick you out!
        [pulls a "Yes on 24" button off his shirt]
       I never should have bought this button.  Can I have my three
       dollars back?
  Apu: Store credit only.
-- Business-minded even in grief, 

[End of Act Two.  Time: 14'41"]

Homer brings Apu to the Simpson house.

 Lisa: All right!  Now you have all the Simpsons behind you.
  Apu: That's nice, although three of you are below voting age.
Homer: And I'm not registered.
-- Proposition 24 furor, 

The family try to think of a way that Apu can stay in the country
Bart asks "Why not marry some American broad, then dump her once you
get your citizenship?"

The broad for the job is Selma.

Homer: [on phone] Hello, Selma?  Selma my dear, how are you? ...
       Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.  Listen, shut up for a second.  How
       would you like to marry Apu so he doesn't get deported?
Selma: I'd rather eat poison.  My name's already Selma Bouvier
       Terwilliger Hutz McClure.  God knows it's long enough without
       Nahassapeema-whatever.  From now on, I'm only marrying for
       love. ... Mmm, possibly once more for money.
-- Like the black widow, but not deadly, 

The family ponders on this problem at the dinner table.

  Apu: Oh, it's hopeless.  Oh, poor Apu.
  Abe: Hey!  The government can't control the sky.  What if you lived
       in a balloon?
 Lisa: That's it!
 Bart: Hear that?  Hear that, mom?  She's as dumb as me.
 Lisa: No, not what he said.  What he is.  Grandfather, as in
       grandfather clause.  Apu, how long ago did you visa expire?
  Apu: Seven years, but I don't--
 Lisa: There's an amnesty that was declared for people who've lived here
       as long as you.  You can take the citizenship test!
Marge: But the vote on Proposition 24 is on Tuesday.  You'll have to
       pass the exam before then.
  Apu: Oh, that is not nearly enough time to learn over 200 years of
       American history.
Homer: Oh, it can't be that many.  Come on, Apu.  I'll be your tutor.
        [everyone looks worried]
-- And that means party down, 

Homer teaches Apu facts about American history, like that the 13
stripes on the American flag are for good luck, and the electrical
college, while Chief Wiggum and boys prepare to deport the
immigrants.  The day before the exam, Homer asks Apu to study his
9th-grade history notes.  Apu tries to study, but falls asleep after
reading two words.

In the morning, Apu wakes up.

 Apu: Ohh, I fell asleep!  I have forgotten everything that Mr. Homer
      taught me!
Lisa: Perfect.  Let's roll.
-- Apu takes the citizenship test, 

Through another sea of protestors, Apu takes the written exam, then
the oral exam.

Proctor: All right, here's your last question.  What was the cause of
         the Civil War?  
    Apu: Actually, there were numerous causes.  Aside from the obvious
         schism between the abolitionists and the anti-abolitionists,
         there were economic factors, both domestic and inter--
Proctor: Wait, wait... just say slavery.
    Apu: Slavery it is, sir.
-- 

Apu is now a citizen, and Homer throws a "Welcome to America" party.

  Apu: Today, I am no longer an Indian living in America.  I am an
       Indian-American.
 Lisa: You know, in a way, all Americans are immigrants.  Except, of
       course Native Americans.
Homer: Yeah, Native Americans like us.
 Lisa: No, I mean American Indians.
  Apu: Like me.
-- Blame Columbus, 

If I could just say a few words... I'd be a better public speaker.
-- Homer J. Simpson, 

Homer makes a rousing speech against Proposition 24, and makes
another chant.  Unfortunately, this just isn't enough, as the
proposition passes with a record 95% vote in favor.

When are people going to learn? ... Democracy doesn't work!
-- Homer J. Simpson, free-thinking anarchist, 

At the Kwik-E-Mart, Apu opens a letter containing a jury duty summons
He sobs as he celebrates his first day as a true American citizen...
by throwing the paper away.

Marge is happy that things worked out for everyone.  Well, almost
everyone...

Ach... ingrates.
-- Groundskeeper Willie is deported,

 EPISODE TITLE: Homerpalooza


EPISODE SUMMARY:  {fb}

It's the School District Safety Awards night, and the winner is...
no, that can't be! Not Otto?!

Wow. You know, most of my life I've... I've had to live with the shame
of being a screw-up. But now, as I stand here with the award for the
district's safest bus driver... well, it... it's like a dream come
true.
-- The fantasies of a bus driver, 

Of course it is a dream, as the district's safest bus driver would
never be sleeping on the road, which is what Otto is doing right now.
Milhouse wakes him up just in time to dodge Jasper who is crossing
the street, but abrupt maneuvers send the bus spinning off control
into the auto wrecking yard. With all the professionalism he has,
Otto manages to park the bus right into the car crusher. The kids run
out screaming as the bus is quickly reduced to one tenth of its size.

So, um... who's good at keeping secrets?
-- Otto, about to design a cover-up, 

Dear parents. Due to yesterday's unscheduled field trip to the auto
wrecking yard, the school bus will be out of commission for two weeks.
By reading this letter out loud, you have waived any legal
responsability on our part in perpetuity throughout the universe.
-- Marge reads the school's letter, 

Homer: Well, we'll have to organize a car pool. Hey! Every day will be
       like a road trip... with your dad... to school!
 Kids: [groans]
-- This almost sounds exciting, 

The next morning, Homer takes the responsability of car pooling Bart,
Lisa, Milhouse, Nelson and Janey. He tries to make the trip fun, but
fails miserably.

Homer: So... how about those rainbow suspenders, huh?
 Bart: Dad...?
Homer: Pretty cool way to keep your pants up, eh?
 Bart: Dad!
Homer: I see these kids now with "Jive" printed on their shirts.
       Pftt... Now, I can teach you how you're supposed to say "jive".
 Lisa: Dad... Please just drive the car, dad.
Homer: I'm watching the road, sweetie.
       You jive turkey. See? You got to sass it. Quit jivin' me,
       turkey. You got to sass it. A "turkey" is a bad person.
-- On the verge of beating Grampa, 

In order to sink even lower, Homer turns on the radio to his favorite
station, which he's the only one in the car to enjoy.

KFSL -- Fossil 103. Classic hits from Abba to Zeppelin, comma, Led.
-- Never thought I'd miss KBBL, 

Milhouse asks Homer to change the radio station, but Homer retorts
that it's Grand Funk Railroad.  No one knows what he's talking about,
and Homer is surprised.

Homer drops the kids to school, and they rush out of the car.

For more information on Grand Funk, consult your school library!
-- Homer's word of wisdom, 

That afternoon, on the way back, Homer explains to the kids how he
nods his head to the music.

 Bart: Dad, please, you're embarrassing us.
Homer: No, I'm not.
-- What an argument, 

And thus Homer keeps going on and on...

Grand Funk Railroad paved the way for Jefferson airplane, which cleared
the way for Jefferson starship. The stage was now set for the Alan
Parsons project, which I believe was some sort of hovercraft.
-- Homer, who else, 

 Bart: Dad! No one cares about any of your stupid dinosaur bands! You
       have the worst, lamest taste in music ever.
	[turns off the radio]
Homer: I'm just trying to party with you guys.
 Bart: Homer, first of all, it's "par-tay", and second, we wouldn't
       "par-tay" with you if you were the last dad on Earth.
-- 

This slap in the face troubles Homer, so he decides to take a walk at
his favorite music store, "Good Vibrations" --later renamed "Suicide
Notes".  He searches for the latest Bread releases and is surprised
when directed to oldies.

Homer: Now, here are some of your no-name bands. Sonic Youth? Nine Inch
       Nails? Hullabalooza?
Clerk: Hullabalooza is a music festival; the greatest music festival of
       all time.
Homer: There can only be one truly great festival a lifetime and it's
       the "Us Festival".
Clerk: The what festival?
Homer: The "Us Festival"! Geez! It was sponsored by the guy from Apple
       Computers.
Clerk: What computers?
-- You know, the guy with the suit, 

Homer walks in the street, dejected.

Why do you need new bands? Everyone knows rock attained perfection in
1974. It's a scientific fact.
-- Homer, 

Flashback to the aforementioned year, where a group of people are
installing a strobe light in a custom van of theirs: "Quadraphonic
sound, a waterbed, and now a strobe light. Gentlemen, say hello to
the second-base mobile." When they resume dancing on "Frankenstein"
with the strobe light on, Homer tries to join in, but fails
miserably.

"Back then, we didn't care what anyone thought and the chicks found
that irresistible." narrates Homer, as he remembers drinking from the
school fountain as two teen girls walk by. "I think you're cool,
Homer Simpson." affirms one of them, and even if the other one
declares that this remark was mean, Homer takes it as a compliment.

"But most of all, I remember the music..."  Homer and Barney, in
Homer's room, butcher "You Make Me Feel Like Dancing", when Abe
interrupts them.  "What the hell are you two doing?"  "It's called
rockin' out," replies Barney, and Homer tells Abe he wouldn't
understand 'cause he's not "with it".

I used to be with it, but then they changed what "it" was. Now, what
I'm with isn't it, and what's "it" seems weird and scary to me.
-- 

He warns them, "It'll happen to you."  But teen Homer denies the
undeniable, and looks at the mirror: "We're gonna keep on rockin'
forever... forever... forever..." Fade-in to adult Homer, looking at
his reflection, and realizing those words have lost their meaning.

Marge: What's wrong, Homie?
Homer: [sighs] I went to the record store today and they were playing
       all that music I've never heard of. It was like the store had
       gone crazy.
Marge: Hmm. Record stores have always seemed crazy to me, but it
       doesn't upset me. Music is none of my business.
-- 

"That's fine for you, Marge", Homer says, "but I used to Rock 'N'
Roll all night and party everyday."  Now he finds he has little time
left to get funky.

I've gotta get out of this rut, and back into the groove.
-- Homer, 

Marge asks him to include Bart and Lisa.

The next morning, Bart and Lisa apprehend another humiliation.

Bart: Dear Lord, if you keep Homer from embarrassing us today, we
      promise to build several churches in your honor.
Lisa: Bart, no!
-- The price to pay, 

Homer passes in front of Milhouse without stopping.

Hey, wait! I'm okay today! My mom bought me deodorant!
-- Milhouse, 

 Lisa: Dad, you forgot to pick up Milhouse.
Homer: [exagerated] I did? I must be getting forgetful in my old age.
       Open the glove compartment and fetch me my brain medicine.
-- This stuff doesn't seem to be working at all, 

Lisa doesn't understand the point of all this, but Homer keeps
pointing at the glove compartent. Curious, she opens it, to find...

Homer: Well? What have we here? Looks like your uncool dad scored
       tickets to Hullabalooza!
 Lisa: [gasps] Bart... these look real...
 Bart: Check the authenticator spot
	[Lisa removes a sticker, which reveals a microchip]
 Chip: This is an authentic Hullabalooza ticket. For authentic
       refreshment, eat Clark bars. And for totally outrageous class
       rings, it's Josten's. Go, Josten's!
-- 

You're not going to school today. Today your classroom will be the
Capitol City amphitheater; your teacher, four dozen rock bands. So, get
ready for some well-supervised craziness while you rock out with your
father!
-- Homer, 

[End of Act One.  Time: 7'28"]

Once they reach Hullabalooza ("Free nose piercing with every
admission"), the kids feel right at home.

Wow! It's like Woodstock, only with advertisements everywhere and tons
of security guards.
-- Lisa reflects on Hullabalooza, 

They get let in, but Homer has to surrender his homemade kahlua.

 Lisa: Generation X may be shallow but at least they have tolerance and
       respect for all people.
Homer: Hey: a freak show!
-- To a certain extent, 

Performers include a bearded woman, a man smoking dozens of
cigarettes at one time, two poodles, and a man able to stick nails in
his nose.  After hitting his finger with the hammer, he presents the
next attraction: Cypress Hill.

Before we start, we have a lost child here. If she's not claimed within
the next hour, she will become property of Blockbuster Entertainment.
-- A warning from Cypress Hill, 

Bart: [sniffing] What is that smell?
Lisa: It smells like Otto's jacket...
-- Which can only mean one thing... 

Homer, on his side, is buying some kind of Jamaican hat.

Clerk: Dude, karma.
Homer: What?
Clerk: [pointing at the hat] Karma, karma.
	[pause]
Homer: [neuter] Oh, I get it. [walks away]
-- But I don't, 

Just as Bart and Lisa are starting to appreciate the show, Homer
shows up, wearing this hat of his.

 Bart: Dad, you cannot wear that! That's a rastafarian hat.
Homer: Pft. Hey, I've been safariing since before you were born.
 Lisa: Wearing a Jamaican hat makes a bold statement about your
       connection to reggae music.
Homer: Well, excuse me.
       [sticks a "Too cool for this planet" sticker to his hat]
 Bart: You know what, dad? Maybe we'll go exploring on our own for a
       while.
	[the kids run away]
-- Run boy, run for your life!, 

Left alone, it's time for Homer to get in touch with the young
people.  He tries to blend in the crowd, but his Jamaican-rastafarian
hat gets in the way.

Homer: Good concert, am I right?
Teen1: Yeah, nice try, narc.
Teen2: Where's a narc?
Teen3: Who?
Teen1: That fat Jamaican guy.
Homer: What did I say? What's going on?
Teen4: Hey, we're just trying to have a good time, narc. Why do you
       want to destroy us?
Teen5: Don't commit your hate crimes here. [yelling] HATE CRIME!
-- All I did was say "Gimme four more justices", 

Thus Homer finds himself on the top of the crowd, being led outside.

Meanwhile, Bart and Lisa are at the concert listening to Smashing
Pumpkins, where the crowd is  dancing in sort sort of nostalgic
trance.

Lisa: It may be bleak, but this music is really getting to the crowd.
Bart: Eh, making teenagers depressed is like shooting fish in a barrel.
-- 

Homer walks away, disillusioned as always.

Oh... Makes no sense. I haven't changed since high school and suddenly
I'm uncool.
-- Hand Homer a mirror, 

In his rage, Homer kicks a cannon, which goes haywire. After several
bursts, it shoots its bullet right into Homer's stomach. After
bouncing off and falling on the ground, the bullet breaks open,
revealing an inflatable pig, which soars in the sky.

    Tech: Aw, man. There goes Peter Frampton's big finale. He's gonna
	  be pissed off.
Frampton: You're damn right I'm going to be pissed off; I bought that
	  pig at Pink Floyd's yard sale!
-- Oink oink, 

But the crowd is more impressed with Homer's ability to withstand
such a blow without any side effects. Even a manager is impressed:

Sir, I run Hullabalooza's pageant of the transmundane --the freak show,
and I've been looking for a big fatso to shoot with a cannon. I'd like
very much for you to be that fatso.
-- Hullabalooza's manager wants to hire Homer, 

Homer is flattered, but Marge doesn't take it the same way.

Marge: So... you want to go on tour with a traveling freak show.
Homer: I don't think I have a choice, Marge.
Marge: Of course you have a choice.
Homer: How do you figure?
Marge: You don't have to join a freak show just because the opportunity
       came along.
Homer: You know, Marge, in some ways, you and I are very different
       people.
-- After all these years, he finds out, 

As you could've guessed, Homer stuck with his idea, and is about to
be shot on stage for the first time ever.

[in a shy, nervous tone] Hi everybody. Is everybody... good?
-- Homer is about to begin his number, 

Homer puts on his safety glasses, takes place in front of the cannon,
and receives the bullet right in the stomach. He quickly gets up,
though, and is acclaimed by the crowd.

In backstage, Homer autographs a cannon ball: "Stay in school, your
hero, Homer". The kid takes the ball, but is instantly crushed by it.

Corgan: Hey cannonball, I like your statement: when life takes a cheap
	shot at you, you stand your ground. Billy Corgan, Smashing
	Pumpkins.
 Homer: Homer Simpson, smiling politely.
-- That's not a band!, 

 Homer: You know, my kids think you're the greatest. And thanks to your
	gloomy music, they've finally stopped dreaming of a future I
	can't possibly provide.
Corgan: Well, we try to make a difference.
-- Positive differences, check with Barry Manilow, 

At school, Bart reads a letter from his father.  "Dear Bart and Lisa.
All is well on tour with America's most popular alternative music
festival."  Cut to a shot of the Hullabalooza bus on a 3-way
crossing.  They turn left for Cleveland, then back and right for
Cincinnati, then they change their minds and turn back home.

"Our first job is to entertain."  Homer gets shot with a cannon, with
cheering from the crowd.  "And I like to think sometimes we get a
message across as well."  Same thing, but this time Homer has "No
Litter" written on his stomach before he gets shot.

"But the main thing is: I've finally tapped into that spirit of self-
destruction that makes Rock 'N' Roll the king of music."  Everyone on
the bus is cheering Homer, who's "water-skiing" with the bus, only
with frying pans instead of skis.  Cypress Hill throws cans at him.
Homer yells "Woo-hoo!"

And the tour keeps going on, with a huge success.

Teen1: Oh, here comes that cannonball guy. He's cool.
Teen2: Are you being sarcastic, dude?
Teen1: I don't even know anymore.
-- Well, duh, 

Thank you! And remember, don't trust anyone over 30! And now, Peter
Frampton!
-- Homer, after his number, 

Corgan: Hey, Homer, looks like our next stop is your hometown,
	Springfield.
D'Arcy: Is it true that we have to bring our own water?
 Homer: We got a little rule back home: if it's brown, drink it down;
	if it's black, send it back.
-- Springfield, still a national proudness, 

Chamberlin: The hometown show's the big one, Homer.
       Iha: Yeah, people who called you a weirdo in high school get to
	    see what a successful freak you've become.
	    [points to D'Arcy]
    D'Arcy: Hey, I wasn't a weirdo. I was in the audio-visual club.
     Homer: Really? Me too! But I got kicked out 'cause of my views of
	    Vietnam. Also, I was stealing projectors.
-- Also because I didn't know what I was doing, 

When Homer drinks beer to celebrate, though, his stomach echoes when
he burps.  The manager, worried, slaps his stomach and the same
echoic sound occurs.

Homer, nothing's more important to me than the health and well-being of
my freaks. I'm sending you to a vet.
-- Hullabalooza manager, 

The veterinarian diagnoses that the cannonballs have demolished
Homer's stomach.  Among other things, he strongly encourages Homer
not to get hit by another cannonball.

Homer: Pftt... Rules. I'm a rocker, I don't care for rules.
  Vet: Mr. Simpson, this is serious. If you take one more cannonball to
       the gut, you will die.
Homer: Die? Well, you don't scare me, doc, 'cause dying would be a
       stone groove. Got any messages for Jimi Hendrix?
  Vet: Yes: "Pick up your puppy."
	[pan to Rover Hendrix]
-- And play better shuffleboard, 

[End of Act Two.  Time: 15'24"]

Back at home, Homer is the subject of Bart's attention.

 Bart: So, what's it like being famous, dad?
Homer: People know your name, but you don't know theirs. It's great.
-- Basic mantra of the prestigious,  

 Bart: Do you wear boxers or briefs?
Homer: [checking] Nope.
 Bart: What religion are you?
Homer: You know, the one with all the well-meaning rules that don't
       work out in real life. Uh... Christianity.
-- 

Homer wonders why all those questions, but Bart avoids the subject by
saying it's "just some report [he's] gotta do for school", and offers
him a piece of pie. While he's away, Homer takes a look at Bart's
paper, which is about the person he admires most: his father. When
Bart comes back, they eat their pie silently, sharing this moment,
but the rumbling from Homer's stomach reminds him of the price he
could pay.

At Springfield Fairgrounds, the family is allowed access to the
backstage of Hullabalooza.

Guard: Clear the way, clear the way! Performer coming through.
Marge: This is so exciting. Last time I got to go backstage was when
       Bart ripped his pants at the Christmas play.
 Bart: Mom...
   DJ: [pointing to Bart] Ha-ha!
-- Cypress Hill takes a cue from Muntz, 

Once backstage, it's time for the last-minute preparations...

Who is playing with the London Symphony Orchestra? Come on people,
somebody ordered the London Symphony Orchestra... posssibly while high.
-- Backstage at Hullabalooza, 

Most signs point at Cypress Hill, so they take the orchestra:

       DJ: Uh, do you know "Insane in the Brain"?
Violinist: [British accent] We mostly know classical... but we could
	   give it a shot.
	    [hip-hop music, gradually accompanied by the orchestra]
	   "Put the water on the flame, boiling temper"
	   "Just toss that ham in the frying pan like spam..."
-- Mmm... spam, 

On stage, Peter Frampton uses a synthesized voice to create the
illusion that his guitar "talks" while playing.

     Jimbo: Man, that guy's guitar is talking.
      Otto: Hey, my shoes are talking too!
 Left Shoe: Don't worry. We won't hurt you.
Right Shoe: We only want to have some fun.
-- 

There are even some spectators you wouldn't expect...

   Burns: [chuckles] And to think, Smithers: you laughed when I bought
	  TicketMaster. "Nobody's going to pay a 100% service charge."
Smithers: Well, it's a policy that ensures a healthy mix of the rich
	  and the ignorant, sir.
-- Burns attends Hullabalooza, 

Back on stage, Frampton's having some problems with his show, as his
"pig" pedal doesn't do anything.

Frampton: God. Homer Simpson wrecks my pig, Cypress Hill steals my
	  orchestra, and Sonic Youth's in my cooler! Get out of there,
	  you kids!
   Moore: Aw, come on, Mr. Frampton. You're not gonna eat all that
	  watermelon.
Frampton: Please, I'm trying to perform!
 Shelley: Go ahead. We'll stay here and guard your cooler.
	   [they all dig in]
-- 

Discouraged, Frampton leaves the stage to Homer.

And now, Springfield, this is the moment that you've been waiting for,
the man who embodies everything about Rock 'N' Roll, except the music.
-- Introduction, 

The crowd cheers their homegrown hero like no one else; even Milhouse
is proud to state: "I used to carpool with that guy".

Oh, this is heavy. Okay Homer, don't fear the reaper.
-- 

Marge: Cannons are designed to hurt. They're designed to hurt.
 Lisa: Shh! Mom, dad needs our support.
Marge: [smiles to Homer]
 Bart: You're the coolest dad alive!
-- He won't stay both for very long, 

As the cannon fuse burns, everybody is paralyzed in anticipation of
Homer's stunt, even Sonic Youth who have stopped eating their
watermelon. Ultimately, Homer dodges the cannon, to the disappoint-
ment of the crowd.

I thought I had an appetite for destruction, but all I wanted was a
club sandwich.
-- Homer, after "wussing out", 
   
   Homer: Oh, Marge. I thought I had an appetite for destruction, but
	  all I wanted was a club sandwitch.
   Marge: There might be one in this cooler.
	  [digs in Frampton's cooler] Oh, here you go.
Frampton: Ohh!
-- 

Oh, man. Homer wussed out. I'm so disillusioned.
-- Lee Ranaldo, 
 
Hullabalooza isn't about freaks; it's about music, and advertisement,
and youth-oriented product positioning.
-- Kim Gordon, 

 Gordon: Hey, Hullabalooza isn't about freaks; it's about music, and
	 advertisement, and youth-oriented product positioning.
Sen-Dog: That, and getting toasted. Nicely toasted.
-- 

Manager: Homer, I'm sorry. There's nothing worse than a yellow-bellied
	 freak... unless that's his act. I expect your letter of
	 resignation on my desk.
  Homer: You have a desk?
Manager: I mean, the hood of my car.
-- 

     Homer: I'll miss you, Pumpkins, but I just can't share your bleak
	    world view. I've got too much to live for.
    Corgan: We envy you, Homer. All we have is our music, our legions
	    of fans, our million of dollars and our youth.
	     [pause]
	    Woo-Hoo!
       Iha: Let's all go out and buy fur coats!
Chamberlin: I want a walk-in humidor.
-- So much for _that_ plan, 

In the car, on the trip to go home, Homer concludes his adventure:

    Homer: So, I realized that being with my family is more important
	   than being cool.
     Bart: Dad, what you just said was powerfully uncool.
    Homer: You know what the song says: "It's hip to be square".
     Lisa: That song is so lame.
    Homer: So lame that it's... cool?
Bart+Lisa: No.
    Marge: Am I cool, kids?
Bart+Lisa: No.
    Marge: Good. I'm glad. And that's what makes me cool, not caring,
	   right?
Bart+Lisa: No.
    Marge: Well, how the hell do you be cool? I feel like we've tried
	   everything here.
    Homer: Wait, Marge. Maybe if you're truly cool, you don't need to
	   be told you're cool.
     Bart: Well, sure you do.
     Lisa: How else would you know?
-- 

[End of Act Three.  Time: 21'30"]

Over the credits, a crowd of teenagers dances mindlessly to "The
Simpsons" theme as played by Sonic Youth.

 EPISODE TITLE: Summer of 4 Ft. 2


EPISODE SUMMARY:  {jl}

It's the last day of school, and Milhouse asks Bart which is his
favorite kind of sprinkler.  What follows is indescribable.  Milhouse
stares at the clock in desperation while Bart looks outside and
watches ice cream men prepare for the summer.  Finally, the bell
rings.

	    [bell rings]
 Milhouse: School's out!  Up yours, Krabappel!
	    [runs out, while other students sit]
Krabappel: Well, I'm glad the rest of you remembered that summer
	   vacation starts at the end of the day, not the beginning.
-- Milhouse suffers heat stroke, 

      Lou: Here you go, ma'am.
	    [escorts Milhouse back into the classroom]
Krabappel: Mmm.  Quick work.  How'd you know he was gonna run?
      Lou: We got someone on the inside.
	    [everyone glares at Martin who laughs sheepishly]
-- Tell them what we do with squealers, 

At the Yearbook Office ("Immortalizing your awkward phase"), Lisa,
the yearbook editor, opens the first box of yearbooks, accidentally
cutting one.  Beezee remarks that Lisa should be the most popular
girl in school because she was the yearbook editor. (Yeah, right)

At the closing moments of the school, Ms. Hoover tells the story
of Abe Lincoln.

Hoover: And so, as Abraham Lincoln sat in Ford's theatre that night,
	John Wilkes Booth entered, drew his gun, and...
	 [the bell rings]
	Well, that's it.  Have a nice summer, everyone.
	 [everyone leaves except for Chuck and Ralph]
 Chuck: But what happened in Ford's theatre?
 Ralph: Was President Lincoln okay?
Hoover: He was fine.
	 [Chuck leaves]
	Go home, Ralph.
-- Revisionist history, 

It's reality check time after school as Lisa hands out the yearbooks,
or at least tries to.

  Lisa: In the beginning of the school year, each of you received a
	colored ticket.  I hope everyone still has theirs.
 Crowd: Not me.  Uh uh.  I don't have it...
Nelson: Who died and made you boss?
  Lisa: Mr. Estes, the publications advisor.  I edited the whole thing.
Nelson: If you hadn't done it, some other loser would have.  So quit
	milking it!
-- Nelson puts things into the proper perspective, 

Nelson passes out the yearbooks freely.  Lisa can't get anyone to
sign her yearbook.  Upset, she sees a booth where Bart is signing
everyone's yearbook.  There is a large crowd.

Milhouse: This is Becky.  She's in the second grade.
    Bart: Hi, Becky, thanks for coming out. [signs her yearbook]
   Becky: [reading] "See 'ya."  He writes the way people talk!
-- Incoherently, 

   Bart: Your daughter is named Seymour?
Skinner: Well, I... uh... ye... uh... I lied.  It's for me.
-- A memento of gray hair and short tempers, 

I don't get it.  Straight A's, perfect attendance, bathroom timer.  I
should be the most popular girl in school.
-- Lisa, unclear on the concept, 

At home, Ned tells Homer that since he got called into jury duty,
he can't use his beach house, and asks Homer to use it for the summer
free of charge.  When Homer refuses at first, Ned offers to check
Homer's septic tank, and it's a deal.  "You give a little, you get
a little," Homer says.

At dinner...

Marge: And you're sure the Flanderses won't be there?  Well, it sounds
       great.
-- The Simpsons borrow the Flanders' beach house, 

Marge: Bart, you can invite Milhouse.  Lisa, you can bring a friend
       too.
 Lisa: [chuckling nervously] Hey.  Great... a friend... heh, heh...
       or companion... or... I'unno, stuffed animal?
-- Don't knock teddy bears, 

Lisa packs for the trip, and Marge pokes her head in.

Marge: So, did you call any of your friends?0
 Lisa: Friend?  [scoffs] These are my only friends.
	[holds up a book]
       Grownup nerds like Gore Vidal, and even he's kissed more boys
       than I ever will.
Marge: Girls, Lisa.  Boys kiss girls.
-- Marge's homophobia shows through, 

Lisa laments that she can't make any friends.  Marge tries to console
her by telling her that she's dreamed her daughter would be her
best friends, but Lisa needs kid friends.

Marge: I'm sure you'll make plenty of friends.  All you have to do is
       be yourself.
	[walks away]
 Lisa: Be myself?  I've been myself for eight years and it hasn't
       worked.
-- All those brains and you just figured it out, 

Lisa dumps the contents of her suitcase on the bed, clothes and
all, and heads out.  

Homer: [holds Lisa's suitcase] Somebody's travelling light.
 Lisa: Meh.  Maybe you're just getting stronger.
Homer: Well, I have been eating more.
-- And how, 

The Simpsons, plus a van Houten, head out.

[End of Act I.  Time: 5'48"]

 Bart: When the hell are we getting to... where the hell are we going?
Marge: Mmm.  It's called Little Pwagmattasquarmesettport.  It's known
       as America's scrod basket.
 Bart: I thought Springfield was America's scrod basket.
Marge: No, Springfield is America's crud bucket.  At least according
       to Newsweek.
-- You can see our house in that photo!, 

They arrive at the Flanders' beach home, and Homer reads a welcome
letter Ned left at the door.

"Wel-diddly-elcome, Simpsons."  Oh, jeez, he actually wrote "diddly".
-- Homer reads a letter from Ned, 

"I have left a few helpful notes around the house."  When Homer
opens the door the house is full of them.

Marge walks to the kitchen.

Marge: [reads note on freezer] "Put food in me."
Homer: I'll take that. [sticks it on his belly]
-- It sure does, 

Marge: [removing an ice cube tray filled with notes reading "Fill Me"]
       Well, duh.  With what, Ned?
       [removes note, revealing another note reading "With Water"]
       Mmm...
-- No detail has been overlooked, 

Bart enters his room, and sees a piggy bank with a note reading
"Please don't steal from me."  Which Bart disobeys.

Marge makes the beds while Lisa watches.

Marge: Isn't this fun, honey?
 Lisa: [sarcastic] It must be exciting to make a different set of beds.
Marge: I know you're joking, but it is!  Say, why don't you put on
       your swimsuit and head for the beach?
 Lisa: You know, it's kinda funny.  With all the craziness and
       confusion and mishegoss of packing, I forgot to pack!
Marge: Lisa, that's not at all like you.
 Lisa: Exactly.
Marge: Mmm...
Homer: [wearing "Welcome" mat across his groin] I forgot my swimsuit
       too, but I improvised.
	[goes outside]
       Hello!
	[police sirens blare]
-- Now the doorknob falls of..., 

Marge and Lisa go shopping for new clothes, and Lisa turns away all
of Marge's choices for a hippie ensemble.  (Kinda...)  Lisa goes
out to find some friends, leaving Marge with none... except for
Maggie.

Bart and Milhouse dive in the lake... during low tide.  Ouch.

Lisa searches for new friends, but encounters an old one... the
library.

   Lisa: A library! ... No, I can't... that's the old, nerdy Lisa.
	  [Pippi Longstockings appears]
  Pippi: Lisa, read about my adventures in the South Seas, and make
	 me live again!
	  [New Yorker's "Eustace B. Tilley" appears]
Eustace: We've got periodicals on microfiche...
	  [Alice (of Wonderland) and the Mad Hatter appear]
  Alice: [nervously] Won't you join our tea party?  It would be ever
	 so...
	  [Mad Hatter pulls a gun and grabs Alice]
	 Don't do it, Lisa.  It's a trap!  Run!  Run!
	  [Lisa does so]
-- Lisa encounters old friends, 

Lisa fails to find any kids, but soon hears some talking under the
boardwalk...

 Boy: So he's all, like, pffhhhtt...
Girl: Pft, I can totally hear him going that.
Lisa: [listening in] Only kids are that incoherent!
-- 

Lisa runs under the boardwalk and sees a girl and three boys
chatting it up.  Her first attempt to talk to them is blocked by a
loud seagulls.

It's not your fault... you don't control the birds.  Someday you will,
but not now.
-- Lisa consoles herself, 

Lisa strolls by saying "Hi", and one boy says "What's up?"  The
girl calls... "Hey, I like your hat."

Erin: Hey, I like your hat.
Lisa: A compliment!
       [thinking] Scanning for sarcasm... it's clean!  Go!
-- Lisa's brain, 

Lisa goes and says "Thanks."  After a pause, she asks "You guys
skate?" indicating Rick's skateboard.  But they can't, since cops
keep on confiscating the boards.  So Lisa directs them to a
virtually deserted place... the library.

Erin and Lisa talk.  Lisa says that her "goony brother" reads
books, and she usually hangs out in front...

Lisa: I usually hang out in front.
Erin: You like to hang out too?
Lisa: Well, it beats doing stuff.
Erin: Yeah.  Stuff sucks.
-- But stuff is cool too, right?, 

Dean offers Lisa his skateboard, and Lisa tries, feebly.  Her
efforts are cut short by a jealous Bart, who performs a number of
skateboard stunts before trying to steal their friendship away.

The whole thing smacks of effort, man.
-- Ben, 

Bart walks off in ahuff.

While Lisa plays with her newfound friends, the remaining Simpsons
play "Mystery Date", the only game available in the Flanders'
Casa de Verano.

Marge: Come on, Homer.  Open the door for your mystery date.
Homer: [does so] Ooh, the captain of the football team.  He's a
       dreamboat.  Don't wait up, Marge.
-- The family play "Mystery Date", 

Bart gets the Dud, who looks remarkably like Milhouse.

Meanwhile, Lisa tells her friends about the hermit crab.  She
keeps the crab's old shell:

Lisa: A gift from my favorite crustacean.
Rick: Hey... did you learn that word from a teacher for something?
Lisa: Nooo... I heard it on Baywatch.
       [murmurs of consent]
-- So much educational value, 

Homer goes shopping for fireworks at the Li'l Valu-Mart, with a
clerk that looks almost like Apu.

Hi... ummm... let me have some of those porno magazines... large box
of condoms... a couple of those panty shields [quickly] and some
illegal fireworks [back to normal] and one of those disposable enemas.
Ehhh... make it two.
-- Homer shops for illegal fireworks, 

My apologies, sir, but the sale of fireworks is prohibited in this
state and is punishable by a f...
 [the last customer leaves]
Follow me.
-- Moral values up high, 

The clerk shows Homer into his stockpile of fireworks.

Any red-blooded, flag-fearing American would love the M-320.
Celebrate the independence of your nation by blowing up a small
part of it.
-- 

Homer buys a stick of M-320.

Lisa and her friends hang out in the beach house.  Lisa suggests a
4th of July party on the beach, due to lack of better plans.

Marge goes through Homer's purchase.  "I don't know what you have
planned tonight, but count me out."

Marge: Didn't you buy any meat?
Homer: [stroking a firecracker] This baby's sure to kill something.
-- 

Homer asks Bart for a lighter, but he doesn't have any.  No matches,
either.  So Homer lights it over the kitchen stove.  And burns off
a large portion of the fuse.  In an excitement, Homer plays hot
potato with the firecracker until he tosses it in the dishwasher
where it blows up.  Soon, the sink is upchucking oil.

At night, Bart grows bitterly jealous of Lisa and her new friends.
He wants to go down to the beach with them, but Marge says no.

Marge: Let Lisa be alone with her new friends.
 Bart: They're _my_ friends rightfully.  She only got them by copying
       me.
 Lisa: [calling out] Don't have a cow, man!
 Bart: See?  That's my expression.
Marge: Oh, you haven't said that in four years.  Let Lisa have it.
 Bart: It's the principle.  She's got to learn!
Marge: NO!  Now, park your keister, meister.
	[Bart sulks while Marge walks away]
 Lisa: [in distance] Aye Carumba!
-- A little meta-humor for your enjoyment, 

Erin gives Lisa a friendship bracelet, and Lisa reciprocates by
handing Erin a necklace she made from the hermit crab's shell and
cinnamon dental floss.  Meanwhile, Bart spies on them, using
Milhouse's glasses.  He plots to end this, walks off, and forgets
to give Milhouse back his glasses.  Milhouse pets something nasty.

[End of Act Two.  Time: 16'57"] (Pretty long 2nd act...)

Lisa is bounced up and down on a sheet supported by her new
friends.

I'm dizzy... I'm nauseous... but I'm popular!
-- Lisa Simpson, 

But Bart has other plans.  He comes forward to Lisa's new friends
and reveals the truth: Lisa is a Teacher's Pet.  Lisa runs off
sobbing.

At breakfast, Lisa gets mad at Bart while Marge isn't around.
Marge announces a fair in town.

Bart and Lisa attend the fair and get into various fights.  Bart
and Lisa attempt to fill balloons with water using a water gun.
Lisa turns hers on Bart's.  Marge threatens to get the Kearney.

Bart and Lisa hock spit in the Whirly-Gig.  They both end up on
Milhouse.

At the bumper cars, Bart's car knocks Lisa's inoperative car out
of the arena.  She runs off crying.  And Bart can't help but feel
partially responsible.

At the beach house, Lisa sees her ex-friends apparently splatting
stuff on Homer's car.  Lisa tells them bitterly off.  But they've
actually been... well, putting stuff on Homer's car, but in a nice
shape.  (A bunch of shells reading "Lisa Rules")

You taught us about cool things like nature, and why we shouldn't
drink sea water.
-- Ben, 

 Lisa: This is the most thoughtful thing anyone has ever--
Homer: Sweet merciful crap!  My _car_!
-- Homer's car gets decorated, 

The family leave Little Pwagmattasquarmsettport, seagulls attacking
the car.  Bart shows Lisa her yearbook decked with signatures from
her friends.

Homer throws out a Buzz Cola can from the car before leaving the
beach.  The hermit crab finds it and uses it as its new home.

[End of Act Three.  Time: 21'29"]

Over the credits, the Beach Boys' "All Summer Long" plays:

       Sitting in my car outside your house
       Remember when you spilled Coke all over your blouse
       T-Shirts, cut-offs and a pair of thongs
       We've been having fun all summer long.
	 (instrumental continues for ~10 seconds)
       Won't be long till summertime is through
       Every now and then we hear our song...

The Gracie Films music is played on a sax, beach-music-like.

 EPISODE TITLE: Treehouse of Horror VII


EPISODE SUMMARY: 

First segment title: "The Thing and I"

The night has fallen upon Springfield, and everything is quiet.
However, Bart and Lisa are awakened by strange moaning and rattling
sounds.

Lisa: Did you hear that, Bart?
Bart: Maybe it was just the cat.
Lisa: No, she's sleeping with me.
       [Snowball II shows up, wearing a baby bonnet and booties]
-- Like child like cat, 

It appears the sounds originate from the attic. The next morning,
during breakfast, Bart asks Homer about it.

 Bart: Did you guys hear something moving around in the attic last
       night?
Homer: Attic? Oh, that's silly.  [laughs]  Seriously though, don't ever
       go up there.
-- What a frank attitude, 

Marge: Homer, isn't it about time for the... you know?
Homer: Yeah, yeah, I'll go feed it.
       [goes to the fridge, where he picks up a bucket of fish heads]
       [singing] Fish heads, fish heads, doo doo doo doo doo...
-- Nothing suspicious there, 

Homer whistles all the way to the attic, followed by Bart and Lisa.
They can't see what's going on in there, but the sound of animal
munching they hear is nothing to reassure them.

The following night, Bart not only hears, but also sees something
crawling in the air ducts. Come morning, the kids ask to be told the
truth.

 Lisa: What's up there?
 Bart: Is it a monster?
 Lisa: We have to know.
 Bart: Tell us what's the secret.
Homer: No more questions. I work my butt off to feed you four kids and
       all you do is...  [Marge is staring at him]  What?
Marge: Three. We have three kids, Homer.
Homer: Yeah, three nosy kids. And you know what happens to nosy kids
       who ask too many questions?
 Kids: [quickly]  No, what? Does something happen? Does something happen
       to nosy kids who ask questions? What happens?
-- Never mind, 

Since they cannot get any explanation from their parents, Bart and
Lisa decide to investigate the matter. After Homer and Marge go out
for a moment, they form a human ladder with Maggie, who opens the
attic's door.

Slowly and carefully, they step into the attic, where dozens of
useless items are stacked up, collecting dust. Among them, Bart
discovers the unsold copies of Homer's autobiography, "Homer, I Hardly
Knew Me". Lisa quickly directs his attention to a pair of restricting
chains, from which something has just escaped. The creature emerges in
the shadows and jumps right before the kids, causing them to run in
fear.

       [view of 3 vases, matching the kids' height]
Lisa: [muffled]  Bart, do you think it's safe?
Bart: [muffled]  I don't care -- I can't breathe in here!
       [the kids rush out of a nearby closet, gasping for air]
-- They still remember Tracey Ullman, 

At that moment, Homer and Marge come back into the house.

See, Marge, who needs a car-wash when you can just drive around in the
rain?
-- Homer, 

Bart+Lisa: [quickly]  Mom! Dad! We saw something in the attic! We saw
           something in the attic!
    Marge: You went into the attic?  [gasps]  I'm very disappointed and
           terrified.
-- Thanks for calming my fears, 

Armed with an iron club, Homer pokes his head into the attic, and
witnesses that "it" has escaped, leaving behind his chains and a dish
full of bones. The whole family gasps in horror when they hear rapid
footsteps and see the front door wide open.

Marge doesn't waste any time and picks up the phone.

Marge: Yes, doctor. It's what we've always feared: it's loose. Hugo is
       loose. See you soon!
-- Casual phonecalls, 

Of course, Bart and Lisa overheard.

 Bart: Who or what is Hugo?
Marge: Hmm. I'm afraid we haven't been entirely honest with you, Bart.
       You see... you have a brother.
 Lisa: So I have two brothers?
Homer: Lisa, please.  [pushes her aside]
-- 

Homer explains that Bart has in fact a twin brother: "When you were
born, there was an irregularity."  "A monstrous irregularity" adds Dr.
Hibbert, coming out of nowhere, much to Marge stupor.

Hibbert: Yes, I remember Bart's birth well. You don't forget a thing
         like... [dramatic] Siamese twins!
   Lisa: I believe they prefer to be called "conjoined twins".
Hibbert: And Hillbillies prefer to be called "sons of the soil". But it
         ain't gonna happen.
-- 

Dr. Hibbert narrates the birth of Bart and Hugo. It seems that one of
them was pure evil.

        [Hibbert shows Bart-Hugo to Marge]
        [one of them starts gnawing the other ferociously]
Marge: I think I'll bottle-feed that one.
-- 

Hibbert: The routine soul smear confirmed the presence of pure evil. It
         was then I knew the only option was to separate you two
         immediately.  [chops a paper cutter]
         [hands forms to Marge and Homer]  You'll both need to sign
         these.  [chuckles]
-- 

Hibbert: But what to do with poor Hugo? Too crazy for Boys Town, too
         much of a boy for Crazy Town. The child was an outcast. So, we
         did the only humane thing.
  Homer: We chained Hugo up in the attic like an animal and fed him a
         bucket of fish heads once a week.
  Marge: It's saved our marriage.
-- 

But Bart remains sceptic: "You expect me to believe all this? If any
of it was true, wouldn't I have a big hideous scar right --". Indeed,
the scar is there.

The family starts looking for Hugo.

Homer: We'll search out every place a sick twisted solitary misfit might
       run to.
 Lisa: I'll start with Radio Shack.
-- Hey, I used to hang out there!, 

Bart, you stay home and tape the hockey game.
-- Homer, 

Bart locks every door and window, until he hears rustling from inside
the house. "You're here, aren't you?" he realizes. His twin brother
comes out of the shadows, holding a glass and a plate of fish heads:
"Yes, Bart, I never left you." Bart inquires about what Hugo might
want from him. "You'll see, Hugo replies, after the surgery."

So here is Bart, tied up in the attic.

Hugo: I went mad after they tore us apart, but I'll be sane... once I
      sew us back together.
Bart: But you'll kill both of us.
Hugo: No, it's easy. Look, I've been practicing: I made a pigeon-rat.
       [said pigeon-rat flies into a wall, falls back, and tries to
       enter a mouse hole]
-- Natural evolution, 

Well, let's get started: you want to be on the right or the left?
-- Hugo, about to sew himself to Bart, 

Fortunately for Bart, Dr. Hibbert shows up right on time.

Hibbert: There, there, Hugo. I understand. All those years caged up in
         here, why, you've probably never ever seen your own face in the
         mirror, have you? Here.
          [Hibbert hands up a frame between him and Hugo]
   Hugo: Mmm?  [stares into the frame, which reveals Hibbert's face]
          [Hibbert punches him through the (empty) frame]
-- No need for violence, 

Homer and Marge step in.

We think we saw Hugo at the airport; he was boarding a plane to
Switzerland and...  [sees Hugo]  Oh.
-- Homer, 

Marge unties Bart while Hibbert and Homer take care of Hugo.

Hibbert: You know, isn't it interesting how the left -- or sinister --
         twin is invariably the evil one. I had this theory that... Wait
         a minute. Hugo's scar is on the wrong side. He couldn't have
         been the evil left twin. That means the evil twin is, and
         always has been... Bart!
   Bart: Oh, don't look so shocked.
Hibbert: Well, chalk this one up to carelessness on my part.
-- Pobody's Nerfect, 

Nevertheless, Hibbert thinks "there's a way to set everything right".

Later that day, everybody -- with Hugo in lieu of Bart -- is gathered
around the table for a nice family dinner.

Hibbert: Care for a drumstick, Hugo?
          [Hugo noisily eats his drumstick in 3 seconds, wipes his
          mouth, then starts eating the napkin]
   Lisa: Mom, Hugo's eating his napkin.
          [laughter]
   Bart: [from the air ducts]  Hey, can I have some turkey?
  Marge: No, you finish your fish heads. Then we'll talk.  [closes the
         vent]
-- 

[End of Act One.  Time: 7:00]

Segment two title: "The Genesis Tub"

In front of her mirror, Lisa looks at the newest gap in her dentition.

Lisa: This tooth will be perfect for my science project.
       [sets up her exhibit: "Will cola dissolve a tooth?"]
      Science has already proven the dangers of smoking, alcohol and
      chinese food, but I can still ruin soft drinks for everyone!
-- A lifetime mission, 

Bart: Hey, Lis. Check out my science project.  [rubs a balloon over
      his head, then touches Lisa with a spark of static electricity]
Lisa: Ow! What's that's supposed to prove?
Bart: That nerds conduct electricity.  [touches her again]
Lisa: Ow!
-- 

Bart runs away laughing, and Lisa gets back to her exhibit. When she
touches her tooth, now soaking in cola, she gets a shock again.
"Stupid Bart" she grumbles, not making much a case of it.

Throughout the night, Lisa sleeps deeply, while the tooth and the cola
seem to undergo some sort of strange electrical reaction. Come
morning, Lisa wakes up and looks at her experiment.

Oh boy, mold! That's science fair pay dirt.
-- I can't hold my excitement, 

She brings the tub under her microscope for further analysis. "Looks
about the same" she complains, until she notices the microscope is set
for 1x magnification. She brings it to 10x, then 100x, to find
something shocking: miniature prehistoric human lifeform.

 Lisa: [gasps]  Tiny little people! My God! I've created life!
Marge: Lisa! Breakfast! We're having waffles!
 Lisa: Ooh! Waffles!  [runs down]
-- The meal of choice of Darwin, 

She gets disappointed once she reaches her seat, as the promised
waffles are "just square pancakes", the waffle iron being in the shop.
"The waffle iron's been in the shop forever" she grumbles back to her
room.

Taking another look at her microscope, she is stunned to observe that
her "little stone age tub dwellers" have already evolved into the
Renaissance.

Wait, one of them is nailing something to the door of the cathedral.
[gasps]  I've created Lutherans!
-- Lisa, 

During the night, light emerges from the tub, lighting up the whole
room. The following day, the tub has already evolved well beyond our
own world. Lisa marvels to this sight of our own possible future.

Bart steps in and inquires about her project; when he sees what seems
like a model city, he squashes some bits of it ("Oops, my finger
slipped"), and runs away laughing. Looking back at her microscope,
Lisa witnesses the damage he's caused.

The following night, a squadron of spaceships launch from the tub and
proceed to attack Bart for a short time before they come back to their
base. Bearing many bumps on the face, the boy bursts into Lisa's room,
ready to strike back. Lisa stops him in time.

Bart: Your micro-jerks attacked me!
Lisa: Well, you practically destroyed their whole world.
Bart: You can't protect them every second. Sooner or later, you'll let
      your guard down, and then flush: it's toilet time for Tinytown.
-- 

Bart leaves, and Lisa sits next to the tub, expressing a long sigh.
Her attention is suddenly caught by a whirring sound from the tub,
followed by some sort of energy which surrounds her, shrinking her and
bringing her into the tub. She is dropped on a tooth-shaped seat, in
front of an audience which seems to comprise every man and woman in
this world.

A Frink-like man rejoices.

It worked! The de-bigulator world!
-- Tiny Frink, 

The audience hails her, and what seems to be a spiritual leader greets
her.

Leader: Welcome to our world, most gracious Lisa.
  Lisa: Your world is incredible. And you speak English.
Leader: We have listened to you speak since the dawn of time, O Creator.
        And we have learned to imatoot you exarktly.
-- Close enough, 

The audience bows, revealing a statue of Lisa. She then realizes that
she is granted the status of godhood, as she is the one who created
this world. In that aspect, those people are counting on her to save
them from the devil, ie. Bart.

When she announces that the devil is her brother, murmurs emerge from
the audience. Gradually, people come forward with the usual boring
theological questions (why does a good god allow bad things).

 Lisa: Listen, I can take care of everything. All you have to do is
       unshrink me.
Frink: Unshrink you? Well, that would require some sort of a
       re-bigulator, which is a concept so ridiculous is makes me want
       to laugh out loud and chortle, and...  [Lisa looks at him]  uh...
       but not at you, O holiest of gods, with the wrathfulness and the
       vengeance and the blood rain and the hey-hey-hey-it-hurts-me...
-- 

His words are quickly covered by screams from the audience, as the
grinning face of Bart appears in the sky. He closes the tub, which is
later opened by... Principal Skinner.

First-rate work, Bart. This universe you've created is even more
impressive than Martin's milk-carton ukulele.
-- Principal Skinner, 

Skinner nominates Bart as winner, and instructs Willy to throw out the
other projects. Children moan.

Principal Skinner, wait! I created the universe! Give me the gift
certificate!
-- Lisa, 

Lisa: Oh, great. I'm stuck in this lousy tub for the rest of my life.
       [people stare at her]
      Shouldn't you people be grovelling?
       [they do]
      And bring me some shoes. Nice ones.
 Man: She'll want socks, too. I'll get socks.
-- 

[End of Act Two.  Time: 12:52]

Third segment title: "Citizen Kang"

Late at night, Homer is relaxing on a boat.

Homer: Ah... The old fishin' hole. So peaceful and relaxing, doesn't
       even matter if I catch a single fish.  [yawns]
       [pauses, then abruptly springs forward]
       Come on, you stupid fish! Take the bait! Don't make me come down
       there!
-- The pleasures of fishing, 

His attention is quickly grabbed by nothing else than a flying saucer
over him. The saucer drops a crane and brings him on board -- after
dropping him in the lake once.

His abductors are none else than... Kang and Kodos!

Oh, my God. Space aliens. Don't eat me! I have a wife and kids! Eat
them!
-- Homer faces alien abduction, 

 Kang: Silence! We are travellers from a certain nearby ringed planet
       whose name we'd prefer not to mention.
       My name is Kang, and this is my sister Kodos.
Kodos: [masculine voice]  Hello.
-- Charmed, 

Homer: [gulps]  I suppose you want to probe me. Well, might as well get
       it over with.  [unzips his pants]
 Kang: [disgusted]  Stop! We have reached the limits of what rectal
       probing can teach us.
-- And what a passionating subject, 

Kodos explains that they're on a mission of conquest, and need to
locate Earth's leader.

Homer: I guess you mean President Clinton. He usually hangs around
       Washington, D.C.
 Kang: President Clin-Ton? Excellent.
Homer: Except, um... there's this election next week, so after that, it
       might not be him anymore. It might be what's-his-name, uh...
       Mumbly Joe, uh... I saw him on TV the other... uh... Bob Dole!
-- The well-informed American voter, 

This election complicates matters a bit, so Kang and Kodos decide to
abduct both candidates.

Their first target is Bob Dole, who's walking out of the Republican
National Committee.

Ugh, Bob Dole doesn't need this.
-- Bob Dole being abducted by aliens, 

Next is Bill Clinton, who they pull through the roof of the White
House, still in bed.

Wha-wha-wha what's happening? Is it noon already?
-- Bill Clinton being abducted by aliens, 

Dole and Clinton are stripped bare naked (urgh!) and pushed into some
kind of tube.

What the hell is this, some kind of tube?
-- Bob Dole, in some kind of tube, 

Dole's tube quickly fills up with some sort of fluid which stops his
movements, yet keeps him alive. Clinton thanks Kang and Kodos for
taking care of Dole for him, but he soon goes through the same
process.

The aliens link themselves to the tubes, and initiate a
bio-duplication. In other words, Kang and Kodos take the shape of Dole
and Clinton, respectively.

Oh, no! Aliens, bio-duplication, nude conspiracies... Oh my God! Lyndon
LaRouche was right!
-- Homer, 

Kodos: What? Are you still here? I'm afraid we'll have to dispose of
       you...  [pushes a button]
        [out of somewhere comes a cannon, which reveals a smaller
        cannon, which reveals an even smaller one, from which emerges a
        tube, spraying Homer]
Homer: What are you spraying me with?
 Kang: Rum. So no one will believe your story.
        [Kodos kicks Homer off the saucer]
Kodos: And don't come back.
-- That should take care of him, 

The next morning, Marge and the kids watch a portable TV in the
kitchen.

 Kent: Kent Brockman here, with Campaign '96: America Flips A Coin. At
       an appearance this morning, Bill Clinton made some rather cryptic
       remarks, which aides attributed to an overly tight necktie.
Kodos: I am Clin-Ton. As overlord, all will kneel trembling before me
       and obey my brutal commands.  [crosses arms]  End communication.
Marge: Hmm, that's Slick Willie for you, always with the smooth talk.
-- 

Homer runs in.

Marge! Marge! There I was, I had just caught the largest fish you'd ever
seen, when I was abducted by a flying saucer!
-- Homer, catching up the fisherman profile, 

"Sure you were, rummy" replies Bart. Homer gasps when he sees Dole on
the screen.

Kent: Senator Dole, why should people vote for you instead of President
      Clinton?
Kang: It makes no difference which one of us you vote for. Either way,
      your planet is doomed. DOOMED!
Kent: Well, a refreshingly frank response there from senator Bob Dole.
-- 

These candidates make me wanna vomit in terror!
-- Homer speaks out loud what we think, 

Bob Dole gives an electoral speech:

Announcer: Ladies and Gentlemen, 73-year-old candidate, Bob Dole.
     Kang: Abortions for all.
            [crowd boos]
           Very well, no abortions for anyone.
            [crowd boos]
           Hmm... Abortions for some, miniature American flags for
           others.
            [crowd cheers and waves miniature flags]
-- American politics in its simplicity, 

Later, Kang and Kodos are walking down the streets, holding hands.

 Kang: Fooling these Earth voters is easier than expected.
Kodos: Yes. All they want to hear are bland pleasantries embellished by
       an occasional saxophone solo or infant kiss.
-- 

A Democratic National Committee van pulls up, and George
Stephanopoulos pokes his head out.

George: Uh, Mr. President, Sir. People are becoming a bit... confused by
        the way your and your opponent are, well, constantly holding
        hands.
  Kang: We are merely exchanging long protein strings. If you can think
        of a simpler way, I'd like to hear it.
-- 

One night, Springfield holds a Dole-Clinton debate. Clinton is giving
the opening speech:

My fellow Americans. As a young boy, I dreamed of being a baseball, but
tonight I say, we must move forward, not backward, upward not forward,
and always twirling, twirling, twirling towards freedom.
-- Kodos gives a speech, 

The crowd is cheering heartily, and Dole is about to take the stand,
when Homer comes bursting in.

Homer: Stop! Those candidates are phonies!
        [crowd murmurs]
       You heard me! They're alien replicons from beyond the moon!
        [crowd laughs at him]
-- You just said the "A" word, 

Homer tries to prevent secret agents from throwing him out by using a
flag as defence, but to no avail. "Don't forget your stinking flag"
says one, before throwing it at him.

Dejected, Homer takes a walk by the shore of a lake.

Why won't anyone believe my crazy story?
-- Homer, 

In frustration, he kicks a bush, only to hit metal. Removing the bush,
he discovers the aliens' spaceship -- clearly visible anyway. Inside,
he removes the liquid from the tubes, re-animating the real
candidates.

Clinton: Oh, no, am I still here? I don't wanna serve out my term naked
         in a tube...
   Dole: I am so mad at the Secret Service right now.
-- Clinton and Dole wake up, 

Homer takes the ship in space, flying towards Washington.

Clinton: You know, Senator, being in suspended animation gave me time to
         think. Partisan politics are tearing our country apart.
   Dole: You got a point there, Bill. If you and I are gonna whup these
         one-eyed space fellas, we're gonna have to set aside our
         differences.
Clinton: Together, we can lead America into a new Golden Age.
   Dole: Friend, you got a deal. 
-- But enough with the fairy tales, 

Dole asks Homer to get them out of those tubes, but Homer somehow
manages to press the wrong button, and sends them both flying into
space.

Oh, no. What have I done? What am I doing? What will I do?
-- That is the question, 

In panic, Homer smashes the control panel, and sends the saucer
crashing towards Washington.

Meanwhile, outside the Capitol, the candidates are giving their last
electoral speach.

 Kang: The politics of failure have failed. We need to make them work
       again. Tomorrow, when you are sealed in the voting cubicle, vote
       for me, Senator Ka... Bob Dole.
        [applause]
Kodos: I am looking forward to an orderly election tomorrow, which will
       eliminate the need for a violent blood bath.
        [applause]
-- Pre-electoral speeches, 

From the sky comes a scream, as Homer is crashing right into the
Capitol. A few footsteps later, he comes running down the stairs.

Homer: America, take a good look at your beloved candidates. They're
       nothing but hideous space reptiles.  [unmasks them]
        [audience gasps in terror]
Kodos: It's true, we are aliens. But what are you going to do about
       it? It's a two-party system; you have to vote for one of us.
        [murmurs]
 Man1: He's right, this is a two-party system.
 Man2: Well, I believe I'll vote for a third-party candidate.
 Kang: Go ahead, throw your vote away.
        [Kang and Kodos laugh out loud]
        [Ross Perot smashes his "Perot 96" hat]
-- 

The next day, Kodos announces the result: "All hail, President Kang."

The field in front of the Capitol has now become a working ground
where humans are whipped by aliens and used to carry materials.

The Simpsons family is working too, with Homer and the kids carrying
wood, and Marge pushing a wheelbarrow of cinderblocks -- with Maggie
on top.

Marge: I don't understand why we have to build a ray gun to aim at a
       planet I never even heard of.
Homer: Don't blame me, I voted for Kodos.

[End of Act Three.  Time: 21:28]

 EPISODE TITLE: You Only Move Twice


EPISODE SUMMARY: 

It's a beautiful day in Springfield, and Waylon Smithers comes out of
his house.

[to the tune of "Hooray for Hollywood"]
I work for Monty Burns,
Muh-muh-muh-muh-muh-muh-muh Monty Burns.
-- What keeps Waylon Smithers alive, 

As he merrily hums on his walk to work, a limousine slows down to his
pace and a woman offers him a ride -- which he kindly refuses.
Nonetheless, she explains to him that Globex Corporation would be
interested in hiring him, offering an impressive salary plus health
benefit for him and his "life partner". Smithers gets annoyed.

What's wrong with this country? Can't a man walk down the street without
being offered a job?
-- Smithers' view of America, 

With Smithers out of question, Globex chooses the next most senior
employee, which happens to be... Homer. He explains the whole deal to
Marge, but the job requires them to move to Cypress Creek.

Marge: You took a new job in a strange town without discussing it with
       your family?
Homer: Of course not. I wouldn't do that!  [pause]  Why not?
Marge: We have roots here, Homer. We have friends and family and library
       cards... Bart's lawyer is here.
-- All the essential commodities, 

Homer: But, Marge, this is a chance for me to fulfil my lifelong dream.
Marge: What lifelong dream?
-- Just pick one from the list, 

Homer: Promise not to laugh? I always wanted to own the Dallas Cowboys.
        [Bart and Lisa laugh]
 Lisa: I'm sorry, Dad. I just find that very cute.
-- 

But Marge isn't happy at all with the idea of leaving her town.

Marge: I've dug myself into a happy little rut here and I'm not about to
       hoist myself out of it.
Homer: Just bring the rut with ya, Honey.
-- 

Homer doesn't give up, and loads a promotional video in the VCR.

   TV: "Cypress Creek: The Tale of One City".
Homer: Uh, let's watch something else.
Marge: Homer, you're trying to talk us into moving to this place.
Homer: Oh, yeah, that's right. Let's watch this.
-- The power of conviction, 

The promotional video is as crappy as you could imagine, picturing an
ugly suburb, plagued with criminality, which turns into the perfect
community; parking meters become trees, abandoned warehouses become
coffee shops, and a bum becomes a mailbox.

Announcer #1: Cypress Creek: where dreams come true.
Announcer #2: [quickly] Your dreams may vary from those of Globex
              Corporation, its subsidiaries and shareholders.
-- A fair warning, 

Homer: Well, what do you think of me and Cypress Creek now, Marge?
Marge: It does seem nicer than Springfield.
 Lisa: Yeah, did you notice how the people weren't shoving or knocking
       each other down? I've never been to a place like that before.
 Bart: [shoves her aside]  Me neither.
-- 

Since Cypress Creek looks like a nice town, the job would pay more,
and the house is falling apart (vouched by the chimney crumbling),
Marge agrees to move. That is, as soon as they can sell the house...

Oh, wow! Windows!
-- Otto takes a look at the house, 

The next visitor is Apu:

  Apu: Hello. I am not interested in buying your house, but I would like
       to use your rest room, flip through your magazines, rearrange
       your carefully shelved items and handle your food products in an
       unsanitary manner. Ha! Now you know how it feels!  [runs off]
Homer: Thank you. Come again.
-- Getting things off his chest, 

But despite the number of visitors, no one is interested in buying
this crumbling house. Proving their point, Bart nearly falls through
the roof, and Marge has to push him up with a broom.

      Marge: Even if we sell the house, we still don't come close to
             paying off the mortgage.
              [pause]
Homer+Marge: [getting a flash] Hey...
              [Homer nails an "Abandoned" sign to the door]
-- The answer to all your mortgage problems, 

Homer and Marge make the final preparations for their moving.

  Ned: Uh, huh-huh... Homer, ah... About those things you borrowed from
       me over the years, you know, the TV trays, the power sander, the
       downstairs bathtub... You gonna be... needing those things in
       Cypress Creek?
Homer: Yes.
  Ned: Oh. Uh...
Homer: [reciting] Okily dokily...
  Ned: Okily dokily!
-- 8 years of Ned-handling, 

And off they go, greeted by everybody in Springfield.

Homer: I'm gonna miss Springfield. This town's been awfully good to us.
 Bart: No, it hasn't, Dad. That's why we're leaving.
Homer: Oh, yeah.  [pokes his head out the window]  So long, Stinktown!
-- And thus it ends, 

[End of Act One. Time: 4:46]

OFF drives through the woods around Cypress Creek.

It says here, one of these giant redwood trees can provide enough
sawdust to cover an entire day's worth of vomit at Disneyland.
-- Lisa reads the Cypress Creek brochure, 

After much "ooh"s, "ah"s and "oh"s, they finally reach their
destination: 15201 Maple Systems Road. This house is bigger than they
never could've imagined -- or afforded; the living room itself, which
Bart calls immediately, could easily hold the whole 1st floor of their
previous house.

They are quickly greeted by Hank Scorpio, Globex's president.

Homer: Wow, my boss.
 Hank: Don't call me that word. I don't like things that elevate me
       about the other people. I'm just like you. Oh, sure, I come later
       in the day, I get paid a lot more and I take longer vacations,
       but I don't like the word "boss".
-- Though I like its income, 

 Hank: Hey, look at my feet. You like those moccasins? Look in your
       closet; there's a pair for you. Don't like them? Then neither do
       I! [throws them out]  Get the hell outta here! Ever see a guy say
       good-bye to a shoe?
Homer: [chuckles]  Yes, once.
-- 

Marge: Mr. Scorpio, this house is almost too good for us. I keep
       expecting to get the bum's rush.
 Hank: We don't have bums in our town, Marge, and if we did they
       wouldn't rush; they'd be allowed to go at their own pace.
-- The spirit of Cypress Creek, 

After a few words, Hank rushed back to the fun run he was into,
looking forward to see Homer at work -- although he doesn't like to
call it "work".

The next day, everybody meets with his/her new life in Cypress Creek.

Marge: Okay, the oven is cleaning itself, the autovac's on dirt patrol,
       and Maggie's enjoying her Swing-A-Majig.
        [said Maggie tries desperately to reach the "off" switch]
       I can't believe it. I've done all my housework, and it's only
       9:30.  [looses her smile]
       Well, better go upstairs and make sure the beds are still made.
-- Some tough competition, 

At work, Homer gets acquainted with his new environment, especially
his boss.

 Hank: You will notice, my new best friend, that we are pretty casual
       around here.
Homer: Yes, sir. I will notice that. Very casual, Mr. Scorpion.
-- Preaching by the example, 

Mr. "Scorpion" urges Homer to call him Hank, and proceeds to initiate
him to the local atmosphere.

 Hank: Would you mind hanging my coat up on the wall, please?
Homer: Mm-hmm.  [taking his coat]  Hmm, uh, let's see...
        [the floor is one big room, with windows all around]
       Um, uh, well, uh...
 Hank: [laughs]  Relax, Homer. At Globex, we don't believe in walls.
       Matter of fact, I didn't even give you my coat.
Homer: Mmm?  [his hands are indeed empty]
        [Hank is now wearing his coat]
       Wow.
-- Better than Houdini and Copperfield put together,
      

While they exercise a little on a treadmill, Hank tells Homer that
Globex was his lifelong dream. They next step on a moving sidewalk,
and Homer confides his own lifelong dream. Hank understands: "They
laughed at me the first time I wore jeans with a sport coat."

They step in Homer's workstation, where three people busily working on
computers welcome them.

These gentlemen here will be your eyes and your ears, and should the
need arise, they'll fill in for any other part of your body.
-- Which one's the beer belly?, 

 Hank: Your job will be to manage and motivate them. Give 'em the
       benefit of your years of experience.
Homer: Don't worry, that won't take long.
-- About two minutes and a half, 

 Hank: The key to motivation is trust. Let me show you what I mean. I
       want you to close your eyes and fall backwards, and I'll catch
       you. That's gonna show you what trust is all about. Ready?
Homer: Right.
 Hank: Three... Two...  [phone rings]  One second...
        [Hank answers the phone and Homer falls to the ground]
       Oh, my God, the guy's on the floor.
       Uh, that was a phone call; don't chalk that up to mistrust, now.
-- 

The phone call was carrying bad news: somebody ate part of Hank's
lunch. He must leave to investigate the matter.

 Hank: I'm gonna leave everything to you. We're on a tight schedule. You
       keep them motivated.  [he leaves]
        [his staff is busily working]
Homer: [to staff]  Are you guys working?
Man 1: Yes, sir, Mr. Simpson.
Homer: Could you, um... work any harder than this?
Man 2: Sure thing, boss.
        [they do]
Homer: Hey, call me Homer.
-- You too can learn my secrets to successful mananagement,
      

The other half of the family, namely the kids, step in for their first
day at Cypress Creek Elementary. Bart manages to fit in pretty well,
by doing some armpit noises.

Kid 1: You got a fresh sound. It'll play well at this school.
Kid 2: [looking a lot like Milhouse]  Hey, Bart, do you have a best
       friend yet? 'Cause I've been looking for someone to boss me
       around.
-- That's hard to find around here, 

Unfortunately for Bart, things get bad once the grammar course starts,
as cursive writing is giving problems to him.

Teacher: So, you never learned cursive?
   Bart: Um, well, I know hell and damn and bit...
-- Saved by the bleep, 

It seems Bart is years behind of schedule, so he's transferred to a
"more remedial environment", ie. the leg-up program.

At home, the situation isn't that bright either when Marge find out
that automatic sprinklers are watering the flowers. In fact,
everything is just perfect, which leaves her with nothing else to do
than to sip a glass of wine.

Back to school, Bart meets with his new classmates.

  Bart: So, what are you in for?
 Gordy: [slowly and strangely sounding]  I moved here from Canada, and
        they think I'm slow, eh?
   Dot: I fell off the jungle gym and when I woke up I was in here.
Warren: I start fires.
-- Dead Leg-Up Society, 

Teacher: Okay. Now, everyone take out your safety pencil and a circle of
         paper. This week, I hope we can finish our work on the letter
         "A".
   Bart: Let me get this straight. We're behind the rest of our class
         and we're going to catch up to them by going slower than they
         are?  [making "crazy" gesture]  Cuckoo.
   Kids: [imitating him]  Cuckoo. Cuckoo. Cuckoo. Cuckoo.
Teacher: Stop it! Stop it! Warren! Melvin! Gary! Dot! Gordy!
-- My new menagerie, 

   Bart: Listen lady, I'm s'pose to be in the fourth grade.
Teacher: Seems to me that someone's got a case of the "s'pose'das".
   Bart: [moans]
          [Warren pats him on the back thrice, but on the fourth time,
          he just smacks him]
Teacher: Warren!
-- 

Up to this point, the only Simpson who seems to be enjoying herself is
Lisa, as she gazes upon the beauties of the neighborhood woods.

Lisa: [to a nearby chipmunk]  Hello, Mr. Chipmunk. You're a northern
      reticulated chipmunk. Yes, you are.  [pokes its nose]  You are so
      reticulated.
      [to an owl]  Hi, Mrs. Owl. You're out kind of early.
      [walks off merrily]  La-la-la, la-la...
       [as soon as she's out, the owl grabs the chipmunk]
-- Better than Time Life, 

After a day of good and bad events for everyone, the whole family
takes a walk in Cypress Creek Promenade.

Mr. Scorpio says productivity is up two percent, and it's all because of
my motivational techniques. Like, donuts. And a possibility of more
donuts to come.
-- Homer's second secret to successful management, 

Bart's attention is brought by The Spend Zone, a shop full of sports
collectible.

Wow, a baseball made out of Secretariat!
-- Bart gazes upon the Spend Zone, 

Homer: [gasps]  Tom Landry's hat, and it's autographed. "To Berman's Dry
       Cleaning. Best wishes, Tom Landry."
 Bart: Why don't you buy it?
Homer: I can't buy that. Only management-type guys with big salaries
       like me can afford things like that.
       [gasps]  Guys like me! I'm a guy like me!
-- He's getting it, 

At work, Homer's wearing his Tom Landry hat and coaching his team, but
they're quite exhausted from the work he's asking from them. From
experience, Homer knows that fatigue requires only one solution:
hammocks. He goes straight to his "boss".

 Hank: Uh, hi, Homer. What can I do for you?
Homer: Sir, I need to know where I can get some business hammocks.
 Hank: Hammocks? My goodness, what an idea. Why didn't I think of that?
       Hammocks! Homer, there's four places. There's the Hammock Hut,
       that's on third.
Homer: Uh-huh.
 Hank: There's Hammocks-R-Us, that's on third too. You got
       Put-Your-Butt-There?
Homer: Mm-Hmm.
 Hank: That's on third. Swing Low, Sweet Chariot... Matter of fact,
       they're all in the same complex; it's the hammock complex on
       third.
Homer: Oh, the hammock district.
 Hank: That's right.
-- 

Hank's secretary tells him they're ready for the linkup.

 Hank: Uh, Homer, one second. I gotta take care of this. Very important.
       Be right back.
Homer: Fine.
        [Hank's map of the world reveals a giant viewscreen, on which
        appears the UN staff]
 Hank: Good afternoon, gentlemen. This is Scorpio. I have the Doomsday
       Device. You have 72 hours to deliver the gold or you'll face the
       consequences. And to prove I'm not bluffing, watch this.
       [activates a remote]
        [an explosion occurs near the UN building]
Man 1: Oh, my God, the 59th Street bridge!
Man 2: Maybe it just collapsed on its own.
Man 1: We can't take that chance.
Man 2: You always say that. I want to take a chance.
 Hank: Collapsed on its own? You, sh... You have 72 hours. See ya.
       [to Homer]  Back to the hammocks, my friend. You know, there's a
       little place called Mary Ann's Hammocks. The nice thing about
       that place is Mary Ann gets in the hammock with you.  [laughs]
       I'm just kidding.
Homer: Oh.
 Hank: You know who invented the hammock, Homer?
Homer: No.
 Hank: That's something for you to do. Find that out.
-- Hammocks and world domination, 

[End of Act Two. Time: 14:41]

Homer's wandering around in the complex, in search of sugar. One guard
directs him to a security door, which leads to what seems the inside
of a mountain. The huge room is filled with machinery, control panels
and such. Hank is inside, and tells Homer he hopes to see the nuclear
generator up and running by tomorrow.

 Hank: By the way, Homer, what's your least favorite country: Italy or
       France?
Homer: France.
 Hank: [chuckles]  Nobody ever says Italy.  [sets the coordinates of a
       giant laser gun]
-- Casual discussion, 

Homer: Uh... you have any sugar around here?
 Hank: Sugar? Sure.  [fumbles in his pockets, takes out a few handfuls
       of sugar]  There you go. Sorry it's not in packages. Want some
       cream?
Homer: Uh... I... no.
-- That's the right answer, 

Homer might be at ease with his new job, but the other members of the
family are not as comfortable. Marge still has nothing else to do than
take another sip of wine. And Bart's stuck in playing musical chair,
leg-up version: 12 chairs for 7 people, and a silly Barney-like "I
like me" song playing on a vinyl record.

   Kids: [singing to the tune]
         I like me
         I like me
         I'm as good as I can be
         With a smile and a wave and a happy melody
         I'm as good as...  [slowing as they see the teacher reaching
         for the record player]  I...  [slowly taking places]
Teacher: Hooray! Everyone's a winner!
   Bart: [groans]
-- And that's how we help them catch up, 

Even Lisa's life at Cypress Creek is going down, as she proves to be
allergic to almost every plant there is in the nearby forest.

Back to work, while Homer attends to great preoccupations (ie. trying
to get the snack machine into taking his dollar bill), Scorpio is
taking care of a good friend of his, a la Goldfinger.

Hank: Ingenious, isn't it, Mr. Bont?
Bont: Scorpio, you're totally mad.
Hank: Heh, I wouldn't point fingers, you jerk.
Bont: So, do you expect me to talk?
Hank: I don't expect anything from you except to die and be a very cheap
      funeral.  [leaves]  You're gonna die, now.
-- Not unless my contract says so, 

But Bont has an ace up his sleave (doesn't he always?), and uses a
quarter to deflect the laser to his chains. A shot of sleeping gas
towards the guards, and he's off to the exit.

 Hank: Stop him! He's supposed to die!
        [Homer jumps on Bont who was running past him]
       Nice work, Homer! Am I proud of you.
Homer: [shy] Well...
 Hank: When you go home tonight, there's gonna be another story on your
       house.  [they both walk off]  Thank you.
        [guards shoot Bont off-screen]
-- Just doing my job, 

That night at home, Homer tries to recite his day at work, but all
other members of the family look much depressed.

 Lisa: I'b allergic to everythig here. By nose is so stuffed ub, I
       can't eben taste Mob's delicious boiled celery.
Marge: I've been so bored since we moved here, I found myself drinking a
       glass of wine every day. I know doctors say you should drink a
       glass and a half but I just can't drink that much.
Homer: Well, the Simpson men are doing fine, right Bart? You haven't
       even gotten in trouble at school.
 Bart: I can't get in trouble at school, they put me in the remedial
       class. I'm surrounded by arsonists and kids with mittens pinned
       to their jackets all year 'round.
-- 

This said, they all ask to move back to Springfield, but Homer is
reluctant.

We've got it great, here. And for the first time in my life, I'm
actually good at my job. My team is way ahead of the weather machine and
germ warfare divisions.
-- Homer, 

Marge leaves the decision to Homer, saying they'll go where he goes.

The next morning, it's with a sad face that Homer walks up to his
boss, who's busily repelling army troops in order to launch his
"Doomsday Device" in time.

Homer: Say, what's going on?
 Hank: I'm having a little trouble with the government.
Homer: Oh, those jerks always walking over the small businessman. Don't
       get me started about the government.
-- 

Homer tells him his family wants to move back.

 Hank: Let them go. You'll stay here with me, we'll go bowling.
        [a burning man runs by]
       What's bothering them?
        [troops are shooting at each other]
Homer: Nothing big. It's just a lot of little things.
 Hank: Well, you can't argue with the little things. It's the little
       things that make up life.  [throws a grenade]
-- 

Hank advises him to do what's best for his family. Homer thanks him
for everything he's done.

 P.A.: T minus 14 seconds.
 Hank: If you need anything, you call me.
Homer: All right. What's the number?
 Hank: I've never had to call my own company. Someone will tell you
       upstairs. But, Homer, on your way out, if you wanna kill
       somebody, it would help a lot.
       [goes off to use a flamethrower on the troops]
-- Anything for you, 

So, they're back to their normal town and their normal house, with a
pile of newspapers waiting for them. The most recent one talks about
Scorpio's conquest of the East coast.

On the living room's floor is Otto and a couple of beer cans.

Let me just get my girlfriend, and I'll go. Hey, Crystal, wake up!
-- Otto leaves OFF's house, 

The doorbell rings; it's a telegram for Homer.

Homer: [reading] "Project Arcturus couldn't have succeeded without you.
       This will get you a little closer to that dream of yours. It's
       not the Dallas Cowboys, but it's a start. Drop me a line if
       you're on the East Coast, Hank Scorpio."
        [a whole football team is on his lawn]
       [disappointed] Aw, the Denver Broncos!
Marge: I think owning the Denver Broncos is pretty good.
        [a player tries to catch the ball, but falls]
Homer: Yeah, yeah.
Marge: Well, explain to me why it isn't.
        [another player tries to catch, but hits the ball with his head]
Homer: [sighs]  You just don't understand football, Marge.
-- 

[End of Act Three. Time: 20:53]

Credits roll on "Scorpio".


 EPISODE TITLE: The Homer They Fall


EPISODE SUMMARY:   {ol}

At the Springfield Mall, a crowd (including the family), is gathered
to watch "Memories of Bonanza, The Mall Show", presented by Nostalgia
Licensing Corporation.

The theme music to "Bonanza" begins as a fire spreads, and burns a
hole through the stage curtain which looks like a map (reminiscent of
the "Bonanza" theme song).  A man walks on stage and extinguishes the
fire as two shirtless native Indians walk through the hole in the
curtain on stage.  The audience applauds.

Indian #1: Thank you.  I just wish Ben and Hoss and Little Joe and Hop
           Sing and Sheriff Roy and all your favorites could be alive
           today to see this wonderful turnout.
Indian #2: You know, on the series, we were always trying to kill the
           Cartwrights.
            [audience boos]
           But it looks like Father Time took care of that for us,
           right?  [pause]  Am I right, folks?
            [the audience doesn't respond, so the two Indians motion for
            the theme song to play again, which they dance to]
     Bart: Oh, this sucks.
    Marge: Weren't there three Indians last year?
-- 

The family tours the mall, when they happen upon the store
"Miscellaneous Etc."

Homer: Look, Marge!  They opened a new high-tech gadget store!  You love
       high-tech gadgets.
Marge: No, I don't.
Homer: Like bull you don't.  Come on.
        [leadingly grabs Marge's arm]
Marge: Homer, please!  You're hurting my arm.
Homer: [obliviously] No I'm not.
-- 

Bart: Hey, Lis! Check out this space-age toothbrush.  [uses it]
Lisa: That's an electric nostril groomer.
Bart: [spits and coughs]

Marge: Night vision goggles?  A bathroom scale from a soviet sub?  A
       suede briefcase case?  [growls]  Anyone who needs this kind of
       status symbol must have some terrible emotional problems.
Homer: [gasping]  Marge, look!  "The world's best jacket."  If I had
        this, it would show everybody!  [angrily] Show everybody!
-- The insecurity jacket, 

The Comic Book Guy is busy arguing with a salesman about an
unsatisfactory purchase.

     CBG: Yes, finally!  I would like to return your quote, unquote
          Ultimate Belt.
Salesman: I see.  Do you have a receipt, quote, unquote, sir?
     CBG: No, I do not have a receipt.  I won it as a door prize at the
          Star Trek Convention, although I find their choice of prize
          highly illogical, as the average Trekker has no use for a
          medium-sized belt.
Salesman: Whoa! Whoa!  A fat, sarcastic Star Trek fan.  You must be a
          devil with the ladies.  [sarcastic wink]
     CBG: Hey, I...  [sighs]  That...  Oh...
Salesman: Gee, I hate to let you down, Casanova, but, uh, no receipt, no
          return.  [walks away]
    Bart: I'll give you four bucks for it.
     CBG: [sighs, then sells him the belt]
          Very well.  I must hurry back to my comic book store, where I
          dispense the insults rather than absorb them.
-- A taste of his own medicine, 

Bart is at school showing off his gadget-surrounded belt to his
friends in the hall.

Wow!  I bet if God wore pants, he'd have a belt like that!
-- Milhouse admires Bart's belt, 

Bart enumerates all the features of his "Tactical Pants-Retaining
System": compass, matches, whistle, saw, panic button, squirrel snare,
radon/lie detector, sphygmomanometer and cute turn signals. He turns
around to show left and right arrows on the backside of the belt, which
wows his peers, but they flee when Jimbo, Dolph and Kearney walk up to
Bart.

  Jimbo: Hey Simpson, wanna trade belts?
   Bart: Well, not really, 'cause yours is just a piece of extension
         cord.
          [close-in of a cord wrapped around Jimbo's pants]
Kearney: Hey, dude, he's ragging on your cord.
  Jimbo: Get him!
-- Never joke about the cord, 

The bullies jump at Bart, who breaks away and starts running down the
hall. Water-drinking Janey exclaims "No running!"  Jimbo, Kearney and
Dolph continue to chase Bart.  "Time for a little evasive action,"
panics Bart as he pushes the button that "indicates" that he's turning
left.  He runs a little towards the left hall, then runs right.  He
throws off his hunters for a while, then presses the "Help" button on
his belt, which starts a voice that incessantly cries "Help, help,
help..."  Bart's immediately spotted.

Bart: I was hoping it wouldn't come to this, but... you guys asked for
      it.  [pushes the "Emergency Use Only" button]
       [a small parachute emerges, carrying a "Call police" sign]
      Can't you read?!  Call the police!
       [the bullies beat him]
-- 

Bart returns home with bruises, a black eye and his shirt torn up.  He
passes pie-eating Homer.

 Bart: [all bruised up]  Hey, dad.
Homer: Looking good, son.  [stops Bart]  Hey!  What happened to your
       belt?
-- The caringest father in the world, 

Bart explains.

      Homer: Son, there's only one thing punks like that understand:
             squealing. You've got to squeal to every teacher and every
             grown-up you can find. Coming to me was a good start.
       Bart: But then they'll just beat me up even worse!
      Homer: Yes, they are a clever bunch.  I know.  I'll squeal for
             ya... to their parents!
              [later that day...]
Jimbo's dad: [punches him in the face]  That's for telling me how to
             raise my lousy kid!
Dolph's dad: [punches him in the gut]  This is for the crummy life I've
             had to live!
-- Oh, this is a good idea, 

Homer seems impervious to the punches, and continues his attempt to
reason with the angry fathers, who continue to beat on him.  "Hey!
Something's wrong with this guy!  He's not falling down!" whines
Kearney's dad.

Moe points a gun to them.

Fun's over, fellas!  If you're gonna beat up my friend in my bar,
there's a two-drink minimum.
-- Moe's most sacred rule, 

The men slowly back away out of Moe's.  Moe tends to Homer's injury.

  Moe: Geez, Homer.  I never seen a guy stand up to that kind of
       punishment. I mean, you took a three-man pounding and didn't even
       fall down.
Homer: Big deal.  I didn't even get my kid's belt back.  The only thing
       a loser like me is good for is taking beatings.
  Moe: There you go!  That's the spirit!  Homer, I've seen prizefighters
       couldn't take a punch half as good as you.  You know, boxing
       might be right up your alley.
Homer: Really?
  Moe: Oh please!  It's the good life, Homer.  Some of these boxers,
       they eat steak and lobster and salad bar all in a single
       meal.
Homer: [gasps]  Dressing...?
  Moe: Their choice.
-- 

Moe puts Homer to the test:

  Moe: Are you man enough to test every one of your limits?
Homer: Yes.
  Moe: And are you man enough to throw a punch should the opportunity
       arise?
Homer: Yes!
  Moe: And are you man enough to give me a sixty percent cut?
Homer: YES!
  Moe: I'll take it.
Homer: Woo-hoo!
        [a boxing bell rings]
-- Let the games begin, 

[End of Act One.  Time: 5:14]

As a manager, Moe wants Homer to have complete faith in him, and thus
leads him to...

Wow, I've never been in here before.
-- Homer steps into the ladies' room, 

Since there haven't been any ladies in Moe's since 1979, Moe turned
the ladies' room into an office replete with boxing gloves, a desk and
posters/pictures of Moe as a boxer.

Homer: You used to be a boxer just like me?
  Moe: Yup.  They called me Kid Gorgeous.  Later on, it was Kid
       Presentable. Then Kid Gruesome.  And finally, Kid Moe.
Homer: [raising dirty pail]  Hey, what's this?
  Moe: Ah, that, that's my old spit bucket.  Yeah, I've been meaning to
       empty that out.
-- 

Homer finds a picture of Moe standing beside a big black man in
glasses with odd, unbrushed hair standing up.

Homer: [gasps]  You know Lucius Sweet?!  He's one of the biggest names
       in boxing! He's exactly as rich and as famous as Don King, and he
       looks just like him, too!
  Moe: Yeah, he was my manager.  Back when I was Gorgeous, everybody
       wanted a piece of me.  But somehow, I just never made it to the
       big time.
Homer: Why not?
  Moe: 'Cause I got knocked out forty times in a row.  That, plus
       politics.  You know, it's all politics.
Homer: [glaring] Lousy democrats.
-- 

At home, at the breakfast table, the family discusses Homer's latest
hobby.

Homer, of all the crazy ideas you've had, this one ranks somewhere in
the middle.
-- Marge comments on Homer's new boxing carreer, 

Marge: Before you even consider this, I insist you consult a doctor.
Homer: No problemo.  [pecks Marge on the cheek and walks off]
Marge: A competant doctor!
Homer: [off-screen]  D'oh!
-- She knows the trick, 

Dr. Hibbert examines inside of Homer's left ear in the physicals room.

Hibbert: Well, sir, you more than meet every one of this state's
         requirements to box, wrestle or be shot out of a cannon.
  Marge: [growls]  That's what we get for living in a state founded by
         circus freaks.
-- At least he doesn't wrestle bears, 

Hibbert displays an x-ray of Homer's head.

Hibbert: You have an absolutely unique genetic condition known as "Homer
         Simpson syndrome".
  Homer: [moaning] Oh, why me?
-- 

Hibbert calms his fears: his brain is cushioned by a layer of fluid
1/8th of an inch thicker than normal, acting like a football helmet.

Hibbert: Why, I could wallop you all day with this surgical two-by-four
         without ever knocking you down.
          [brandishes stick, then checks his watch]
         But... I have other appointments.
-- To wallop people with Homer Simpson syndrome perhaps?,
      

Decked in boxing-trunks, Homer practices with Moe in an abandoned
ring.

Moe: All right, Homer.  Let's see the left.
      [a fly stops on Moe's right cushion]
      [Homer punches it, yet it flies away intact]
Moe: O-kay...  Let's see the right.
-- Don't hold your breath, 

Homer is exhausted on the ring boundry, panting.  "Just a second..."
"When you're ready."  "All right, I'm ready..." Homer begins to get
up, but falls back again.  "Wait a minute..."  Homer continues to
pant. "All right.  ...  Wait a minute, just a sec..."

  Moe: Okay, punching isn't your thing.  But that's okay.  You're not
       that kind of fighter.  What you're gonna do is stand there while
       your opponent gets exhausted from over-punching.
Homer: Then I can just push him over.
  Moe: That's right, and if the ref's not looking, you can kick him a
       couple of times.
-- Homer's always been master at dirty fighting, 

Moe rides a moped as Homer jogs in the street.

  Moe: Who's gonna knock you down?
Homer: No one!
  Moe: When do you gonna fight back?
Homer: Never!
  Moe: What are you gonna do?
Homer: Nothin'!
  Moe: That's my boy!
-- 

The fight is on at Moe's bar, and the crowd is waiting to see it.

Barney: Man, you'd never get me into a ring.  Boxing causes brain
        damage.
        [drinks varnish]
-- 

Meanwhile, Moe is psyching up Homer in his Ladies' Room office.

  Moe: Okay, you're fighting a guy named Boxcar Bob.
Homer: Brawled his way up from the boxcars, did he?
  Moe: Uh, no, not yet, he still lives at the trainyard.  But he's a
       hungry young fighter.  In fact, he's actually fighting for a
       sandwich.
-- The glory of boxing, 

Moe blows dust off of his boxing gloves and gives them to Homer.

  Moe: Homer, I want you to have my lucky mits.  I hope you do better
       with them than I did.
Homer: [donning them]  Gee, thanks, Moe.  What's this?
  Moe: Ah, that's the barbed wire.  We, uh, we called that the stinger.
       They, they don't let you use that no more.
-- But they did then?, 

Now, no matter how much he hits you, you don't do nothing, okay?  You
don't wanna get drawn into a boxing match, here.
-- Moe's idea of managing a boxer, 

Boxcar Bob discards his coat and travelling stick.  Homer takes twenty
one quick blows nonchalantly as the crowd cheers on.

Lenny: Man, that tramp's got the energy of a hobo.
 Carl: Yeah, he never stops punching -- except to check out his bindle.
        [Bob indeed checks it after every couple of punches]
-- 

As time passes, Bob becomes exhausted and can't hit anymore. Moe warns
Homer that this is the right time; he gently nudges his opponent, who
tips over, dead tired. The crowd cheers and Moe shares pride with
Homer.

November 3rd: Homer takes more blows by Boxcar Fred.  Homer is 7th
place in the semi-pro boxers chart.  Moe counts up more cash, which
Homer uses on premium wax.  Boxcar Ira is now taken out by Homer.
Homer has three more boxcar opponents taken out -- and three more
washes -- until he is moved up to first place.

Moe does business in his office and grabs a cigar from the "For your
courtesy" dispenser.  He ends up getting a light by a black man in a
tuxedo decorated with glittering, gaudy jewelry, donning bizzare,
sticking-up hair.  "Hello, Moe!  Delightful to see you again!"

   Moe: Lucius!  Hey!  What's a glitteradi like you doing in my dump?
        I thought you were managing the champ.
Lucius: Yes, managing Drederick has been my highest priority, even
        though he is temporarily incarcerated for pushing his mother
        down the stairs. But with his inpending release, I've been
        strategizing for his glorious return to the shores of Fistiana.
   Moe: Uh, what?
Lucius: His comeback fight.  You know, boxing?
-- 

Moe pities the man who will donate his body for Tatum's cause, but
drops his cigar when Lucious mentions Homer. Lucious only needs an
opponent that will last three rounds -- fans wanting to get drunk
before the fight is over -- but Moe doubts Homer could stand that
long. Nevertheless, the taste of glory and success is tempting...

That night, Homer and Moe are sat in lawnchairs atop the roof of Moe's
Tavern with two beers in hand.

  Moe: I gotta be honest with you, Homer.  I didn't bring you up here to
       show you my new tar paper.
Homer: You didn't?
  Moe: No.  Homer, how would you like to be heavyweight champion of the
       world?
Homer: Oh, sure.
-- Casual talk, 

  Moe: All you gotta do is fight Drederick Tatum.  It's this Saturday.
       Here's your parking pass.
Homer: [reading the pass]  Ooh, "general."
-- All the privileges, 

Homer doesn't have a clue about who Tatum is, but trusts Moe on that
point.

Not too far away, inside the Springfield Penitentiary, chaos and
anarchy is abound.  "Hey, come on guys, shut up," demands a large,
goteed black man eating brussels sprouts in his jail cell.  It's
Drederick.  In a heartbeat, the chaos ends, and guards step back as
prisoners return to their cells in silence.

[End of Act Two.  Time: 12:21]

Tatum's at a desk, with Lucius Sweet beside him.  Both are in front of
a mob of interviewers.

Man #1: Champ, do you feel remorse for your crime?
 Tatum: Oh, yes.  Believe me, my god, if I could turn back the clock on
        my mother's stair-pushing, I would certainly... reconsider it.
Man #2: Drederick, ah, what do you think of Homer Simpson?
 Tatum: I think he's a good man.  I like him.  I got nothing against
        him, but I'm definately gonna make orphans of his children.
Man #3: Uh, you know, they do have a mother, Champ.
 Tatum: Yes, but I would imagine that she would die of grief.
         [interviewers continue to battle to get their questions in]
Lucius: Thank you, thank you.  But the champ has no time for further
        queries.  This parole hearing is over.
         [audience/hearers groan]
Man #4: I wanted to know what it was like in prison...
-- The law meets the National Enquirer, 

Back at the family's breakfast table, Homer has some coffee while
Marge finds out about the fight reading the newspaper.

Marge: Homer, why are they saying you're going to fight Drederick Tatum?
Homer: [gulps]  Uh, well, uh, I was gonna surprise you, but... happy
       anniversary, baby!
-- 

Marge is upset, but Homer argues his point.

Homer: I'll make a fortune for one night's work!  We can have all the
       things we always dreamed of: a snooty butler, carpeted carports,
       those blue cupcakes they sell sometimes...
Marge: But you'll get killed!
Homer: Marge!  Will you let me finish?  Plug-In room deodorizers, front
       and rear spoilers for the car.
-- And just enough for the coffin, 

 Lisa: Mom's right, Dad.  The odds against you winning are a thousand to
       one.
Homer: Whoa, I don't think it's that unlikely.
 Lisa: Those are the odds they're giving in Vegas.
Homer: All right, I think we've heard just about enough from Mr.
       Newspaper today.  [tosses the newspaper outside]
-- 

Later that day, Bart and Grampa are watching an ad for Homer's match.

             [on TV, a monstrously strong Drederick Tatum exits a jail
             cell threateningly]
 Announcer: Society put away Drederick Tatum for his brutal crime.  But
            he's paid his debt, and now, he's going to get revenge... on
            Homer Simpson.
             [a shot of Homer, staring blankly, and getting powerfully
             punched in the face by Tatum's boxing glove; Homer's head
             explodes and morphs into the words "Tatum vs. Simpson:
             PAYBACK"]
Abe &amp; Bart: Yay!
      Bart: Woo hoo!
       Abe: [to Maggie] That's your daddy.
-- Correction: former daddy, 

The fight is now on at the Springfield Coliseum.  Lined up fans,
according to coliseum requirements, are dressed tackily.  Meanwhile, a
t-shirt peddler is about wearing one, and holding up a t-shirt with a
picture of a boxing glove headed for Homer's face.  "T-shirts!  Get
your t-shir-r-rts.  Tell 'em where you've been by wearing a t-shirt!"

Meanwhile, in the locker room, Bart is helping Homer prepare.

You'll be okay, Dad.  Just make sure he hits you an even number of
times, so you don't end up with amnesia.
-- Bart tips his father, 

Elsewhere, in the locker hall, Moe paces nervously in front of an
ashtray with several cigarette butts in them and scattered around the
tray on the floor. Moe butts out another cigarette then lights up
another.  Just then, Marge goes to see him.

Marge: Moe, I'm so glad I found you.  Please, promise me you won't let
       Homer get hurt.
  Moe: Hey, hey, hey, I'm not the villain here, okay?  If Homer gets
       killed in the ring tonight, it'll be because of your negative
       attitude -- there, I said it.
-- And let's not forget all those feminine undergarments...,
      

Marge doesn't fold in, and asks Moe to throw in his towel and stop the
fight the instant Homer is in danger; annoyed, Moe promises. However,
after Marge has left, he reconsiders and throws his towel in the trash
can.

Lights are everywhere in the arena, with the crowds full.  Ring
announcer Michael Buffer introduces the fight.

Buffer: Celebrities at ringside tonight:
        Star of the McBain action films, and feature player in the
        Hollywood prostitution scandal: Rainer-r-r Wolfcastle!
         [applause]
        TV anchorman and Springfield institution, Mr. Kent Brockman!
         [Kent waves, and the audience boos and throws litter at him]
  Kent: [sarcastic laugh]  This just in, go to hell!
Buffer: From the world of organized crime, say hello to Anthony "Fat
        Tony" D'Amico!
         [applause]
-- Typical ringside, 

The ruiner of events worldwide -- title fights, the Super Bowl, and the
Nixon funeral; ladies and gentlemen, the Fan Man!
-- Book him for your own funerals right now, 

The Fan Man, dressed in a red jumpsuit and helmet, parachutes into the
audience with a propeller on his back, which shaves off Krusty's
rightside of hair.  "Oh cripes!  Now I gotta comb this side over." he
complains.

Behind the doors of the walkway, Moe has a last chat with Homer.

      Moe: All right, Homer, I'm not gonna lie to you.  There's a good
           chance you can beat Tatum.  But you gotta visualize how
           you're gonna win, okay?
    Homer: Gotcha.
           [dreams on about his victory]
Announcer: A congenital heart defect has apparently felled Tatum moments
           before he could step into the ring.
-- You wish, Homer, 

Buffer introduces, "back into decent society", the heavyweight
Champion of the world, Drederick Tatum. The audience cheers as
Drederick Tatum, not fooling around, walks down the walkway with his
assistants as hip-hop rap music plays behind him.  Tatum enters the
boxing ring, prepares a little and shows off his "Mr. Armageddon"
robe.

To challenge the irresistable force of Tatum, we have the immoveable
object; he's been called the Brickhead House and is also known as the
Southern Dandy, Homer-r-r Simpson!
-- Who's gonna bleep me now?, 

Homer walks down the opposite runway with "Why Can't We Be Friends?"
as his theme song, with Abe and Moe on his side.  Homer has to be
pushed into the ring by Moe and Abe.  Lucius walks up to Moe.

Lucius: Your boy looks a little soft, Moe.  You do remember our
        arrangement?
   Moe: Yeah, don't worry, you'll get your three rounds.
Lucius: Stupendous.  Because if he goes down before that bell rings,
        your future's going with him.
   Moe: Okey-doke.  Future's down the crapper.  Gotcha.
-- What difference will it make?, 

Due to popular demand, we will forgo our national anthem.
-- Micheal Buffer starts the fight, 

The bell goes off and Tatum and Homer face each other.

Homer: Okay, Homer, nothing to be worried about.  Just... [gets punched]
       OOF!
        [way back in Row ZZ, Bart and Lisa watch]
 Bart: Wow!  I've never seen Dad hit somebody like that before!
 Lisa: What are you talking about?
 Bart: Isn't Dad the one in the black trunks?
 Lisa: No!
 Bart: Uh-oh.
Marge: [from behind the pillar with Maggie]  What?  What?  What am I
       missing?  What?
-- 

"And there's Tatum, showboating for the crowd!" says Michael Buffer as
Tatum pounds Homer silly.  Only six seconds have passed.  Moe tries to
motivate his champ.

Showing disdain towards Homer, Tatum takes a break to talk cooking
with Charlie Sheen. The referee directs Tatum back to the fight, and
he picks up where he left off beating on Homer.  A tall mass of curly
blue hair moves through the audience.  Homer's vision is clouded now.

Marge: [through Homer's fuzzy vision]  Homer!  Homer, he's not going to
       get tired.  You've got to hit him back.  Hit him back!
Homer: That cactus is right.
-- 

Homer realizes his only chance is to knock Tatum out. He winds up,
takes his best shot ever... and misses.  Tatum returns Homer's failed
punch and hits him directly in the head.  Homer's now on his last leg.

Moe: Hang in there, Homer!  Only four hundred and forty more seconds.
     [to Abe]  He's getting his second win.
Abe: No!  He's getting killed!
-- Bah, either way is good, 

Moe can't bear to watch, and runs away through the cheering crowd.

Krusty, Frink, Patty, Selma, Mr. Burns, Smithers, Lucius and Kent are
at the apex of excitement, helping the audience cheer on.

      Marge: Somebody stop the fight!  Where's the doctor?!
              [guess who's the fight doctor?]
Dr. Riviera: Kill him!  Kill him!
-- Where's that competent doctor when you need him?,
      

Tatum steps back and builds up what will be the final punch. Homer's
family watch, nervously, as Tatum swings his fist slowly towards
Homer. At the very last minute, Homer is picked up and rescued by Moe,
donning the Fanman's propeller.

Oh my god!  Simpson's manager has flown into the ring and is airlifting
him out!  Ladies and gentlemen, whatever dignity remained in boxing is
literally flying out the window.
-- 

Homer: [slurred] Are you an angel?
  Moe: Yes, Homer.  I'm an angel.  All us angels wear farah slacks.
Homer: But you stopped the fight.  Won't everyone be mad at you?
  Moe: Eh, let 'em be mad.  The only thing that matters to me is you're
       safe.
        [bumps Homer's head up a steel beam]
Homer: D'oh!
  Moe: Sorry.
-- Angelic goofs, 

Moe flies Homer out the ceiling window of the coliseum and lands him
outside to safety in front of a huge crowd.

 Tatum: Homer, your manager obviously loves you very much.
        Lucius, would you do that for me?
Lucius: Absolutely, I would.  [chuckles]  Now get in the van.
-- 

Tatum walks away.

Lucius: You couldn't even give me one lousy round, Moe.  You will always
        be a loser.  Now take your check for a hundred thousand dollars
        and get out of my sight.
   Moe: I don't need your stinking money!
         [carefully folds the check and puts it in his pocket]
-- 

The family gathers around Homer.

Marge: Oh, Homie!  Are you okay?
Homer: [in pain and sorrow] I can't remember where we parked.
Marge: That's all right.  We'll just wait till everyone else leaves.
 Bart: I got your tooth, Dad.
        [tries to fit it in his mouth]
Homer: Uh, not mine.
        [tosses tooth aside]
-- 

Moe pulls the cord that starts his propeller and flies away, going
"nowheres in particular", in need for time to think. An angry Fanman
chases him down on the ground, yelling at him for his equipment.

[End of Act Three.  Time: 22:19]

Credits roll over scenes of Moe saving an Indian woman and her baby
from a flood, pulling an explorer stuck in a tar pit, putting out
forest fires and giving CARE packages to third-world countries.
"People Who Need People" keeps playing up to the Gracie Films logo.

 EPISODE TITLE: Burns, Baby Burns


EPISODE SUMMARY:   {ol}

The family parks up to a tree-surrounded cider mill cabin.  While
autumn leaves fall, the family enters the mill.

 Lisa: What a perfect outing for a beautiful autumn day.
Marge: I feel sorry for everyone who's cooped up inside watching the
       seventh game of the World Series.
Homer: [mocking] Yeah, they won't learn anything about apples today.
-- Their loss, I guess, 

The mill tour guide is explaining the history of the mill to the
visitors.

Ranger: ... and the cider mill operated continuously until 1941, when
        its workers left to fight in the second World War.  When they
        returned, the old girl was just as they'd left her, only now she
        was infested with thousands, upon thousands of rats.
         [Everyone "Eww"s and "Yuck"s]
Ranger: Right. And if you listen real carefully, you can still hear them
        gnawing away at the apples and splashing around in the toilets.
        And that concludes this portion of the tour.
        [eagerly extends a tip can]
-- 

The visitors and the family are in the apple compressing room.  While
the tour guide continues to explain the history of the mill, Homer
becomes unbearably bored and sneaks away from everyone else and runs
into the Flanderses, coming out the gift shops with giant apple-hats
on.

  Ned: Well, if God didn't make little green apples, it's Homer Simpson!
       How long have you been here?
Homer: Twenty of the suckiest minutes of my life.
  Ned: Ho ho ho, suckin' down the cider, uh?  Hey, word to the wise --
       [shows Homer a card] season pass!  It pays for itself after the
       sixteenth visit.  You know, most people don't know the difference
       between apple cider  and apple juice, but I do. Now here's a
       little trick to help you remember.  If it's clear and yella',
       you've got juice there, fella!  If it's tangy and brown, you're
       in cider town.  Now, there's two exceptions and it gets kinda
       tricky here...
        [Homer's brain gets bored]
Brain: [moans]  You can stay, but I'm leaving.
        [brain floats away; Homer is now staring blankly]
  Ned: ... can be yellow, if they're using late season apples. And, of
       course, in Canada, the whole thing's flip-flopped.
        [Homer collapses]
  Ned: Oh, my!  I'd better get you some cider.
-- Old-cider Ned, 

Marge is wearing an apple-hat while walking through the autumn-leaf
trees, holding Maggie with Lisa.

Marge: Next to Spring and Winter, Fall is my absolute favorite season.
       Just look at all this beautiful foilage.
 Lisa: It's not "foilage," mom, it's "foliage."  Foo-liage.
Marge: That's what I said, foilage.  It doesn't take a nucular scientist
       to pronounce foilage.
 Lisa: [growls]
-- Does Homer qualify?, 

A leaf blows as we're slowly taken to the train station at a country
club in New Haven, Connecticut.  Smithers is carrying fur coat-wearing
Mr. Burns' bags while they both head for a traincar.

   Burns: Honestly, Smithers, I don't know why Harvard even bothers to
          show up.  They barely even won.
Smithers: Their cheating was even more rampant than last year, sir.
-- 

Smithers opens the door to a plush, luxurious traincar, privately
belonging to Mr. Burns.

Burns: Well, I say let Harvard have its football and academics. Yale
       will always be first in gentlemanly club life.  Why, every friend
       I have, I've made right here.
        [an old Yalie walks up to Mr. Burns' car window]
 Dink: Hello, Burnsie!  It's your old roomie, Dink!
Burns: [groans]  [pulls down the window shade]
-- 

The train speeds on, while Mr. Burns enjoys a nice game of pool.
Smithers racks up the balls for Burns while he sharpens his stick.
Mr. Burns readies to make his shot.  "Steady.  Steady-y."  The balls
are wobbling all across the table when the train hits a halt and rocks
Burns' car.  Smithers falls over Mr. Burns, and all of the balls
tumble into the right cornerpocket.  "Oh-ho, nicely played, sir!"
congratulates Smithers.

The delay is caused by a discarded couch on the tracks.

   Burns: Oh this might take a while, Smithers.  Why don't you get drunk
          and stumble around comically for my amusement?
Smithers: [taking bottle of booze]  I'll be a one-man conga line.
-- There's nothing he won't do for Mr. Burns, 

A souvenirs shop is on the other side of the road.  The man inside has
fallen asleep with his hand on his face.  His hand slides off and he
bumps his head, awakening himself to find a delayed train.
"Customers!" he rejoices; "Thank god!  Papa needs a new pair of
everything."

The man (which we'll later know as Larry) grabs an armful of stuff and
runs up to the train.  He knocks on some car windows trying to hock
stuff to seemingly annoyed passengers.

Hey, how're ya doing?  Welcome to Scenic Waynesport, and remember your
visit with a googly-eyed walnut.  [holds up walnut toy]
How about a googly-eyed rock?
Some nice local squash candy?
A stretched-out Pepsi bottle?  [holds up a weirdly-shaped Pepsi bottle]
Come on.  If this stuff is too nice for ya, I've got some crap!
-- Larry tries to sell some quality-impaired souvenirs,
      

Smithers is thoroughly drunk and is stumbling about Mr. Burns'
traincar while Burns claps in delight.  Larry approaches the window,
and suddenly begins to gawk with his mouth wide open.  Just then, the
train starts up again. Larry runs beside the train, staring at Mr.
Burns when he discards his loot and rummages through his wallet and
gets an old picture of young Mr. Burns.  He looks at it, and then
looks at Mr. Burns in the train.

    Larry: [running]  Hey, Casey Jones, where's this train headed?
Conductor: Springfield.
    Larry: Yeah, yeah. What state?
            [the reply is muffled by the whistle]
-- Ahh, some of life's greatest mysteries, 

It's night, and the family has concluded its visit to the cider mill.
Their speeding car blows away some autumn leaves.

Marge: I can honestly say that was the most fun I've ever had.  The
       mill, the history, all that gorgeous... foliage.
        [Lisa smiles]
       I can't excape Lisa, our little walking libary.
        [Lisa makes a desperated look]
-- Better give up and bet on Maggie, 

Larry, holding a "Springfield" sign while standing next to luggage,
sees the family drive by and looks up with hope.

Can't they get a pole for that sign?
-- Homer seeing a hitchhiker, 

Bart clarifies the concept for him.

Homer: Ooh!  Let's pick him up!
Marge: No!  What if he's crazy?
Homer: And what if he's not?  Then we'd look like idiots.
Marge: We're not picking him up.
Homer: Oh, yes, we are.
Marge: There's not enough room.
Homer: Yes, there is...
        [time passes]
Marge: I just don't think it's a good idea.
Homer: And I think it's the best idea I've ever had.  We're picking up the
       weirdo, and that's final.
        [pulls back from their driveway]
-- Never heard of too little, too late, eh Homer?  

They're back on the road, and so is Larry.  They stop for him and he
walks up to Homer's window.

Hey, you folks are all right.  Man, it was rough getting a ride out
there.  The only car that stopped was a hearse that thought I fell out.
It was rough, I tell ya.
-- OFF picks up Larry, 

Larry lets himself in, crowding things a bit in the backseat for
Grampa, Lisa and Bart.

Marge: Careful of the apple pie on the seat.
  Abe: Uh-oh!
Marge: Grampa, are you sitting on the pie?
  Abe: I sure hope so.
-- 

The family drives on.

Larry: Hey, I'm looking for this guy.  [shows an old picture of Burns]
       Anyone know who he is?
 Bart: Yeah, sure, we know him.  That's Mr. Burns.
 Lisa: He tried to kill our puppies.
Marge: He sexually harassed me.
  Abe: He stole my fiancee.
Homer: He made fun of my weight.
        [pause]
Larry: Okay, so there's been a little friction.  Know his address?
-- 

The family drops Larry off at the Burns Manor and drives off.  The
gates are open and Larry lets himself in.

Ho, this guy's got more bread than a prison meat loaf.  He's rich, I
tell ya.  I never seen a place with a walk-in mailbox. [realizing] Hey,
who am I talking to?
-- Larry comments on Burns' mansion, 

Larry rings the doorbell.  Smithers answers.

Smithers: [eyeing Larry]  Yes?
   Larry: [sweating]  Yeah, uh... Hi, my-my name is Larry.  I'm here to
          see Mr. Burns.
Smithers: Well, I hate to break it to you, Larry, but if Mr. Burns
          ever wants to see a stranger, he will observe him through a
          powerful telescope.
-- Hasn't lost the common touch, 

Mr. Burns opens the door, asking Smithers what's going on.  He sees
the visitor and scolds him for interrupting his Lime Rickey.  He takes
a finishing sip of his drink and asks the man to state his business.

Larry: Well, uh... sheesh... uh... I'm a little nervous here. What I'm
       trying to say is, I'm...
Burns: You're what?  Selling light bulbs?  Worried about the whales?
       Keen on Jesus?  Out with it!
Larry: Well, Mr. Burns, I'm your son.
        [Burns is shocked]
Larry: Oh, and I stepped on one of your peacocks.  You got a paper
       towel?
-- 

[End of Act One.  Time: 6:22]

Mr. Burns looks underneath Larry's toupee and sees three circles on
his head just like the ones on his. This cannot lie.

Larry: Ah, Pop, don't get me wrong; it's great to be here.  But how's a
       guy like you wind up with a son like me?
Burns: Ah, Larry, my lad, I've gone over this story in my mind a
       million times.  It was 1941, the... No, '39...
-- Two million times wouldn't have hurt, 

Burns flashes back to the outdoors of the 25th Yale reunion feast of
his Class of 1914.  A much younger C.M. Burns sees his unrequited love
of his college years, Mimsy Bancroft, a middle-aged woman staring back
at Young Burns.  Young Burns becomes wide-eyed as the narration goes
on. "Of course, by then, Mimsy had her share of wrinkles and a grey
hair or two, but my adoring eye saw past those minor imperfections --
to her 21-year-old daughter, Lily," a much younger, dainty blonde
standing in a pink dress with her hand on her hip.

I took Lily to the local cinematorium, where our passions were inflamed
by Clark Gable's reckless use of the word "Damn".
 [Young Burns and Lily leave the theater, Burns covered in kisses]
We sneaked into the nearby Peabody Museum. There, under the smiling eyes
of four stuffed Eskimos, we expressed our love physically, as was the
style at the time.
 [a janitor inside the eskimo exhibit watches the two make love on the
 floor with glee]
-- Burns narrates love at the time, 

Larry: Well, how do ya like that?  I have been in a museum.  So, what
       happened with you and Ma?
Burns: Oh, there was a terrible scandal.  Lily's family forced her to
       give you up, and bundled her off to a convent in the South Seas.
       I never heard from her again.  But I prattle on.  Tell me
       everything about your life.
Larry: Oh, what's to tell?  I was at the orphanage till I was 18, then I
       got my job at a souvenir stand.  Oh, and once I saw a blimp.
-- Uh-huh, 

Mr. Burns shows Larry his luxurious suite of a room.  Larry is very
impressed, and smothers Burns with gratitude.  Burns nicely fights him
off, and shows him to the playroom, in case he ever gets bored.  On
the other side of the playroom door is a play in progress.

Actor: ...you can't just eat the orange and throw the peel away!  A
       man's not a piece of fruit!
Burns: This show was supposed to close last week!  Close this show!
       Close it, I say!
        [Burns slams the door shut]
        [Larry comes back]
Larry: Hey, don't worry about it.  You're all right.
-- He probably saw the play as cartoon strips, 

Homer is sleeping on his post at the SNPP when he awakens to stretch
and finds Larry in a chair behind him.  Both are startled, and Homer
panics when he learns he's talking to the boss' son, cleaning his
panel from an unfinished jigsaw puzzle and turning on sector 7-G.

Larry: Ah, relax.  I don't wanna work.  I'm so lazy, I took lessons on a
       player piano.
Homer: Wow, that's really lazy.
Larry: Lazy?  You're not kiddin'.  Why, I'm like a rug on Valium, I'm
       talkin' lazy.
Homer: Soo lazy.
        [later, eating with his family]
Homer: ...and Larry and I have so much in common, Marge, way more than
       you and me.  If I could be stranded on an island with anyone,
       it would definitely be Larry.
-- But I still prefer you for snuggling, 

Marge: [bored] I think we've heard enough about Larry Burns for one
       evening.
Homer: Why?  It's not like anything interesting happened to anyone else
       today.
        [pan to the kids]
        [Bart is examining a diamond]
        [Lisa's left arm is in a cast]
        [Maggie is wearing a "Cutest Baby" contest sash]
-- Three future episodes, maybe?, 

At the Springfield Glen Country Club, Mr. Burns is preparing Larry to
meet some high-class minglers at a dinner party. The first victim is
Admiral Carstairs, an elderly man in a metal-laced admiral uniform.

Hey, Skipper, [slaps him in the back] good to meet ya.  Hoo, where'd you
start out, on the Merrimack?  Hey, I should talk.  I hope I look that
good when I'm 200.
-- Larry's charms at work, 

Carstairs is not amused, and Larry is pulled aside by Mr. Burns, who
notes to him that Carstairs is very sensitive about his age.  Just
then, a distinguished, elderly woman wearing a tiara approaches Larry
and Burns.

Woman: Oh, Monty, this must be the son I've heard so much about.  Larry,
       you must meet our daughter, the debutante.
       [reveals a short, chunky girl in glasses with a huge nose]
       She came out last spring.
Larry: Whoa!  Put her back in!  She's not done yet!
Woman: [through her glasses] Hmmph!
-- Tactless, yet rude, 

Mr. Burns and Smithers are getting some food from the banquet table
and discuss Larry.  Burns is starting to notice Larry is an unusual
character and Smithers says he's rough around the edges.  Just then,
Larry is seen on the other end of the serving table in a bib eating
out of the shrimp pyramid.  "Pull up a seat, Pop.  You too, Chuckles.
I mean, the food ain't great, but the portions are terrific."  An
angry chef approaches Larry, glaring.  "Hey, I'm kiddin', relax. Hey,
give my regards to Mrs. Boyardee."  Burns is disappointed in Larry's
lack of refinement and sends for "the boys at Yale admissions."

In Burns' office, a man and woman from Yale Admission go to Mr. Burns'
desk to discuss Larry.

Burns: Well, did you meet Larry?
  Man: Oh, yes.  He made light of my weight problem, then suggested my
       motto be "semper fudge."  At that point, he told me to [making
       quotes with fingers] relax.
Burns: How were his test scores?
Woman: Let's just say this: he spelled "Yale" with a six.
-- Y0u mu5t 6e k1dd1ng!, 

Burns: I see.  Well, I -- ooh, you know, I just remembered, it's time
       for my annual donation.  [brings out checkbook and pen]  I wonder
       how much I should give.
  Man: Well, frankly, test scores like Larry's would call for a very
       generous contribution. [opens book] For example, a score of 400
       would require a donation of new football uniforms, 300, a new
       dormitory, and in Larry's case, we would need an international
       airport.
Woman: Yale could use an international airport, Mr. Burns.
-- Then maybe a stock exchange market, 

Burns gets ticked off: "Are you mad?  I'm not made of airports!"  He
sends them off, and orders Smithers to summon Larry.  Smithers looks
at the monitor screen of Sector 7-G and only finds a sign in Larry's
chair reading "Gone Drinkin'"  Mr. Burns is furious.

Homer and Larry are hanging out with the barflies at Moe's.

 Larry: Everybody go nuts! I'm buying!
        [to Moe]  Hey, Handsome, send the bill to my dad.
   Moe: Okay, but the last guy who charged a drink to Burns turned up in
        a landfill.
Barnet: [covered with garbage]  Yeah, but it was worth it.  [belches out
        a fish skeleton]
-- Already exhausted your life supply?, 

Larry doesn't understand why everyone in town is against his dad,
which he compares to a pussycat. To prove his point, he invites Homer
over.

An awkward silence overshadows the long dining room table where Mr.
Burns, Homer and Larry are all having dinner.  Homer is making a pig
of himself despite the silence, broken by Larry. He asks his dad to
make an effort and "make with the yakkety-yak-yak."

Burns: You, Foodbag.  Do you have a son?
Homer: Yes, sir, I do.
Burns: And is he a constant disappointment?  Does he bring home nitwits
       and make you talk to them?
Homer: Oh, all the time!  Have you ever heard of this kid Milhouse?
       He's a little wiener...
Burns: Fascinating.  Good night.
-- Milhouse? Fascinating?, 

Larry: Dad, what's with you tonight?  I mean, I'm getting frostbite over
       here.
Burns: I'll tell you what's with me!  The humiliation of having a
       coarse, boorish ignoramus for a son!
Homer: [quietly]  Uh, I should go.
        [gets up slowly from his chair, about to go]
        [returns to the table, pigs up more food for the way home]
-- Keep fighting, I'll keep eating, 

Larry questions his father's love, but Burns slams the door without
answering.  Homer walks over to Larry to comfort him, while feeding
off of a chicken leg.

A rejected Larry walks out of Mr. Burns' house with Homer (still
eating his chicken leg).

Larry: Sheesh, Dad and I, we started out great.  But now it's falling
       apart like a Chinese motorcycle.
Homer: It's so unfair.  You're everything a dad could hope for.
Larry: Yeah, I tell ya, I don't get no regard.  No regard at all.  No
       esteem, either.
-- Larry Dangerfield, 

Homer: Larry, there's only one sure way to make him realize how much he
       loves you.  And that is a phony kidnapping.
Larry: Yeah, right.  I don't know.  Maybe I should just leave town.
Homer: [singing persuasively]  Phony kidnapping...
Larry: Nah... I know what I gotta do.  I gotta clean up my act.  No more
       joking around all the time.  No more slacking off at work.  And
       most important, no more booze!  [throws down glass of alcohol]  I
       know I can do it.
        [later...]
Burns: [reading a letter] "Your son has been kidnapped."
-- Well, almost, 

[End of Act Two.  Time: 13:41]

Police officers are busily searching for prints in Mr. Burns' office.
Mr. Burns can't believe someone's kidnapped Larry, and won't rest
until he's returned.  Smithers notes that as recently as two hours ago
Mr. Burns wanted him out of his life, but it's the principle of the
matter to Mr. Burns, who won't stomach being stolen from--whether it
be a Sunday newspaper or Larry.

Wiggum: All right, Mr. B.  When the kidnappers call with the ransom
        demand, you tell them you'll leave the money under the big net
        in the park.
   Lou: And then down comes the net, right, Chief?
Wiggum: Heyyy, I like it!  I like it a lot!
-- 

At home, Marge sees the couch missing from the TV room, replaced by a
mess of wires.  She grunts when she sees the wiring join other wires,
all leading to the basement. She continues to follow the lead, up to
finds Homer, Bart and Lisa watching TV with Larry inside the basement.

Marge: What are you doing in the basement?  It's like you're hiding out
       down here.
Homer: Hiding out??  Pfft.  Marge, you've been reading too many hideout
       books.
Marge: And what's that hitchhiker doing here?  Is every drifter we meet
       going to move in with us?
Homer: Of course not.  We'll decide that on a drifter-by-drifter basis.
-- Practical Homer, 

Lisa introduces her to Larry.

 Bart: He's great at pointing out everyone's foibles.
Larry: Hey, how're ya doing.  Ooh!  Look at your hair!  What happened?
       You saw yourself in the mirror?
 Bart: He's kiddin', Mom.  But seriously, I'd love to have hair like
       yours.  I just can't get the zoning permits.
 Lisa: Hey, that reminds me, Mom; Buckingham Palace called.  They want
       their hat back.
        [Marge growls]
Larry: Hey kids, how about a hand for your Mom?  She's all right.
        [everyone applauds and cheers for Marge]
Marge: [more shy than annoyed]  Oh, yeah, thank you.
-- Open mike night at the Simpsons, 

Mr. Burns and Smithers are at the police station, where Wiggum scarfs
down doughnuts while his band of officers work on tracking down
information on tracking maps.  The phone rings.  Mr. Burns answers.

Burns: Ahoy-hoy?
Homer: [speaking through a kazoo]  Hello, Mr. Burns.  This is the
       kidnapper.  Do you miss your son?
Burns: Yes, I'm missing one son.  Return it immediately!
Homer: If you really love Larry, prove it, and you can have him back
       today.
Burns: Oh, how much proof do you need?  5,000?  6,000?  I swear, that's
       all I've got.
Homer: Don't you care about your son?  This is more important than
       money.
Burns: More important than money?  Who is this?
Homer: Uh...  [panics, loses control of the phone]  Just a second.
       [hangs up]
-- Still better than giving out your name, 

Wiggum: Beautiful.  Eddie, did you trace the phone number?
 Eddie: Sure did, Chief.
Wiggum: [reading paper] 5-5-5... Aw, geez, that's gotta be phony.
        [discards the number into a fire]
-- 

Everyone's still in the basement.  Bart, Lisa, Homer and Larry play
cards.

Lisa: Hey, I think I got a Pai Gow.
Bart: [groans]  I hate Pai Gow.  Can't we just play Quang Jong?
-- Those games they play, 

Marge becomes impatient and wants to go back upstairs, but Homer
hastily objects.  On TV, Kent Brockman, saddled in a newschopper,
reports that Mr. Burns' son has been kidnapped.  Marge is shocked, and
doesn't approve more when she learns it's a hoax.

Marge: I want you to take Larry back to Mr. Burns right now, before you
       get in a lot of trouble.
Homer: But the.. wh.. Marge!  It's broad daylight and there's cops
       everywhere!
Marge: No excuses.  Just do it.
        [Homer reluctantly obeys and takes Larry upstairs]
        [they walk out the house, to be spotted by Kent's air newsteam]
 Kent: Of course, we'll bring you updates just as soon as they...  Oh!
       Wait a minute!  There they are!
        [Homer shreaks and both he and Larry break for Homer's car and
        drive off]
 Kent: Appearing in broad daylight with police everywhere, ladies and
       gentlemen, there's only one word for that: idiocy.
Marge: [groans]
-- Still not tired of being wrong all the time?, 

Homer recklessly drives Larry and himself to a hiding place.  They
drive through a narrow alley, throwing off the police.  Homer and
Larry get out and try to climb the fence.  Hanging onto it, the fence
breaks forward and slams into the ground.

Larry: We've gotta find someplace to hide.
Homer: [gasps]  The abandoned warehouse!
        [they enter a dilapidated warehouse]
        [inside, people are busily working]
Homer: D'oh!  Stupid economic recovery!
-- 

The next resort is a local costume shop.  Moments later, two men
dressed in a gorilla and organ-grinder costume exit the shop.  The
owner of the store catches Homer and Larry sitting fearfully inside
the bathroom, and orders them out.

Running out of options, Homer declares that they need to find a place
that no one would ever go to.  Instantaneously, Homer spots a movie
theater playing "Too Many Grandmas," starring Olympia Dukakis and Bo
Derek.

Bo Derek: [v.o.] Drive faster, Grandma!  Grandma's gaining on us!
-- Homer and Larry watch "Too Many Grandmas," 

  Homer: [chuckles]  They'll never look for us here.
  Larry: Yeah.  This place is emptier than a Scottish pay toilet.
Moleman: [behind them]  Shh!  Some people are trying to watch the movie.
  Homer: You don't like it, call the cops.  [throws popcorn at him]
-- Professional hiding-out, 

Moleman excuses himself out of the auditorium. Soon enough, police
cars surround the theater, with one carrying Mr. Burns and Smithers.
Kent Brockman does a news report.

This is Kent Brockman, live from the Aztec theater, where police have
learned that kidnapper Homer Simpson and hostage Larry Burns are inside,
talking loudly.
-- 

Worried Marge and Bart and Lisa watch the news coverage.

Marge: Oh, give yourself up, Homie!
 Bart: No, Dad!  Shoot your way out!
Marge: [grunts at Bart]
        [On TV, Homer barges through some doors in the theater, and is
        shot quite graphically through various parts of the body.]
  All: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!
 Kent: A bloody end for Homer Simpson... is just one of several possible
       outcomes according to our computer simulation.  Now, here's how
       it would look if the police killed him with a barrage of
       baseballs.
 Lisa: We've gotta go down there and help Dad!
        [they walk out]
        [Only heard on TV, Homer is pelted with a barrage of baseballs]
Homer: Ouch!  Oooch!  Eeech!  Ouch!  Oooch!  [whining] Oh, stop it!
-- More delightful excerpts from the minds of Channel 6 news,
      

Wiggum, Lou and Eddie prepare to move in for the kill and succeed in
making noise merely by walking down the sticky, noisy floor of the
auditorium screening Too Many Grandmas.  Wiggum spots a bag of popcorn
and eats a little of it.  "Still warm.  They can't be far."  "Chief!"
calls out Lou, pointing to the exit next to the balcony seat, where
Homer is found scaling an escape ladder.  The cops run after him,
making more noisy sounds from running on the sticky floor.

Homer and Larry run across the Aztec neon sign and see below them the
swarm of police cars.  A projector is directed towards them.

Wiggum: Don't be a fool, Simpson!  Let the kid go!
 Burns: [through amplifier] The negotiations have failed.  Shoot him!
-- Hostage negociation subliminal tapes at work, 

Wiggum takes the safety off the gun and prepares to shoot when Larry
stands in the way of Homer. He explains everything, much to the stupor
of the gathering crowd.

   Burns: I should've known you were the only one stupid enough to
          kidnap you!  Now get down here so I can spank you in front of
          this gawking rabble.
          [away from amplifier]  Smithers, take off my belt.
Smithers: [giddily]  With pleasure, sir!
-- Don't give out too much clues, now, 

Homer intervenes.

Homer: Maybe we did fake a kidnapping, but is that really such a crime?
       All your son wanted was a little attention, a little love.  I'm a
       father myself, sir.  And sure, sometimes my kids can be obnoxious
       [Bart glares], or boring [Lisa glares], or stinky [Maggie
       glares], but they can always count on one thing: their father's
       unconditional love.
-- Lover of all obnoxious boring stinky creatures on Earth,
      
   
Homer and Larry are taken down by the crane of a fire truck. Homer
hugs his wife and kids.

Larry: Well, how 'bout it, Pop?  I know it's tough, but can you love me
       for what I am?  [cops a smirk]
Burns: Uh... well... uh... [hugs Larry]  There there, sonny boy. I
       suppose I have been a bit... Oh, no, I can't do it.  It's just
       not me.  I'm sorry, Larry.  I can't be the family that you need.
Larry: Aw, that's okay.  I got a wife and kids.  Oh, that reminds me.
       They're probably wondering where I went.  I told 'em I'm going
       for coffee.  That was a week ago.
-- 

Burns: Well, son, delighted to have met you.  It's good to know that...
       there's another kidney out there for me.
Larry: You got it, Pop.  Just let me run a few pints through it first.
-- 

Larry is given a margarita, and invites everyone to party. The entire
crowd cheers, and Journey's "Any Way You Want It" starts playing
loudly as everyone starts dancing while drinking a lot of liquor.

 Lisa: Who's playing that music?
Marge: And where's all that liquor coming from?
Homer: It's a party, Marge.  Doesn't have to make sense.
        [a Hawaiian lei falls from out of the sky onto Homer's neck]
        [Homer's handed a drink]
Homer: Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo!  Oh, yeah!
-- 

Everyone's partying the night away, dancing on top of cars and dancing
the story away as the song plays out through the credits.

[End of Act Three.  Time: 21:24]

 EPISODE TITLE: Bart After Dark


EPISODE SUMMARY:   {dga}

At the Simpson household, Bart and Lisa are watching "Itchy &amp;
Scratchy" when suddenly the screen goes blank.

         TV: ... and fight and fight and fight...
              [screen goes blank]
Bart &amp; Lisa: [screaming] Dad!  V-chip, v-chip!
      Homer: Sorry, sorry, my fault.
-- Is "Itchy &amp; Scratchy" TV-14?  

Homer resumes the show, which is "Good Cats - Bad Choices". The
setting is a talk show, and Scratchy is the guest. "Says mouse friend
mistreats him" reads the caption. Backstage, Itchy "feels he is the
victim", and goes on-stage with a broken bottle. Scratchy "doesn't
know slashing is imminent", but panics when reading this last caption.
His nemesis joins him -- applause from the audience -- raises the
bottle, and...

Announcer: We interrupt this cartoon for a special report.
    Homer: [gasps] Someone found my keys!
-- Prioritizing the news, 

Brockman: Kent Brockman at the Action News desk.  A massive tanker has
          run aground on the central coastline, spilling millions of
          gallons of oil on Baby Seal Beach.
    Lisa: [gasps] Oh, no!
   Homer: It'll be okay, honey.  There's lots more oil where that came
          from.
-- Environmentalist at heart, 

Brockman reports that apparently the captain was drunk at the helm.
And the captain, it turns out, is none other than Captain McAllister,
barely standing on his feet. He offers 100 bucks to Dave Shutton for
taking the blame -- aloud and on camera, of course.

Brockman: A clean-up effort is already underway, and as always, the
          first to pitch in are those unsung heroes, Hollywood movie
          stars.
           [cut to Baby Seal Beach, where Rainier Wolfcastle is cleaning
           off a baby seal]
 Rainier: This isn't about publicity.  This is about cleaning off gunk.
 Starlet: [holding a bird egg]  As a Golden Globe nominee, I just think
          it's our duty to make the real globe a little more golden.
           [egg hatches]
-- Steering clear of more fashionable causes, 

Lisa is touched, and tries to talk her mother into driving up there.

 Lisa: We'd be doing our part for the environment!  Plus, we'd get to
       clean up all those cute animals.
Marge: Honey, we don't need to drive 400 miles to clean animals.  You
       can stay right here and give the dog a bath.  Or trim the cat's
       nails.
       [Snowball II walks by on nails that raise her several inches off
       the ground]
-- 

 Lisa: Oh, Mom, please?  You can make this my birthday and Christmas
       presents.
Marge: You already used up your birthday and Christmas presents on that 
       peach tree we got you.  And you hardly ever play with that
       anymore.
 Lisa: Yes, I do.  Sure, I do.  Look!
       [runs out and frolics unconvincingly by the tree]
       [singing] Here I am playing on my peach tree, Mom.
Marge: [fed up] Oh, all right, we'll go.
-- 

Marge packs up the car and briefs Homer.

Marge: Now the cat needs his medication...
Homer: [assenting, simultaneously] No problem...
Marge: ... every morning and the furnace has been putting off...
Homer: Can do.  Right.  Uh-huh.
Marge: ... a lot of carbon monoxide, so keep the window open.
Homer: Gotcha.  Cat in the furnace.
Marge: Ah, you know, I think we'll take Maggie with us.
-- Wise decision, 

And if anything happens, just use your best judgemmmm... just do what I
would do.
-- Marge and the dangers of leaving Homer alone, 

The girls drive off, and the boys wave to them. Not that they'll miss
them too much, though.

Homer: A whole week of just father and son.  See you at dinner.
        [both walk off whistling]
 Bart: What time?
Homer: You know?  I don't know.
 Bart: Shall we say... ten?
Homer: All right, just wake me up.
-- 

Later that night, Bart and Homer stuff their faces while watching TV.

    Homer: [mouth full of food] You know, Bart, I saw this one.
     Bart: [mumbles incoherently]
Announcer: Live, from the Grand Ballroom of the Hapsburg Imperial
           Palace, it's the World Series of Bumper Cars.
-- Homer and Bart "batching" it, 

 Bart: Dad, do I have to brush my teeth?
Homer: No, but at least rinse your mouth out with soda.
        [Bart opens a can and gargles with it]
-- Only three cavities?  Best checkup ever!  

At Baby Seal Beach, the girls have reached their oily destination.

  Lisa: [enthusiastic] I'm gonna rescue a baby seal, and then I'm gonna
        save an otter!
   Man: Whoa, whoa, whoa, I'm sorry, but all the animals have already
        been reserved for celebrities.
         [Rainer Wolfcastle carries up a huge sack]
Rainer: There.  That's 104 pounds of sandpipers.
  Lisa: You mean there's nothing left to clean?
   Man: Well, there are rocks.  Thousands and thousands of rocks.
        [smiles]
         [later that day, Marge and Lisa are scrubbing rocks]
 Marge: I've got rocks that need washing at home
-- This is not as fun as I had anticipated, 

Seems Baby Seal Beach is not the only place in need of cleaning, as
Homer throws a beer can into the dumpster which the floor has become.

Homer: Geez, look at this place.  We gotta do something.
 Bart: Hmm.  Garbage angels?
        [they throw themselves from the sofa and make garbage angels,
        laughing]
-- Family quality clean-up time, 

Later, Bart feels sluggish (stupid Carbon Monoxide).

 Bart: Dad?  I think I need some fresh air.  Can I go to the park?
Homer: Do I have to sit up?
 Bart: No.
Homer: Knock yourself out.
-- 

At the Springfield Park, Milhouse is showing his RC plane flight
skills to Bart and Nelson, as they watch the plane come and go, and
come, and go...

    Bart: Milhouse, this is boring.  Make it crash or something.
Milhouse: [smugly] Perfectly level flying is the supreme challenge of
          the scale model pilot.
-- Milhouse the RC nerd, 

Nelson takes the remote and gives a more spectacular stunt. The plane
loops and wanders everywhere, until it targets a paddleboat occupied
by Martin and Ralph.

Martin: Ah!  It's gaining on us!
 Ralph: I'm pedaling backwards!
-- Ralph the Viking, 

Monty Burns also has a close encounter with the plane...

I don't like being outdoors, Smithers.  For one thing, there are too
many fat children.
-- Monty Burns, 

The plane bounces off Smithers' head, and finally ends its trip
crashing on the roof of a mysterious old house. The fence says "no
trespassing".

Milhouse: Thanks a lot.  Now it's stuck on that haunted house.
  Nelson: I heard a witch lives there.
   Ralph: I heard a Frankenstein lives there.
Milhouse: You guys are way off.  It's a secret lab where they take the 
          brains out of zombies and put them in the heads of other
          zombies to create a race of super-zombies.
  Nelson: That's the house?!
-- Are reverse vampires involved?  

Bart isn't impressed, and rings. The reply on the intercom is clear
enough: "Go away. No children." But it'll take more than that to stop
Bart, who climbs in a tree, then jumps on the roof. He grabs the
plane, showing off.

S-U-C-C-E-E-S!  That's the way you spell succe...
-- Bart follows the steps of his S-M-R-T father, 

But he slips and slides down the roof, bumping into a gargoyle which
crashed to the ground. He hangs onto a rain gutter for dear life, when
comes... oh, no! It's a caterpillar! It steps on Bart's fingers one by
one, and the tickling makes him slowly lose his grip.

[lauging]  No, no.  H-help, h-help.  I'm gonna die.
-- Bart, very perceptive, 

Bart survives his fall to the ground, but has brought the attention of
the lady of the house. The look, the dress, the floating cape and the
lighting give the perfect impression of a witch. She grabs him by the
ear.

Milhouse: Oh, no!  The witch has Bart!
  Martin: We've got to hurry!
           [The boys run off screaming in terror.]
-- A good solution to any crisis, 

The old lady, Bart in tow, rings the doorbell at the Simpson
residence.

Homer: Just a minute!  [sounds of grunting and paper tearing]  Hello?
Belle: Your son was trespassing on my property and destroyed a very
       valuable stone gargoyle and... are you wearing a grocery bag?
Homer: I have misplaced my pants.
-- 

Homer doesn't seem concerned at all with all the trouble Bart got
himself into, but changes his mind when the lady threatens to talk to
Bart's mother. He promises to handle this.

Homer: Aw, I don't know how to punish you.  What does Marge usually do?
 Bart: She makes me taste beer.
Homer: Come on, boy, give your old man a little credit.
        [the bag bursts, sending a load of groceries to the floor]
-- The perils of improvised clothing, 

As a solution, Homer drops his boy in front of the mansion.

Homer: Now you're gonna do chores for that lady until you work off the 
       damage you did.  It's called "responsibility."
       [drives forward, and crushes the mailbox]
       [screams, backs off and drives away]
-- Do as I say...  

The lady lets him in.

Bart: I can't believe I've gotta spend all my free time dusting doilies
      in a smelly run-down dump for a creepy old witch.
       [pulls a curtain, behind which we see a number of scantily-clad
       girls dancing can-can and people gambling]
      Lady, I gotta tell ya, I have been grossly misinformed about
      witches.
-- That's "wiccans" to you, 

The girls pull off a last "leg up" in front of the camera.

[End of Act One.  Time: 8:02]

 Bart: Wow, man, what is this place?
Belle: I prefer not to be called "man."  My name is Belle, and this is
       the Maison Derriere.  That means the, uh, "Back House."
-- 

Belle explains that this is a burlesque house, "a private club where
gentlemen can play some cards and see a show." A girl from the "Around
the World" number comes in, asking for Monte Carlo's dice; Belle hands
her what is in fact a bra. Bart observes, his jaw dropped.

Belle: Normally, we don't allow children in here, but your father was so
       insistent.
 Bart: He's tough but fair.  I'll start sorting these bras.
Belle: That's a bit advanced for you, but I know a stopped-up sink that
       needs some attention.
 Bart: Just glad to be on the team.
-- 

Next thing, Belle introduces Bart to other tasks.

Belle: When you work the door, the main things are to greet the visitors
       and toss out the troublemakers.
 Bart: Ah, the ol' greet'n'toss.  No problemo.
Belle: How did I ever get along without you?
-- Bart finds his niche, 

Among the patrons of the Maison Derriere is one Abraham J. Simpson.

Grampa: [whistles, hangs his hat]
        [seeing Bart] Oop.
        [whistles again, turns around, picks up his hat and leaves]
        [sticking his head in]  Is your name "Bart"?
  Bart: [nodding] Mm-hmm.
Grampa: What the... Does your father know you're working here?
  Bart: It was his idea.
Grampa: In that case, I'll have a whiskey sour.
-- Taking it in stride, 

Meanwhile, Marge and the girls are hard at work scrubbing oil-covered
rocks.

 Lisa: Oh, there's something unsatisfying about scrubbing these rocks
       and I think I know what it is.
        [a wave washes a new coat of oil on the once-clean rocks]
Marge: Lisa, I know it's frustrating, but we made a commitment, and we
       have to see it through, no matter how unpleasant.
        [the cleanup guy drives up]
  Man: Quitting time.  Okay.  Scrub up and head for the communal tarp.
       We're having kelpburgers, and we're going to watch a tape of
       Johnny Arvik, he's the Eskimo comedian.
        [Marge and Lisa stare at him for a moment]
        [the next thing you know, they're driving away]
 Lisa: Faster, Mom, faster!
-- 

At the Maison Derriere, Belle hangs up the phone.

Belle: Oh, that was our emcee, Mel Zetz.  He got out of bed too fast and 
       broke his hip.
 Bart: So who's gonna warm up the crowd tonight?
Belle: Well, whoever fits Mel's tuxedo.  [Size: extra small]
 Bart: Eep.
Belle: The jokes are in the breast pocket.  If you get in trouble,
       there's a switch that makes the bow tie spin.
        [the tie spins while making an amusing noise]
-- 

Bart is on stage, reading the jokes rather lamely.

Bart: Heh, nudist colonies are everywhere these days.  I'd love to go,
      but I...  [stares at the card]  can't get the wrinkles out of my
      birthday suit.
       [rim shot, heavy laughs]
       [Bart looks at the card again in disbelief]
      But, I gotta tell you, Adam and Eve must have been the first
      bookkeepers.  They invented the "loose-leaf" system.
       [rim shot, more laughs]
      If there's a bad bookkeeping joke, I haven't heard it.
-- Bart does stand-up in the Maison Derriere, 

Back at Evergreen Terrace, Homer is watching television.

Announcer: It's eleven o'clock.  Do you know where your children are?
    Homer: I told you last night, no!
-- Argueing with public messages, 

Where is Bart anyway?  His dinner is getting all cold and eaten.  [picks
at Bart's dinner]
-- Homer, 

Homer drives to the Maison Derriere, where he barges inside.

Bart, where are you?  Come on!  I have to be up at 6am to swipe
Flanders' newspaper.
-- Homer, 

Homer takes a moment to look at a picture.

"President Eisenhower celebrates 40th wedding anniversary.  Not
pictured, Mrs. Eisenhower."
-- 

Belle: I'm sorry.  This is all my fault.  Bart was filling in for...
Homer: I don't care if he was filling in for Mel Zetz, he's my son, and
       I don't want him working...
        [in the next room, Homer sees a sexy chorus girl doing a fan
        dance]
       ...so...late....that...
Belle: Oh, I agree, kids need rules and boundaries.
Homer: [trancelike] Yes, everyone loves rules.
Belle: It's so tough to be a parent these days, what with all the gangs
       and the drugs.
Homer: Oh yeah, drugs, you gotta have drugs.
        [Homer goes in to see the fan dancer]
 Bart: Hey, he didn't pay the cover.
Belle: Oh, Bart, he's your father.  We'll comp him tonight, start a tab 
       tomorrow.
-- 

Principal Skinner enters.  He obviously doesn't see the new doorman.

Skinner: Oh, I hope I didn't miss the floor show.
   Bart: Nope.
Skinner: Is Roxanne back?
   Bart: Yep.
Skinner: Did she, uh, get my flowers?
   Bart: She did.
Skinner: [Finally noticing his fourth-grade nemesis] Hello, Bart.
   Bart: Hello, Principal Skinner.
Skinner: This is the National Air and Space Museum, isn't it?
-- Nice try, Seymour, 

The doorbell rings.  Homer answers it and sees the "God Squad" of the
Lovejoys and the Flanderseses.

  Homer: Uh, this isn't going to be about Jesus, is it?
Lovejoy: All things are about Jesus, Homer, except this.  
-- 

Lovejoy: Your son has been working in a burlesque house.
  Helen: Principal Skinner saw him with his own eyes.
Skinner: [appearing from being Rev. Lovejoy]  That's true, but I was
         only in there to get directions on how to get away from there.
-- Suuuuuuure, 

Homer tells them that he is already well aware of his son's
employment.

  Ned: Homer?  I'm as permissive as the next parent, I mean, just
       yesterday I let Todd buy some red-hots with a cartoon devil on
       the box, but you can't possibly think it's appropriate for your
       ten-year-old son to work in a burlesque house!
Homer: Oh, no?  Well, if Homer Simpson wants his ten-year-old son working in 
       a burlesque house, then Homer Simpson's ten-year-old son is going to
       work in a burlesque house!  That...
        [his visitors walk away, revealing Marge]
       Ha-ha-ha...  Hi!  Now, Marge, you're gonna hear a lot of crazy
       talk about Bart working in a burlesque house...
-- Backpedaling, 

[End of Act Two.  Time: 12:49]

Marge contemplates a Maison Derriere matchbook, still shocked to learn
the existence of such a place in her little town.

Marge: Homer, did you know it was a burlesque house when you sent Bart
       to work there?
Homer: No, I only learned that four days ago.
-- And he's been working there five days, right?, 

Marge: What were you thinking, sending Bart to such an awful place?
Homer: I was trying to punish him exactly like you would.  [sly] So in a
       way, you really dropped the ball on this one.  This is your mess,
       and I'll be damned if I'm going to clean it up.
-- He's got her with his legal mumbo-jumbo, 

The trick doesn't work.  Marge visits the Maison Derriere and asks a
favor of Belle: to close the house down and move away.

Marge: Springfield doesn't want places like this.
Belle: I think I know what Springfield wants, sugar.
Marge: Oh?  I've lived in this town for thirty-seven years.
Belle: I've lived here fifty-two years.
Marge: I'm third generation.
Belle: Sixth.
Marge: [pause] Get outta my town!
-- If you can't beat 'em through argument, use invective,
      

We're just as much a part of Springfield as the church, the library or
the crazy house.
-- Belle illustrates the diversity of Springfield, 

Belle teases Marge as a "neighbor", but Springfield's watchdog doesn't
give up.

Sleazy entertainment and raunchy jokes will never be as popular as
sobriety and self-denial.
-- The world according to Marge, 

"You're about to learn the two most dangerous words in the English
language are `Marge Simpson'" she threatens, before leaving.

Later, at a town meeting...

Quimby: ...and after visiting the area for, uh, the past two months, I
        have determined it is not feasible to construct a supertrain
        between Springfield and Aruba.  [removes his sunglasses]
         [audience groans]
        [with a tan]  Next on the agenda is, uh, the Citizens' Committee
        on Moral Hygiene.
         [audience groans]
-- This isn't as fun a meeting as I had anticipated, 

   Marge: I'm here to share my moral outrage.  But this time it's not
          about that giant inflatable "Dos Equis" bottle.  It's about a
          certain house in our town.
     Moe: Yeah, well what's wrong with this house?  Is it the plumbing?
   Marge: No.  It's a house of ill fame.  A house of loose ethics.
Brockman: Is there a building code violation?  A drainage issue?  A 
	  surveying error?
   Marge: [annoyed] The house is perfectly fine!
  Wiggum: Well, then quite bad-mouthing the house!
    Otto: Yeah, leave the house alone!
-- The perils of speaking figuratively, 

Marge says she is talking about the burlesque house, a place of
"drinking, gambling and debauchery."  The audience gasps.

 Quimby: People, this is an issue that we as a town are strong enough to 
         ignore.  Let us give no more scrutiny to this bawdy house and
         its small clientele of loyal perverts.
Lovejoy: Oh, I'm afraid this problem goes far beyond Eugene and Rusty.
          [said perverts chuckle uncomfortably]
-- I'll bet they're with AOL, 

The lights go out and a slide show of Maison Derriere patrons begins
(their eyes covered to protect their identity).  However, in such a
small town where everybody wears the same clothes day after day...

                    [slide of Dr. Hibbert]
     Mrs. Hibbert: Julius!
                    [slide or Chief Wiggum]
      Mrs. Wiggum: Clancy!
                    [slide of Skinner]
         Chalmers: Skinner?
            Agnes: Seymour!
          Seymour: Mother...
                    [slide of Patty]
            Selma: [off-screen] Patty?
                    [slide of Cletus]
         Brandine: Cletus!
                    [slide of Barney, to which nobody reacts]
              Moe: ... Oh, uh... [forced] Barney.
                    [slide of Chief Wiggum]
      Mrs. Wiggum: Clancy!
     Chief Wiggum: Hey, come on, you did me twice.
                    [slide of... Smithers?!]
            Burns: Smithers?
         Smithers: My... my parents insisted I give it a try, sir.
                    [slide of Quimby, wearing a "Mayor" sash]
Luanne Van Houten: Mayor Quimby!
           Quimby: Uh, well, that could be any mayor.
-- A typical town meeting slide show, 


Er, uh, well... eh, in light of these new facts, of which I now realize
I was largely aware, I must take action. All in favor of demolishing our
beloved burlesque house, raise your hands.
-- Mayor "Diamond Joe" Quimby, 

Few do, until the Citizens' Committee on Moral Hygiene turn around and
stare. All hands spring up.

Jasper: [whispering] Are they talking about the bordello?
   Abe: No!  The burlesque house.  So just keep your mouth shut.
-- Some ill-fame will remain, 

It doesn't take too long for a mob to form and convene at the Maison
Derriere.

Skinner: Oh, there's no justice like angry-mob justice.
  Lenny: I'm gonna burn all the historic memorabilia
    Moe: I'm gonna take me home a toilet.
  Willy: Well, there'd better be two.
-- Pre-mob-demolition talk, 

Ned rings.

Belle: [through intercom]  Who is it?
  Ned: Uh, it's an angry mob, ma'am.  Could you step outside for a
       twinkle while we knock down your house?
Belle: Just a minute.
-- Make yourselves at home, 

Rev. Lovejoy forces the gates open, and the mob walks in, faced by
Belle and the girls, who walk out of the house.  After a brief bit of
name-calling, the crowd begins to break apart the house.  Bart tells
Homer to do something.

Homer: My friends!  Stop!
        [the mob stops, intrigued]
 Hans: [stretching a bow and flaming arrow]  Please, hurry...
Homer: Sure. We could tear this house down...
        [mob cheers and resumes smashing]
Homer: No!  My friends!  Stop!  Let me finish.
-- Mob mentality and intelligence, 

Homer declares that if they destroy the burlesque house, they are
destroying a part of themselves.  Follows a musical number which
slowly wins the heart of all mobsters.

    Ned: Well, I'm convinced.  The house stays.
Lovejoy: This house is a very, very, very fine house.
-- In the middle of the street?  

Marge arrives hell-bent for leather on a bulldozer.  "Here I come,
everybody!"  The crowd forces her to stop.

  Homer: What are you doing, Marge?  Didn't you hear the song?
  Marge: No, I had to go rent the bulldozer.
    Ned: Well, we all changed our minds.
 Wiggum: Yeah, now we love the house.
  Marge: What about the sleaze and the depravity?
  Helen: It was a very convincing song, Marge!
Skinner: Mm-hm, there were kicks and everything.
  Marge: Oh.  Can you sing it again?
    Ned: I'm sorry, it really was one of those spur-of-the-moment type 
	 things.
-- Did they lie to you through song? 

Marge: Well, I also have a song to sing.
        [flaming arrow pass by her head]
       Don't make up your mind until you hear both songs.
       [clears throat, coughs]
       [singing off key]  Morals and ethics and carnal forbearance...
-- Marge's lame attempt at follow-up, 

Meanwhile, she hits the brake lever of the bulldozer, which tears down
part of the Maison Derriere.  Oops.

  Marge: Uh... sorry.
Lovejoy: Thanks a lot, Marge. That was our only burlesque house.
  Belle: I do love it when you drop by, Marge. Next time, why don't we
         get together at your house.
-- 

Marge asks how she can possibly ever make it up?  "Oh, there's a way,
Mom," Bart answers smugly.

At what remains of Maison Derriere, Marge is doing a ventriloquist act
with a doll that looks just like her.

   Marge: So, Twiggy, I hear you and your husband, Woody, just had a
          baby.  What did you name him?
"Twiggy": Chip.
           [Rim shot.  No laughs.]
   Homer: Take it off!
    Bart: [as a bouncer]  All right, Dad, you've been warned, let's go.
-- Hall monitor experience put to good use, 

[End of Act Three.  Time: 21:28]

Instead of the normal closing theme music, we are treated to an
instrumental reprise of "We Put The Spring in Springfield."

 EPISODE TITLE: A Milhouse Divided


EPISODE SUMMARY:   {dga}

Dinnertime at the Simpsons.  Everyone is watching TV, which Homer
can't quite do when he's licking his plate clean.

Marge, can't we get some clear plates?  I can't see the TV!
-- Practical Homer, 

Marge wonders aloud if it is necessary to watch TV while they are
eating, since they are getting food all over.  Just then, a meatball
falls to the floor, eyed by Maggie, Santa's Little Helper and Snowball
II.  Each of them tenses, prepared for the kill, when suddenly, Homer
reaches down and secures it with a fork.  "Yoink!"

 Bart: If you really wanted us to be neater, you'd serve us out of one 
       long bowl.
Marge: You're talking about a trough.  We're not going to eat from a
       trough.  And another thing, it's only 5:15.  Why are you in your
       underwear?
 Bart: Hey, this ain't the Ritz.
-- New tenets of the Bart philosophy, 

Marge tries to start a conversation with Lisa, who seems too absorbed
with what's on TV.

Marge: I'm going into the dining room to have a conversation.  Anyone
       who wants to join me is welcome.
        [she walks off]
Marge: [off-screen]  Hello, Marge.  How's the family?
       [in a different tone]  I don't want to talk about it. Mind your
       own business.
Homer: Keep it down in there, everybody!
-- 

Later that night, Marge speaks to Homer in bed.

Marge: Homer, is this the way you pictured married life?
Homer: Yeah, pretty much.  Except we drove around in a van solving 
       mysteries.
-- 

But Marge pictured a more social life.

Marge: Homer, I want to throw a dinner party.
Homer: [whining] Oh, I hate having parties.  The toilet always gets 
       backed up.
Marge: I don't care if the sink shoots sludge.  We're having a party.
-- Are there enough gag ice-cubes?  

The next day, our favorite family visits "Stoner's Pot Palace."

Man, that is flagrant false advertising!
-- Otto leaving "Stoner's Pot Palace", 

Marge browses through the sophisticated kitchen accessories.

It's just not a dinner party without a melon baller.  And we'll need a
citrus zester, a ravioli crimper...  Ooh, an oyster mallet!  Made in
USA?  Oh, no, thank you.
-- Patriotic Marge, 

Bart shows Lisa a non-stick wok, into which he drops Maggie.  She
proves that it is indeed frictionless as she slides inside it, popping
up on each side.

In another part of the store, Marge gasps at a huge crystal punchbowl.

Marge: Ooh!  A punchbowl like that just screams good taste.  Wouldn't it
       be perfect for the dinner party.
Homer: Oh, we can't afford that.  Who do you think I am, Liz Taylor?
Marge: Well, maybe we could use it once, and then return it.
Homer: Marge, we're not talking about a toothbrush here.
-- How about the one that Flanders threw away?  

It is sometime later, as the house is impeccably set for the upcoming
party.

Marge: Bart, company's coming, go put doilies under the coasters, hurry,
       hurry!
        [the dishwasher dings]
        [Marge opens it to reveal four toilet seats inside]
Marge: Lisa, quick, screw these back on!
 Lisa: Mom, calm down, the party's not for another three hours!
Marge: Oh, good!  That will give me time to add another coat of glaze to
       the ham.  [she opens the oven to reveal said meat glowing almost
       radioactively]
-- The conscientious party-giver, 

Marge takes a look at the splendid table she set. However, one candle
is longer than the other; she resolves the problem by taking a bite of
it.

Next, she inspects the adorably-dressed children, and gives Bart a
quick spit-bath, to which he objects.  Then, she looks for her truant
husband.

Marge: Homer!
Homer: What?!
Marge: Are you ready?
Homer: Just gotta put my shoes on!
        [Homer is in his underwear, playing with slot-cars]
Marge: The only thing I asked you to do for this party was put on
       clothes, and you didn't do it.
-- Knowing his limitations, 
         
But it's too late, the doorbell already rings. Homer runs away while
Marge instructs Bart to take the guests' coats.

   Bart: Mom, Reverend Lovejoy doesn't have a coat.  Should I let him 
         in?
Lovejoy: My coat was stolen at last week's interfaith banquet.  So I 
         helped myself to a few of the better umbrellas.
-- Turning the other cheek, 

The next family to arrive is the Hibberts.  Julious gives his fur coat
to Bart.

Well, as you can see, we don't believe fur is murder.  But paying for it
sure is!
-- Julius Hibbert, no friend of PETA, 
   
Next are the Van Houtens.

Kirk: Uh, sorry we're late, but Luanne had to put on her face.  She
      doesn't want anyone to know she's got no eyebrows.
       [Luanne looks at her husband under bizarrely-slanted brows]
      What?  You don't!
-- Sight gags of the world, unite!  

While the children have a party of their own in another room -- with
Bart's grimaces as the center of attention -- the adults dine and
converse.

 Marge: Did anyone see that new Woodsy Allen movie?
   Ned: You know, I like his films except for that nervous fellow that's
        always in them.
-- 

But something's not right with the Van Houtens.

Luanne: If you want to talk nervous, you should've seen Kirk deal with
        the high-school kids who egged our Bonneville.
  Kirk: Ha.  Should've asked them to hurl some bacon.  Then maybe I
        could have had a decent breakfast for once.
         [long pause, everyone is uneasy]
 Homer: You know what you two need?  A little comic strip called "Love
        Is..."  It's about two naked eight-year-olds who are married.
         [even longer pause]
-- Not Lisa and Ralph, I hope, 

Once everyone's done eating, Julius congratulates Marge on the meal,
but Kirk can only think about stabbing at Luanne, saying he's never
eaten that well since he was in the army. Once again, everyone is
uneasy.

After Luanne gets in a quick dig at her husband, Marge loudly suggests
everyone go play a game.  It's Pictionary, done on a giant pad.  First
up, the Flanderses.

  Ned: Oh, that's a noodle-scratcher.
       [starts drawing a few random dots]
Maude: [gasps] Cornstarch!
  Ned: Oh, righty-o!  [both laugh] It's good for keepin' down the urges!
-- I thought that's what saltpeter was for... 

Next up are the Van Houtens.

   Kirk: Ah, come on Luanne, you know what this is.
 Luanne: Kirk, I don't know what it is.
   Kirk: [sighs] It could not be more simple, Luanne.  You want me to 
         show this to the cat, and have the cat tell you what it is?  
         'Cause the cat's going to get it.
 Luanne: I'm sorry, I'm not as smart as you, Kirk.  We didn't all go to 
         Gudger College.
          [timer dings]
   Kirk: It's dignity!  Gah!  Don't you even know dignity when you see 
         it?
 Luanne: Kirk, you're spitting.
   Kirk: Okay, genius, why don't you draw dignity.
          [she does so]
          [everyone gasps in recognition -- we can't see it, however]
Hibbert: Worthy of Webster's.  
-- Next, she'll show us where Springfield is on a map,
      

Kirk fights back, and Rev. Lovejoy tries to interpose.

Lovejoy: Now, Kirk, it's only a game. Sometimes, we...
   Kirk: Aw, cram it, churchy!
-- Should've kept that one for Sunday's sermon, 

Marge tries to cheer up the atmosphere, but it's a desperate cause.

 Kirk: Why don't you tell them one of your little bedtime stories, huh?
       Like the one about how rotten it is to be married to a loser.  Or
       how about the one about how I carry a change purse?  Yeah, a
       purse!
Homer: Shut up and let the woman talk.
-- Aw, we were getting to the good stuff now, 

 Luanne: Okay, Kirk, I'll tell a story.  It's about a man whose father-
         in-law gave him a sweet job as manager of a cracker factory.
  Homer: Bo-ring.
 Luanne: A man whose complete lack of business sense and managerial 
         impotence...
  Homer: Ooh, here we go!
 Luanne: ...sent the number one cracker factory in town into a tie for 
         sixth with "TableTime" and "Allied Biscuit."
          [Marge furtively hides a box of "Allied Biscuit"]
-- The Van Houtens fight at the Simpsons, 

   Kirk: You want to hear a secret, everybody?  Luanne loves it, loves
         it when I fail.
 Luanne: Oh yes, Kirk.  I love having to borrow money from my sister.
         I love having to steal clothes from the church donation box.
Lovejoy: [quietly] Oh, sweet Jesus.
-- Knowing a little too much, 
  
Marge attempts to defuse the situation.

Marge: Lisa, why don't you come sing for us?
 Lisa: [marching and singing] You're a grand old flag...
 Kirk: Oh, great, you got the kid singing.  I hope you're happy now.
-- Another unappreciated talent, 

But Luanne is not happy, and has not been for a long time. The time
has come for...

 Luanne: I want a divorce!
          [everyone gasps]
   Kirk: [surprised] I... I... a divorce?
         [resolute] Sure.  Divorce.  Hey, you got it toots!  And here's
         a picture even you can figure out!
         [draws a circle in a rectangle]  It's a door!  Use it!
  Homer: That's a door?
-- This wouldn't have happened if they had played "Jenga", "A Milhouse 
   Divided"

Upstairs, Milhouse and Bart are putting on a different kind of
"doctor" act.

    Bart: [deep voice] Hello, I'm Doctor Hibbert.  I'm afraid I'm going 
          to have to amputate... your butt.  [chuckles]
Milhouse: [falsetto] All right, if you think you must.
           [kids laugh]
  Luanne: Come on, Milhouse, we're going.
Milhouse: Aw, can't I come home later?
  Luanne: There's not going to be a home later.
Milhouse: Oh.  Okay.  [falsetto] Ta-ta!  I'm off to the beauty salon!
-- Playing doctor, after a fasion, 

Homer says goodbye to the departing guests.

Homer: Well, I think that went pretty well.
        [outside, Luanne speeds away, leaving Kirk behind]
 Kirk: [to staring Homer and Marge]  What?
-- Nah, happens to everybody, 

[End of Act One.  Time: 8:05]

Later that night, Marge and Homer are in bed.  Marge seems upset,
Homer, less so.

Marge: I feel terrible.  The Van Houtens split up at our party.
Homer: Marge, please, that was twenty minutes ago.
Marge: I shouldn't have served those North Korean fortune cookies. They
       were so insulting: "You are a coward."  No one likes to hear that
       after a nice meal.
Homer: You can't keep blaming yourself.  Just blame yourself once, and 
       move on.
-- The supportive husband, 

Marge notes that the real victim in the whole situation will be
Milhouse.

Next morning, Bart and Milhouse are sitting on the schoolbus.  Nelson
approaches them, not to mock them, but to share the story of her
mother who got hooked on cough drops. "By the end, her breath was so
fresh, she wasn't really my mother anymore."

Kearney: Ah, you'll do fine.  My divorce was tough on my kid, but he got
         over it.
          [sits back to reveal a miniature doppelganger]
    Kid: I sleep in a drawer!
-- And his cat's name is "Mittens", 

At the Van Houten residence, Luanne sings quietly to herself as she
packs and labels a box full of her ex's shirts.  "I must say, Luanne,
you're really handling this splendidly" comments Marge.  She changes
her mind when Luanne pours lighter fluid on the box and sets it on
fire.

Luanne: From now on, forget everything you thought you knew about Luanne 
        Van Houten.
 Marge: Actually, Luanne, I don't really know anything about you...
Luanne: Forget it!  She's gone.  Prest-o change-o!  Kaboom!  Sweet Fanny
        Adams!  Bye-bye!
-- Whatever they're giving her, cut the dose, 

Homer is visiting Kirk at his apartment at the Casa Nova.

 Kirk: Singles life is great, Homer.  I can do whatever I want.  Today I 
       drank a beer in the bathroom.
Homer: The one down the hall.
 Kirk: Yeah!  And another great thing, you get your own bed.  I sleep in 
       a racing car, do you?
Homer: I sleep in a big bed with my wife.
 Kirk: Oh.  Yeah.  
-- Bringing up painful memories, 

The door knocks.  Kirk answers to a group of people.

 Man: Hey, there, Kirk...
Kirk: [excited] Oh, boy, what's going on?  Patio party?
 Man: No, a possum drowned in the pool.  You have any garbage bags?
-- Single life at its best, 

Kirk tells them to throw it over the fence, and "let Arby's worry
about it".

 Kirk: That's Jerry.  He's a major player down at the sewing store.
Homer: [mocking] Well, thanks for introducing me.
 Kirk: Oh, don't worry, Homer.  You know me, and I'm a superstar at
       the cracker factory.
-- Ooh, so many influential people, 

Fade to the cracker factory, where said superstar is being called on
the carpet.

Kirk: You're letting me go?!
Boss: Kirk, crackers are a family food.  Happy families.  Maybe single 
      people eat crackers, we don't know.  Frankly, we don't want to
      know.  It's a market we can do without.
Kirk: So that's it, after twenty years: "So long, good luck"?
Boss: I don't recall saying "good luck."
-- Rim shot, 

At home, Milhouse is driving a miniature car around a room, wreaking
great havoc as Bart watches.

Milhouse: [makes racing noises] And the winner of the Milhouse 500 is...
          Milhouse!
  Luanne: [from another room]  Milhouse, are you sure you want to drive
          that inside?
Milhouse: Yes!
  Luanne: Okay!  Be careful, sweet, sweet treasure!
-- The joys of being a child from a broken home, 
   
The doorbell rings.  It's Luanne's new boyfriend, Chase, full-time
stuntman, part-time American Gladiator.  He demonstrates his abilities
by letting Bart smash a chair over him.  Then he and Luanne go out on
the town in his gladitorial vehicle.

Bart tries the same stunt with Homer taking his bath, who takes it
less well.

Homer: OW!  Ow!  Gee...  Ow!  What the hell is wrong with you?!
 Bart: Geez, sor-ry.  It's a pretty standard stunt, Homer.
-- Did you get smashed by a chair today?, 

Marge calls up to remind them that they are going to hear Spalding
Gray with Luanne and Chase, but Homer doesn't want to go.

Marge: You said you'd do it as a favor to me.
Homer: That doesn't sound like something I'd say.
Marge: Fine.  I'll go without you.
Homer: Okay.  Love ya.
-- Stable relationship, 

Homer enters Moe's Tavern, where he sees Kirk with a floozy named
Starla, supposedly working at KZOG 530. She asks for the car keys ("I
feel like changing wigs"), and Kirk is just about to explain how
she'll help him launch his singing carreer when the sound of tires
squealing is heard. Kirk and Homer rush out, and Starla tosses a tape
at them before she drives away.

 Krik: Oh, my demo tape!
Homer: [Homer examines the tape] "Can I Borrow a Feeling?"
       [laughing] "Can I Borrow a Feeling?"
       [continues laughing] That's your picture on the front...
       [still laughing]
 Kirk: [peeved] Go ahead, Homer, laugh at me.
Homer: I already did.
-- And how!    
  
Kirk confides in Homer, saying he's got a lot of blame into his
situation.  He notes that he never saw it coming.  "One day, your wife
is making you your favorite meal.  The next day you're thawing a hot
dog in a gas station sink."

Homer: Oh, that's tough, pal.  But it's never gonna happen to me.
 Kirk: Well, how do you know?  What makes you so special?
Homer: 'Cause Marge and I have one thing that can never be broken: a
       strong marriage built on a solid foundation of routine.
-- Secret of a successful marriage II, 

Somewhat later, Homer comes home.  It's dark, and Homer calls to his
wife.

Homer: [calling out] Marge, I'm home!  Where are you?  Are you okay?  I 
       don't smell dinner.  [he finds a note and reads it aloud]
       "Dear Homer."  Aww.  "Sorry you didn't want to join me tonight. I
       left you hot dogs for dinner.  They're thawing in the sink."
        [dramatic music plays with close-up on the dogs]
Homer: [screams]
-- The hot dogs never lie, 

[End of Act Two.  Time: 14:11]

A despondent Homer sits on the kitchen floor, dipping the dogs into a
jar of mustard.  Lisa comes in and opens the refrigerator.  "You know,
there's buns in the cabinet" she comments.  Homer asks her help.

Homer: I know you're only eight years old, and I don't want to put a lot
       of pressure on you, but you've got to save my marriage!
 Lisa: Oh.  Okay.  Can I stay up?
Homer: [thinks]  All right.
-- Cheap advice, 

Homer tells Lisa that he's worried that Marge might be thinking about
divorce.

 Lisa: You've done a lot of crazy stuff over the years and she stood by 
       you.  Why would she leave you now?
Homer: [frantic] Cause there's lots of stuff she doesn't know about!
 Lisa: You mean, like your poker shack out in the swamp?
Homer: Uh-huh.
 Lisa: She knows.
-- No Cuban cigars, I hope, 

Homer complains that they started off on the wrong foot.  We flashback
briefly to Marge and Homer's state-line marriage from [8F10].
Afterwards, we see them sitting outside a truck stop.

Homer: See?  You don't need to spend a lot of money to have a first-
       class wedding reception.
        [open a box, revealing a whale-shaped cake reading "To a Whale
        of a Wife"]
Marge: [sighs]  It's getting less and less likely you're going to yell
       "surprise" and have all my friends jump out.
        [Homer is fascinated by a Levi's truck passing by]
Homer: "Levi's."  Hey, you think that truck is full of jeans?
-- This wouldn't have happened if she'd married Ted Bessell,
      

Back to the present...

 Lisa: You're very lucky to have Mom.  [walks away]
Homer: [pause, dejected]  That's your advice?  Go to bed!
-- You get what you pay for, 

Homer thinks a moment about his situation, and gets an idea.  Early
the next morning, he greets his still-sleeping wife.

Homer: You know, Marge, I was thinking about how much I enjoy your
       interest.  So I wandered over to that theater you went to last
       night and I bought tickets to their entire season.
       Look, "Mostly Madrigals"...  [faking interest]  Yeah, that might
       be good.
       Ooh, ooh, "An Evening with Philip Glass."  [overacting]  Just an
       evening?
       "Voices of the Elderly Poor."  Hmmm...
-- You can throw away your sleeping pills, 

Marge: Homey, I appreciate this, but I'd really like to get some sleep.
Homer: Oh, of course, my sweet.  I'll just make some soothing ocean
       sounds for you.
       [blows, imitating waves]
       [imitates foghorn]
       [squawks loudly, upsetting Marge]
       [blows again]
       [Long John Silver] Arr, matey!
-- I hate the sea and everything in it, 

Homer follows Marge to the hair stylist's ("The Perm Bank"), where he
begins snipping at her bouffant.  Marge can't believe that he's doing
something so stupid, and sends him away.  Homer decides that a "few
clumsy gestures aren't going to make up for ten years of neglect," and
that Marge deserves a fresh start.

Cut to... Springfield city offices.

Homer: I'd like to file for... divorce.
Clerk: These things happen.  Eight dollars.
-- I wonder when she lost her passion for this work,
      

Marge and the kids return home from the dentist.

Only three cavities, Bart, your best checkup ever!  I'm going to make
you my specialty, butterscotch chicken.
-- Yum, Marge, 

From the other room, Homer calls Marge to talk with him.  When she
steps in, all her friends and relatives jump out.  Surprise!

Homer: Marge, will you marry me?
Marge: Why?  Am I pregnant?
-- The best reason of all, 

Homer explains.

Homer: It's a second wedding, honey.  Our first one was so crummy, I had
       to make it up to you.  I really love you.
Marge: Oh, Homey.  I know you love me.  We don't need to get married
       again.
Homer: Yes, we do, I got us a divorce this afternoon.
Marge: What?
Homer: I didn't want a hokey second wedding like those ones on TV.  
-- A little meta-humor for your enjoyment, 

Homer continues that he doesn't want their relationship to end up like
the Van Houtens.  "It never will," Marge says.

Lovejoy: Dearly beloved...
  Homer: Wait!  I want one last chance to enjoy single life.  [scratches 
         his butt and belches]  Okay, ready.
-- And his single life is different from his married life in what way?,
      

I will now read these special vows which Homer has prepared for this 
occasion.  "Do you, Marge, take Homer, in richness and in poorness" --
poorness is underlined -- "in impotence and in potence, in quiet
solitude or blasting across the alkali flats in a jet-powered, monkey-
navigated"... [consults the notecards]  ... and it goes on like this.
-- Rev. Lovejoy officiates the Simpson's wedding,   

Marge says "I will."  After Homer struggles to take off Marge's ring
and slip it back again ("come on, you stupid..."), Lovejoy pronounces
them husband and wife.

In the reception, as some jazz band (with a former member of the
Doobie Brothers) plays, Kirk seizes the opportunity to sing (off-key)
an awful love song to Luanne.

  Kirk: How about it, Luanne?  Will you marry me... again?
Luanne: Ooh, no!
  Kirk: [moans]  Well... Uh, can I have my shirts back, at least?
 Chase: Okay, you heard the lady.  Why don't you take it outside, all
        right?
  Kirk: Uh, I'll be back.
         [door closes]
  Kirk: [through door] Pro-probably.
-- No Schwartzenegger for ya, 

[End of Act Three.  Time: 21:27]

The theme music plays in the style of a mellow 1970's love ballad.

 EPISODE TITLE: Lisa's Date With Density


EPISODE SUMMARY:   {ol}

At Springfield Elementry, Skinner prepares to have his lunch when
Chalmers barges into the lunchroom.

Chalmers: Skinner!!
 Skinner: [gasps]  Uh, Superintendant Chalmers!  [nervously pants]
          What's wrong?
Chalmers: [calmly] Nothing, I just bought myself a car.
 Skinner: Oh.  Oh good.  This'll sound crazy, but at first I, I thought
          I'd enraged you again.
Chalmers: SKINNER!!
 Skinner: What?  What!?
Chalmers: Ah, you're getting paranoid.
-- Just keeping you on your toes, 

Chalmers takes Skinner out to the parking lot to show his new set of
wheels.

You know, I used to think a car was just a way of getting from point A
to point B -- and on weekends, point C.  But that was the old me. That
man died the moment I laid eyes on a 1979 Honda Accord.
-- Chalmers, practical and emotional, 

Skinner admires Chalmers' old, tannish brown pride.

I've always admired car owners and I hope to be one myself as soon as I
finish paying off mother.  She insists I pay her retroactively for the
food I ate as a child.
-- Skinner's growing relationship, 

Chalmers start bragging about his car and his "superintendant money"
again, when he notices with horror that his "H" emblem has been
stolen.

What's the point in having a Honda if you can't show it off?
-- Perhaps it's best for everybody this way, 

Skinner calms him down and says he could find a replacement.  Moments
later, he finds a blue Hyundai and tries to swipe the "H" from it
using a screwdriver.  Kearney catches him outside a window in the
school, and yells at him to get away from his car. Skinner drops the
screwdriver and he and Chalmers flee.

Meanwhile, at the Kwik-E-Mart, Ned is buying groceries from Apu.
Making sure he's not observed, Homer gets a doughnut from the
"Self-Serve" doughnut cabinet and fiddles with it, chuckling.  He
nonchalantly goes to check out, but Apu soon realizes that there's
something wrong.  It seems that Homer tried to sneak various other
candies on top this doughnut to pass them off as sprinkles.

A Mounds bar is not a sprinkle.  A twizzler is not a sprinkle.  A Jolly
Rancher is not a sprinkle, sir.  Perhaps in Shangri-La they are, but not
in here.
-- Worldwide Kwik-E-Mart regulations, 

Foiled, Homer leaves.  "Thank you, come again!" bellows Apu from
inside the store.  Heading for his car, Homer finds police arresting
Jimmy "the scumbag" for using an auto-dialer for a telemarketing scam.

He's gonna rot in the slammer for the next twenty years.  Bread and
water, icy showers, guards whomping your ass round the clock, and the
only way out is suicide.
-- Chief Wiggum, 

Despite this warning, Homer has gotten an idea.

The children of Springfield Elementary have become suspects in the
theft of Chalmers' "H".  The four bad boy kids find the whole thing
funny.

Skinner: I'll tell you something that's not so funny.  Right now,
         Superintendant Chalmers is at home crying like a little girl.
          [everybody laugh]
         [chuckles]  I guess it is a little funny.
-- 

Bart's locker is the first locker to be checked.  Bart warns Skinner
against looking inside.  Skinner soon finds out that there are a half
a dozen eggs inside, all of which hit him in the face.  The last six
smack him also.

Everyone's lockers are checked, leaving only Nelson, "the bottom of
the barrel." Groundskeeper Willy pulls open Nelson's last.  "Ha-ha!"
exclaims Nelson after nothing is found in the locker.  Skinner is
shocked.

Damn!  Dang!  Darn!
-- Skinner, 

Skinner's beating manages to make the inner wall of the locker fall
down, revealing a wall with a hole in it big enough to carry numerous
items not belonging to Nelson, one of which, especially, is the "H".

 Skinner: [gasps] A principal's ransom in stolen goods!  Well, sir,
          who's "Ha-ha"-ing now?
  Nelson: I dunno.  But he's got lethal tuna breath.
    Kids: Oooooooh!
    Lisa: Who does Nelson think he's impressing, anyway, acting so
          coool all the time?
Milhouse: [trying to look impressive]  Not me!
-- As cool as a cooler, 

Skinner: All right, Mr. Smartenheimer, that does it.  First, you're
         going to give back everything you've stolen.  Then, I'm
         sentencing you to one week of the lowest, most degrading work
         known to man -- janitorial work.
  Willy: Ah, geez.  I'm standing right here, sir.
Skinner: Ah, yes.  Uh...  Take a good look at him, Nelson, 'cause that's
         where you're headed.
-- 

In the gym class, kids are gathered to retrieve their stolen items,
then ask Nelson for an apology.  However, Nelson's not much in the
mood for excuses.

Nelson: [to a kid]  Bite me.
        [to Janey]  Cram it.
        [to Ralph]  You're dead.
        [to Mrs. Krabappel]  Get bent, Ma'am.
-- Ensuring good grades, 

Lisa is next.

  Lisa: Why do you have to be such a pain all the time?  Don't you
        realize you're getting a bad reputation?
Nelson: Don't you realize your butt sticks out?
-- 

To prove his point, Nelson kicks Lisa's butt when she looks behind
herself.  Follows the traditional "ha-ha", not to Lisa's amusement.

At home, Marge sees Homer put the auto-dialer next to the telephone.

Marge: An automatic dialer?  Is that legal?  I don't want you getting
       arrested, Homer.
Homer: I won't.
Marge: Or swindling our neighbors.
Homer: [pause]
-- Can I choose?, 

Homer proceeds to show Marge how this works.  He presses the "Dial"
button, and the machine dials 555-0001.  The first victim is Mr.
Burns.

Greetings, friends.  Do you wish to look as happy as me?  Well, you've
got the power inside you right now.  So, use it, and send one dollar to
Happy Dude, 742 Evergreen Terrace, Springfield.  Don't delay, eternal
happiness is just a dollar away.
-- Homer's take at telemarketing scam, 

One dollar for eternal happiness.  Mmmm...  I'd be happier with the
dollar.
-- Burns as we know him, 

Homer: Now we just sit by the mailbox and watch the money roll in.
Marge: But you're going to annoy thousands of people just to make a few
       measly dollars.  It's nothing but panhandling.
Homer: Tele-panhandling.
-- So that makes you tele-annoying, 

Back at Springfield Elementary, Mr. Largo is preparing the students
for a recital.

...and should there be requests for an encore, we will reprise "Pop Goes
the Weasel."  Otherwise, we will file out quietly.
-- Mr. Largo sums up the concert, 

Lisa's lets out a slight sigh of boredom when she hears a hose go off
outside. She looks outside the window to see Nelson helping Willy in
the schoolyard.

 Willy: And that's how Willy waters.  Now, you take the hoose.
Nelson: The moose?
 Willy: The HOOSE!  The HOOSE!
         [Willy gives the hose to Nelson]
Nelson: Is this right?  [sprays him]
 Willy: Aaugh!  Turn off the noozle!
Nelson: The noodles?  What noodles?
 Willy: The noozle at the end of the hoose!
-- 

Lisa giggles, only to be caught by Mr. Largo.

Miss Simpson?  Do you find something funny about the word tromboner?
-- Mr. Largo, losing our PG rating, 

   Sherri: She was looking at Nelson!
     Kids: [taunting] Lisa likes Nelson!
 Milhouse: She does not!
     Kids: [taunting] Milhouse likes Lisa!
    Janey: He does not!
     Kids: [taunting] Janey likes Milhouse!
     Uter: She does not!
     Kids: [taunting] Uter likes Milhouse!
Mr. Largo: Nobody likes Milhouse!
-- Well put, 

Mr. Largo calls for detention.  Later that day, Lisa writes "I will
not be a snickerpuss." on the blackboard.  There are four more
blackboards left.  By the second one, Lisa's hand has already become
tired.

Oooh.  How does Bart do this every week?
-- Lisa writing on the blackboard, 

Nelson passes by, taunting the "brainiac" about her detention, and
advises her to use "that deal with the five chalks" to go faster.
Lisa says she'll comply to the honest way instead, but it's not long
before she decides to use it anyway to complete her writings.

Once finished, she ponders how a good idea could ever come from
Nelson.  Looking out the window, she sees him beating a hive
surrounded by bees with a rake.  Lisa begins to think to herself.

He's not like anybody I've ever met.  He's like a riddle wrapped in an
enigma wrapped in a vest.  He sure is ugly, though.
-- Lisa thinks about Nelson, 

"So why can't I stop staring at him?", she wonders.  The answer
worries her: "Oh no!  I think I'm getting a crush on Nelson Muntz!"

Nelson holds the hive in the hive and calls out to Willy.  "Hey,
Willy! Catch the football!"  Nelson flings the bee hive at Willy. "All
right, I... Aaaaaaaaaaaah!!  Aaaaah aaaaah!!"  Lisa sighs dreamily.

[End of Act One.  Time: 8:08]

The next day, at lunchtime, Nelson's goofing off with Jimbo, Dolph and
Kearney.  At a table not too far away, Lisa talks to Milhouse.

    Lisa: Milhouse, I've never told anyone this kind of thing before,
          but I've never felt this way before.  I think I have a
          crush...
Milhouse: [gasps]  Oh!  Oh, really?  [suavely drinks from his milk
          carton]
    Lisa: ... on Nelson Muntz.
           [Milhouse gags, then spits his milk back into the straw,
           causing the carton to expolde and spill milk all over him]
  Nelson: Way to drink, poindexter!
-- 

Milhouse: You like Nelson?!  But he's a creep and he chipped one of my
          permanent teeth!
    Lisa: But I bet underneath he's a sweet, sensitive person... like
          you.
           [Milhouse makes an unflattered glare]
    Lisa: I guess you could say I'm wanna bring out the Milhouse in
          Nelson.
Milhouse: But I'm all Milhouse!  Plus, my mom says I'm the handsomest
          guy in school.
-- Ahem, 

    Lisa: I like you too, Milhouse, but not in that way.  You're like a
          big sister.
Milhouse: No, I'm not!  Why does everybody keep saying that?
    Lisa: Would you do me a favor?  When you get back to class, just
          give him this note.
Milhouse: [groans]
    Lisa: [insistent] Please?
Milhouse: [thinking] When she sees you'll do anything she says, she's
          bound to respect you.
          [aloud] Sure!  What's a big sister for?  [walks off]
          [to himself] Oh... I shouldn't have said that.
-- 

Back in class, the note is passed to Nelson.

Nelson: [reading] "Guess who likes you."  [turns around]
         [Milhouse wiggles his fingers at him]
-- That won't help, 

Next thing he knows, Milhouse is rushed out the school on a gurney,
his glasses wrecked and his nose leaking a stream of blood.

     Lisa: Milhouse, I'm so sorry!
Paramedic: He can't hear you now.  We had to pack his ears with gauze.
-- 

Milhouse is packed into an ambulance that speeds away.  Lisa catches
Nelson before he goes back to class.

  Lisa: Nelson!  Um... that note Milhouse gave you?  It wasn't from him.
        It was from... me.
Nelson: You?!  Why would you like me?  No girls like me.  [pause]  Are
        you wearing a wire?
  Lisa: I don't know why I like you, I just do.  So... what do you
        think?
Nelson: It's okay... I guess.  Do I have to do anything?
  Lisa: Well, would you like to come over to my house after school?
Nelson: Okay.  But if anybody sees us, I'm just there to steal your
        bike.
-- Nelson's views on dating, 

Homer maniacally drives home, anxiously running for the mailbox,
wherein lies a donation to Homer's "Happy Dude" sham.  He gets two
dollars.

 Homer: Woo-hoo!  Two dollars!  It's working!
         [at the Springfield Retirement Castle]
Grampa: I don't feel any happier.  How about you?
Jasper: Mmm... A little.
-- If you ever want to spell "pathetic", 

Nelson's in Lisa's room, on Lisa's bed.  Lisa rolls in a baby carriage
with Snowball II on her shoulder, and tries to show him how it can "be
the baby".  But after a lot of work and insistence, the cat just won't
give in and runs away.  Lisa affirms that she loves to climb in the
carriage.  "I believe you!  I don't care!" is Nelson's response.

Bart walks in.

Bart: Hey, Lis, Mom said you had the toenail clippers and...  Woah!
      Lisa, look out!  Nelson's in our house!
Lisa: It's okay.  I invited him over.  Nelson's my new... friend.
Bart: Are you nuts?  I'll probably never say this to you again, but...
      you can do better!
Lisa: Please don't ruin this for me, Bart.  I think he's starting to
      like me.
Bart: Milhouse likes you.
Lisa: Oh please!  Milhouse like Vaseline on toast!
Bart: Hmm.
-- Culinary curiosities, 

Homer's auto-dialer victimizer has hailed its own inventor, Prof.
Frink, who is having a chess game with an electronic hand.

No, pawns can't move that way, you stupid arm.
-- Frink plays chess agains his robotic arm, 

Frink answer the phone and recognizes the machine as his very first
patent.  Disappointed in how his machine is being used, he controls it
to extend its legs and wheel away back to him.  "Oh, no, you don't!"
claims Homer, chasing it down.  He removes the legs and brings it back
inside.

Nelson takes Lisa to his abode.

You're the first person I've had over to the house since my Dad went
nuts.
-- Nelson brings Lisa over, 

Underneath the welcome mat (stolen from Kwik-E-Mart, no less) are
cockroaches. On top Nelson's key to the house are more bugs Nelson has
to blow off.  Nelson invites Lisa inside and into his unkept bedroom.
Lisa discovers a poster on his wall of two whales being blown up.

  Lisa: [reading] "Nuke the whales?"  You don't really believe that, do
        you?
Nelson: I dunno.  Gotta nuke something.
  Lisa: Touche.
-- Tough argumentation, 

Finding a guitar, Lisa asks Nelson (who claims to be a superstar) to
play a song for her.  Nelson tunes it up a bit, then starts wildly
strumming a song.

Joy to the world the teacher's dead!
They barbecued her head!
What happened to her body?
We flushed it down the potty
And 'round and 'round it goes
And 'round and 'round it... goes...
-- Nelson's guitar talent, 

Nelson's ode is interrupted by Lisa's annoyed look, who doesn't laugh
at the idea of a teacher being decapitated.  Nelson decides to take a
nap, leaving it to her to find a way to get home.

In the family car, Lisa confides to her mother who picked her up,
admitting she's a fool to believe she could ever change Nelson.  But
Marge has some different advice.

Marge: When I first met your father, he was loud, crude and piggish.
       But I worked hard on him, and now, he's a whole new person.
 Lisa: Mom...?
Marge: He's a whole new person, Lisa.
 Lisa: Oh, I know.
-- You noticed?, 

She then wonders if the same miracle could be performed on Nelson.

Lisa's taken Nelson to "Wee Monsieur," where he sports a blue sweater,
a suit shirt, some slacks and a haircut.  He doesn't like it, but Lisa
thinks it highlights his sweet, sensitive side.  Nelson now knows what
he's gotten into.

Near the observatory, Lisa has a picnic with Nelson on a hill
overseeing the city at night.

  Lisa: Isn't it nice up here?  What are you thinking, Nelson?
Nelson: Am I thinking about what?
  Lisa: About anything.
Nelson: Nothin'.
  Lisa: [growls]  How do you feel?  What's inside you right now?
Nelson: Guts...  and black stuff...  and about fifty Slim Jims.
  Lisa: Come on, Nelson!  You must think and feel things.  I mean, look
        at where we are: a rolling, green hillside, the stars coming out
        like God is lighting a million tiny candles, the moon looking
        down on us as if to say...
         [Lisa turns to Nelson, who suddenly kisses her]
  Lisa: [thinking] My first kiss!  I always wondered what it would be
        like!
Nelson: This oughtta shut her up.
-- By any means necessary, 

But Nelson realizes "this isn't so bad", and they both close their
eyes and enjoy the moment.

[End of Act Two.  Time: 14:53]

Lisa and Nelson part lips.  She tells him that he does indeed have a
tender side, and only needed someone to bring it out.

Nelson looks warmly at Lisa, and takes her hand.  Their romantic
evening is spoiled by Jimbo, Dolph and Kearney.

    Dolph: Oh, man!  You kissed a girl!
    Jimbo: That is so gay!
     Lisa: Listen, you thugs. Stop making fun of him or you'll be sorry.
All three: [sarcastically] Woaaah!!
     Lisa: You'll be so sorry when you realize how you've hurt the
           feelings of a sweet young man.
-- That'll show them, 

Nelson puts his hand on his forehead and shakes his head.  Meanwhile,
Lisa goes on, calling them "crumb-bums", which Jimbo doesn't take
well. Fortunately, Nelson intervenes, telling Lisa to go have a fig
bar while he handles this.  She goes to the bench and eats.

Back to the crumb-bums, Nelson argues that he's still "wicked bad",
which Jimbo asks him to prove.

  Jimbo: Come raid Skinner's house with us.
Kearney: We found a bunch of rancid coleslaw in the dumpster behind
         Krusty Burger.
  Dolph: Yeah, and we're gonna go heave it at his house!
-- Elementary school pranks, 

Nelson is on the verge to give in, but then sees Lisa and decides to
stay.  He goes back to her, taunted by the bullies, who then walk off.
Lisa congratulates him for not using violence, and makes a touched
smile.

It's night, and everyone's asleep.  The auto-dialer, now set on
"redial", calls the Flanders.

  Ned: [sleepy] Howdily-diddely.
Phone: Greetings, friends.  Do you wish to look...
  Ned: [hangs up]  Oh, it's that darn recording again.
Maude: Of course it was.  It's been calling all night.  Just unplug the
       phone.
        [Ned turns out the light -- the phone rings again]
  Ned: Howdily-di...
Phone: Greetings, friends...
        [Ned hangs up]
  Ned: Dang!
Maude: I told you to unplug the phone.
  Ned: But it could be my mother!
        [the phone rings]
       Howdy...
Phone: Greetings, friends...
  Ned: [hangs up]  Shoot!
Maude: That is it, Ned!  If you don't unplug that phone right now,
       you're sleeping on the lawn.
Homer: [outside his window]  Will you two shut up?!  People are trying
       to sleep!
-- 

In the middle of the night, Skinner is awakened by a loud thumping.

Great barrier reef!  We're under attack!
-- Skinner, 

It's the infernal trio, pelting slaw all over his house.  Jimbo
wonders why Nelson is wasting his time with Lisa instead.  "'Cause
your mom had a three-month waiting list." answers the concerned, back
in business.

Skinner: Who's out there?  Give me your names so I can tell the police.
  Agnes: [from upstairs] Seymour, what's going on?  What's that odor?
Skinner: Go back to bed, mother.  I've got it under control.  Listen,
         you crumb bums, if you think I'm impressed, I am not.
          [they fan their bare behinds in front of his window]
Skinner: Ohm brandishing your buttocks is only making me angrier!
  Agnes: I wanna see what's going on!
Skinner: No, mother!  Don't look out the window!
  Agnes: [screams]
-- Never saw a bare butt before, 

Hearing police sirens, the four of them split up and run.

The cops arrive and the gang split up and run off.  Nelson chose
Lisa's house as to hide.  He throws a shoe at a window.

Nelson: Lisa, cops are chasing me!  I need a place to hide!
         [Homer opens his window]
 Homer: Lisa's window is the next one.
-- Caring as always, 

Nelson walks off.  Meanwhile, a phone can be heard.

  Ned: Howd...
Phone: Greetings, friends...
Maude: Ned, did you plug that phone back in?
Homer: Shut up!
-- When you shut up first,

Nelson deceives Lisa and claims he wasn't at Skinner's house and he is
just out to get him.  Lisa meets him at the back door, while Wiggum,
Lou and Eddie burst open the front door.

Wiggum: A-ha!  I had a feeling we'd find you here!
         [shoots]
   Lou: Chief, no!
 Eddie: What'd you do that for?
Wiggum: Well, that thing's been driving the whole town nuts.  Got me out
        of the bath seven times.  Seven!
 Homer: [running down stairs] Hey, who shot the auto-dialer?  [sees
        police] ... Marge's auto-dialer.
Wiggum: See you in court, Simpson.  Oh, and uh, bring that evidence with
        you.  Otherwise, I got no case, and you go scot-free, you know.
-- 

   Lou: Uh, Chief, what about those coleslaw punks?
Wiggum: Well, I... I can't be everywhere at once, Lou, now can I?  You
        know, in most cities, the Chief of Police doesn't even go out on
        calls like these.
 Eddie: Yeah, yeah, we know, Chief.
   Lou: We appreciate it, Chief.
 Eddie: Count our blessings everyday.
   Lou: Yeah we're very appreciative.
-- Did they teach guilt trips at the academy too?,
      

Morning rises and Lisa looks at her house through one of those paying
telescopes at the observatory.  Police cars are scattering up.

  Lisa: I think they're giving up.
Nelson: Thanks for helping me out.  You're a stand-up babe.
-- This means good, right?, 

Nelson points the scope in another direction and watches Skinner clean
up his house.  He shares one eye of the scope with Lisa.

 Nelson: Check it out.  Skinner's mopping the goo off his house!  Wait
         till he finds what I left in his birdbath.
Skinner: Nooooooooooooooooo!
-- Even worse than all you suffered in 'Nam?, 

The quarter is up, and Lisa reminds him he said he wasn't there.  He
tries to backpedal, but finally admits he lied, and then asks for
another kiss.  Lisa realizes she was a fool to think she changed him,
and waves him a goodbye, or "smell you later".

On her walk home, she passes in front of Milhouse's home, who's
outside with his dog.

Milhouse: Hi, Lisa.  Could I talk to you, or would that just make Nelson
          whale on me again?
    Lisa: Don't worry.  Nelson and I don't like each other anymore.
Milhouse: [gasps] Really?  You got anybody in mind for your next crush?
    Lisa: Well, I'm really not thinking about that now.
          [walking away] I suppose it could be almost anybody.
Milhouse: [jumps into the air]  YES!
-- Way to go, you're on the maybe list, 

[End of Act Three.  Time: 21:22]

Over the first portion of the end credits is the auto-dialer, playing
a new tape of Homer's voice.

Hello, this is Homer Simpson, a.k.a. Happy Dude.  The court has ordered
me to call every person in town to apologize for my telemarketing scam.
I'm sorry.  If you can find it in your heart to forgive me, send one
dollar to Sorry Dude, 742 Evergreen Terrace, Springfield.  You have the
power.
-- Anti-scamming the Homer way, 

 EPISODE TITLE: Hurricane Neddy


EPISODE SUMMARY:   {ol}

Homer's lazily taking a mid-afternoon nap in the hammock out on the
lawn. In his sleep, Homer puckers in an attempt to catch his lips onto
the straw inside his lemonade glass sitting on his chest.  Winds begin
to pick up.

Conveniently, Lisa is reading a book about whether when she notices
the strong winds outside her window.  Outside Lisa's window is an
anemometer, a barometer, a hygrometer and other assorted weather
devices.  Lisa looks at what they forecast.

Lisa: Hmm.  Pressure dropping, humidity rising over eighty percent,
      increasing wind?
       [consults "How, Why, and Huh? Book of Weather"]
      Here we are -- chapter two: "So Your Pressure Is Dropping."
-- 

Lisa gasps, learning that these are indications of a hurricane.  She
goes to warn Homer, who is being violently rocked in his hammock as
the wind begins to increase.

Homer: Oh Lisa!  There's no record of a hurricane ever hitting
       Springfield.
 Lisa: Yes, but the records only go back to 1978 when the Hall of
       Records was mysteriously blown away.
-- 

Santa's Little Helper struggles to move forward against the wind.

What is it, boy?  Fire?  Earthquake?  Hippies?
-- Homer reveals mankind's greatest threats,

The wind overpowers SLH and blows him backwards into the air.  Homer
finally realizes this is a hurricane, musing that "Somehow, the
animals are always the first to know."

The family watches news reports about the impending hurricane.

 Kent: ...and the weather service has warned us to brace ourselves for
       the onslaught of Hurricane Barbara.  And if you think naming a
       destructive storm after a woman is sexist, you obviously have
       never seen the gals grabbing for items at a clearance sale.
Marge: [growls] That's true... but he shouldn't say it.
-- 

Lisa suggests to pick up supplies.  At the Kwik-E-Mart, Apu stands
atop the store before the crowd of people.

 Apu: Stand behind the flaming garbage cans.  We'll be letting you into
      the store, seventy people at a time.
Kirk: Oh, let's just beat him up and take his stuff!
 Apu: No no no, do not listen to that man.  Remain calm.  You will all
      have a chance to be gouged.
       [the crowd murmurs in approval]
-- Hurricanes make for excellent extortion opportunities,
      

Sanjay allows for dozens of panicked Springfieldians to enter the
store. Within seconds, they begin clearing the shelves of products.
Kearney looks around nervously while stealing an emergency supply of
squishees. Unfortunately, the mob has left Marge and Lisa with few
items left other than "Creamed Eels," "Corn Nog" and "Wadded Beef."

      Lisa: Mom, let's just grab what we can and get out of here!  This
            storm is making people crazy.
             [two old hands feel around Lisa's spikey hair]
Mrs. Glick: The last pineapple!  And plenty ripe, too!
             [picks up Lisa and puts her in a cart]
      Lisa: But I'm not fruit!  I'm a kid!
Mrs. Glick: That's what the pumpkin said.
     Ralph: Hi, Lisa.  We're going to be in a pie!
-- The legend of Hansel and Gretel lives on, 

Everyone from the Retirement Castle is being evacuated by the National
Guard except stubborn Grampa.

Evacuator: Sir, for your own safety, we do advise you to evacuate.
   Grampa: I ain't leaving!  I was born in this nursing home, and I'll
           die in this nursing home.
Evacuator: Is there any chance of you changing your mind?
   Grampa: Sure, let's go.
-- 

Back at the Simpsons', Bart is securing Maggie's pacifier in her mouth
by wrapping her mouth up in black tape.  Meanwhile, Homer is nailing
the backdoor onto the wall outside when Ned, in a raincoat, spots him.

Ned: Need some help there?  You know, maybe you folks should come over
     and punker in our bunker.
      [Ned's house is covered with tints]
     Oh, it'll be fun!  We're gonna go through our old cancelled checks
     and receipts and give ourselves an audit.  Make sure we don't owe
     anything extra.
-- Who needs the IRS when we have Ned Flanders?, 

Homer: Oh, I'm sure I'd be a third wheel.
  Ned: Ho ho, no sir-ee, we'd be happy as heads to ha...
Homer: [sternly] I would make it my business to be a third wheel.
  Ned: Okily dokily.  Oooh, I better go take down the Manger scene.  If
       baby Jesus got loose, it could really do some damage.
-- Simple hazards for the Flanderses, 

Marge and Lisa have arrived home from the Kwik-E-Mart with groceries.
"Okay, it's the standard Grampa drill.  Everybody into the cellar,"
decrees Homer. The family goes down the cellar.

We see an opening which is similar to "The Simpsons," except "The
Hurricane" is sung out, and those words appear on the screen with grey
clouds behind it.  The letters in the words "The Hurricane" are blown
away by the wind.

The wind blows away a car parked next to an abandoned building.  At
the state prison, a convict is about to die in the electric chair.
Just as the Warden is about to flip the switch, the hurricane blows
off the roof of the prison and the wind picks up the convict into the
air.  "So long, suckers!" he taunts.  The people watching the
execution let out a disappointed "Aww..."  However, the convict's
escape is brief -- as his back hits telephone poll wires,
electrocuting him.  The people cheer.

The hurricane isn't doing much to the Simpsons' house but causing the
window shutters to flap back and forth.  Marge looks through the
cellar window worriedly.

Marge: Why don't we do something to take our minds off the storm?
        [looks through a box]
       Oooh, a Rubik's Cube!  Let's all work it together.
 Lisa: Okay, start with diagonal colors.
        [Marge turns the cube]
Homer: Use your main finger on the yellow side and your other finger on
       the orange side and turn it.
Marge: My main finger?
        [the family begins to start all talking at the same time]
 Bart: [simultaneously] Orange to orange!...
 Lisa: [simultaneously] Now you have to turn it back, Mom...
Homer: [simultaneously] You gotta start backwards!
 Bart: [simultaneously] Mom, Mom!
 Lisa: [simultaneously] No, not so fast!  No, ignore the red!
 Bart: [simultaneously] No, no, no!
Homer: [simultaneously] Alternate corners!
Marge: One at a time!
 Bart: Spin the middle side topwise.  Topwise!
Marge: Now I remember why I put this down here in the first place!
-- Hurricanes bring loving family togetherness, 

The cellar light begins to fade on and off, as the electricity is
affected by the hurricane.

At the harmonica shop, the hurricane wind is causing all the
harmonicas to play (harmoniously, at that).  At the harpsicord shop,
however, the hurricane succeeds only in making harpsicords shoot out
the windows.

The storm dies down, and Homer thinks it's okay to go out, but it
might only the eye of the storm, warns Lisa.  Homer goes out anyway,
assured that the eerie calmness indicates that it's over.  The
Bowl-a-rama floats by in the air.

Hmm.  I don't remember a bowling alley being th...
-- The unspoken warning of disasters, 

Homer tries to dive back into the cellar, but a whirlpool of wind
pulls Homer higher into the air.  Lisa tries to pull him down but
nearly drifts up with him.  Bart and Marge try to get them back down
again, forming a chain which wobbles to the whirlpool.  They finally
pull themselves free and fall back into the cellar.  The whirlpool
disappears, and the storm's power is rekindled.  Marge goes to a box
to pray.

Marge: Dear God, this is Marge Simpson.  If you stop this hurricane and
       save our family, we will be forever grateful -- and recommend you
       to all our friends!  So, if you could find it in your infinite
       wisdom to...
 Lisa: Wait!  Listen, everybody.
        [sunlight shines and birds chip]
 Lisa: The hurricane's over.
Homer: He fell for it!  Way to go, Marge!
-- Don't think God didn't hear that, Homer, 

The family gets out the cellar and see their house appear completely
intact.  "It just goes to show you that everything will work out if
you have faith." remarks Marge.

Ironically, things aren't so bright for Ned, who, donning torned
clothes, walks atop the humungous pile of wood that once belonged to
his now destroyed house.

[End of Act One.  Time: 5:51]

Lisa and Marge visit Ned's destroyed home.

  Ned: Maude?  Rod?  Todd?
 Todd: [upside down; lying on the rubble] I'm right here, Daddy.
Maude: Oh Neddy, it was terrifying.  I thought I was headed for the
       eternal bliss of paradise.
-- And this is a bad thing?, 

 Todd: Oh my gosh!  Look at Rod!
  Rod: [stuck horizontally inside a tree] I have a headache.
        [Ned pulls him out]
  Ned: Well, sir, everyone's alive.  Guess that's something to be
       thankful for.
Homer: Now, that kind of attitude's not gonna get your house back.
-- Yes, only wallowing in self-pity can attain that, 

Marge: I'm sure your insurance will cover the house.
Maude: Uh, well, no.  Neddy doesn't believe in insurance.  He considers
       it a form of gambling.
  Ned: You know it's kind of funny.  The only thing that survived the
       storm were the family tombstones.
        [said tombstones are named Ned, Maude, Rod and Todd]
       They're all we have left.
Homer: Welp, call us if you need anything!
-- Like a house..., 

The Flanderses are the only ones staying at the church's rescue
center, where Rod and Todd sport their hand-out shirts.

Todd: We got new clothes from the donation bin!
      [wearing a Butthole Surfers shirt]  I'm a surfer!
       [Rod wears a t-shirt with "I'm With Stupid" on it and a pointed
       finger]
 Rod: Look, Daddy, Todd is stupid and I'm with him.
      [walks to Maude]  And now Mommy's stupid!  [chuckles]
-- T-shirts help us play!, 

Maude: Neddy, I know this has been a terrible day.  But, by golly, first
       thing tomorrow morning, we're going to open up the Leftorium, and
       before you know it, we'll be back on our feet.
 Kent: [on TV]  Down here at Springfield Mall, a storm-[?] crowd
       appeared to have turned its rage... on the Leftorium.
       Surprisingly, people are grabbing things with both hands,
       suggesting it's not just south-paws in this rampaging mob.
        [Ned sighs]
 Kent: [to looter] Try looking in the back.
-- Kent Brockman's ever-so-important little tidbits, 

Kent: Meantime, Springfield bowlers will be happy to hear that the
      Bowl-a-rama is back in business at its new location teetering over
      the Carter-Nixon tunnel.
       [a strike is bowled in the Bowl-a-Rama]
-- At least Barney still has a job, 

Ned goes to Rev. Lovejoy.

    Ned: Rev. Lovejoy, with all that's happened to us today, I kinda
         feel like Job.
Lovejoy: Well, aren't you being a tad melodramatic, uh, Ned?  Also, I
         believe Job was right-handed.
    Ned: But Reverend, I need to know, is God punishing me?
Lovejoy: Shooh, short answer: "Yes" with an "If," long answer: "No" --
         with a "But."  Uh, if you need additional solace, by the way,
         I've got a copy of something or other by Art Linkletter in my
         office.
-- Jesus' 13th disciple: Art Linkletter, 

At night, everyone is asleep on the rescue center cots, except Ned,
who gets out of bed and walks up to the podium in the church.  He
turns to the good book for advice, but only manages to cut himself on
the edges.

Why me, Lord?  Where have I gone wrong?  I've always been nice to
people. I don't drink or dance or swear.  I've even kept Kosher just to
be on the safe side.  I've done everything the bible says, even the
stuff that contradicts the other stuff.
-- The sounds of Ned's shaken faith, 

The next morning at the rescue center, Marge opens the door with news.

Marge: Ned, Maude!  You've got to go back to your house.  Something
       incredible has happened.
  Ned: Oh what happened now?  Did the rubble burn down?
-- Pessimism becomes you, Ned, 

Marge drives the family back to their neighborhood.  Ned sees the
entire town standing in front of Ned's re-erected house.  Everybody
cheers as the Flanderses get out of the car.

Homer: [in hard-hat and toolbelt] Hope you like it, neighbor.  We didn't
       have the best tools or all the know-how, but we did have a
       wheel-barrel full of love!
  Apu: And a cement-mixer full of hope and some cement.
-- Yeah, that'd do it, 

Ned: I don't know how I can possibly repay you!  But if any of you ever
     need a favor, just look for the happiest man in Springfield!
      [pan over to a spunky man with a perpetual smile on his face in
      suspenders and a red bowtie]
Guy: No no!  Not me, friends.  He's talking about himself.  But thanks
     for looking!
-- 

Ned decides now to go into his house.  He has a little trouble getting
through the door but manages to get in.  The crowd cheers.  Homer
takes Ned into his living room.

  Ned: [gets sweater caught in a nail]  Ooh, looks like a loose nail.
Homer: Yeah, one out of twenty five ain't bad!  [hammers in a nail]
-- 

Homer shows Ned his kitchen, which is "just as you remember it" --
except for one tiny modification: a toilet next to the refrigerator.

   Ned: Was that, uh, was that toilet always next to the refrigerator?
Wiggum: Uh, Ned, you ever try lugging a toilet up a flight of stairs?
-- Toilets and Refrigerators, together at last, 

Rod and Todd's room were designed by Bart and Lisa, replete with a
carpet that doesn't completely cover the floor, a crack in a wall, a
slanted door frame and a "Krusty the Clown" poster.

 Rod: [taking down poster] I don't like this clown!
Bart: Ah, I wouldn't take it down if I were you.  It's a load-bearing
      poster.
       [a crack ripples through the upper wall and up to the ceiling]
-- 

Homer, Apu and Ned walk alongside the uneven walls and five to six
sided doorways.  Static makes Ned's hair stand up and his moustache
hair stick out. The static is coming from the room filled with
electricity.

Apu: This is the room with electricity.  But it has too much
     electricity.  So, I don't know, you might want to wear a hat.
Ned: Uh-huh.  [walks further down the hallway]
     Floor feels a little gritty here.
Moe: Yeah we ran out of floorboards there, so we painted the dirt.
     Pretty clever!
-- Fallback plans from the "Half-Assed Approach to House Erection,"
      

The hallway starts to become extremely narrow and small.

   Ned: Oh, something is definitely wrong with this hallway.
         [opens a 4-inch-tall door]
Barney: Come on in!  It's your master bedroom!
         [Ned shuts the dollhouse-sized door]
        Ow!  My nose!
   Ned: Well, I've seen about enough.
-- 

Outside, Homer concludes the tour: "So, Flanders, what do you think of
the house that love built?"  He pats the front door, which falls
inside the house, causing the second story to cave in.  Finally, the
top story collapses, and the house is back to where it started from.
"Aw shoot!" is his response, scratching his head to find out what went
wrong.

Ned walks away from the demolished "house" and begins to buff his
glasses.  The right lens falls out, and Ned lets out a groan and puts
on his glasses.

   Ned: Calm down, Neddly diddily diddily diddily, doodily.  They did
        their best shodaiddily iddily iddily diddily diddily.  Gotta be
        nice, hostidididildilidilly ah HELL diddily ding dong crap!
        Can't you morons do anything RIGHT!?
         [shocked gasps]
 Marge: Ned!  We meant well, and everyone here tried their best.
   Ned: Well my family and I can't live in good intentions, Marge!  Oh,
        your family's out of control, but we can't blame you, because
        you have gooooooooood intentions!
  Bart: Hey!  Back off, man!
   Ned: Ooh okay, duuuuude!  I wouldn't want you to have a cow, maaaan!
        Here's a catch-phrase you better learn for your adult years:
        "Hey, Buddy, got a quarter?"
         [everyone gasps]
  Bart: I am shocked and appalled.
  Lisa: Mr. Flanders, with all due respect, Bart didn't do anything.
   Ned: Do I hear the sound of butting in?  It's gotta be little Lisa
        Simpson! Springfield's answer to a question NO ONE ASKED!
         [Wiggum laughs]
        What do we have here?  The long, flabby arm of the law!  The
        last case you got to the bottom of was a case of mallowmars!!
Krusty: [writing it down] Mallowmars, oh that's going in the act!
   Ned: Oh, yeah.  The clown, the only one of you buffoons who doesn't
        make me laugh!  [to Lenny]  And as for you, I don't know you but
        I'm sure you're a jerk!
 Lenny: Hey, I've only been here a few minutes!  What's going on?
   Ned: [to Moe] You ugly, hate-filled man!
   Moe: Hey, hey, I may be ugly and hate-filled, but I... um, what was
        the third thing you said?
         [everyone backs away as Ned marches after Homer lastly]
   Ned: Homer, you are the worst human being I have ever met.
 Homer: Hey, I got off pretty easy.
-- 

After concluding his nervous breakdown, Ned walks away in front of the
shocked crowd, gets into his car and drives away.  Once far enough
from all this, he turns on the radio, calmly humming to Aloha Oe.
Reaching his destination, he signals right, and drives through the
gates of the Calmwood Mental Hospital.

[End of Act Two.  Time: 13:42]

  Ned: I just attacked all my friends and neighbors just for trying to
       help me.  I'd like to commit myself.
Nurse: Very well.  Shall I show you to your room, or would you prefer to
       be dragged off kicking and screaming?
  Ned: Ooh, kicking and screaming, please.
Nurse: As you wish.
        [two men in white grab hold of him and drag him away]
  Ned: Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!
-- 

A nurse stops by a padded cell, and is shocked to see Ned's name on
the door.  She quickly makes a phone call.

 Dr. Foster: Yes, Dr. Foster here.  ...  Ned Flanders?  You're sure?
             ...  No, no, no, I'll come right over.  And may God have
             mercy on us all.
              [hangs up]
             Darling, there's an emergency at the hospital, uh, where
             are my shoes?
Mrs. Foster: [sleepily] I think they're in the den.
 Dr. Foster: The den?  May God have mercy on us all.
-- 

Dr. Foster visits Ned in his room.

Dr. Foster: Well, how are you feeling this evening?
       Ned: Uh, actually, I'm a little chilly.  Can I have another strait
            jacket?
-- 

Ned recognizes Dr. Foster, who treated him thirty years ago.  However,
he does not remember the darkest moments of that era.  Dr. Foster
turns out the light and sets up a projector.  The Juvenile Aggression
Study (sponsored by Swanson's TV Dinners) depicts Ned as he really
was: a mischeivous, destructive troublemaker who insults his fellow
playmates in preschool and hassles them.

Little Ned: [barging in]  Whee!  I'm Dick Tracy!  [hitting the other
            kids]  Bang!  Take that Pruneface!  Now I'm Pruneface, take
            that Dick Tracy!  Now I'm Prune Tracy, take that Dick...
Dr. Foster: Hey!  Stop it at once!
-- 

Dr. Foster narrates how Ned's beatnik parents met with Dr. Foster
about their son.  At their meeting, Neddy was smashing up Foster's
diplomas.

Get down from that bookshelf, please. Most of those books haven't been
discredited yet!
-- Dr. Foster, 

Dr. Foster: Would you please tell your son to stop?
 Ned's Dad: We can't do it, man!  That's discipline!  That's like
            tellin' Gene Krupa not to go [starts banging on the desk]
            "boom boom bam bam bam, boom boom bam bam bam, boom boom
            boom bam ba ba ba ba, da boo boo tss!"
-- 

 Ned's Dad: We don't believe in rules, like, we gave them up when we
            started livin' like freaky beatniks!
Dr. Foster: You don't believe in rules, yet you want to control Ned's
            anger.
 Ned's Mom: Yeah.  You gotta help us, Doc.  We've tried nothin' and
            we're all out of ideas.
-- Oh the pain and suffering from doing nothing, 

Dr. Foster decided to put Ned on the "University of Minnesota
Spankological Protocol", which is nothing less than straight spanking
for eight months in line.  As time passes, Dr. Foster's attire changes
to suit the current occasion and season -- while still spanking Little
Ned.  He changes into: a sweater (reading while spanking) during the
Autumn, a Santa Suit during the Winter, a sportsshirt and party hat
for Ned's birthday (Little Ned opens a birthday present), a summer
shirt and shorts during the Summer, and finally back into his coat.

At the end, the treatment worked too well, making Ned unable to
express anger by flooding it under waves of "nonsensical jabbering."
Dr. Foster decides to delve into the heart of the problem, requiring
someone who can upset Ned.  Of course, Homer is called.

Homer: Yello?  ...  Yes?  ...  Mental hospital?  ...  Well I don't know
       any Ned Flanders.
Marge: The man who lived next door until his house blew down?
Homer: Oh, him!
-- How soon we forget, 

The family, wearing "Sane" tags, visits Ned at the mental hospital.

You folks are free to roam the grounds.  Uh, just remember, one of our
patients is a cannibal.  Try to guess which one!  I think you'll be
pleasantly surprised.
-- What do we win if we get eaten?, 

The family tours the mental hospital, waking by cells of Lucille
Botzcowski, a paranoiac patient, and a well-known face.

Jay Sherman: [to Doctor] It stinks!  It stinks!  It stinks!     
     Doctor: Yes, Mr. Sherman.  Everything stinks.
-- One too many Pauly Shore movies for one man to take,
      

Dr. Foster leaves Ned in a booth by himself, the other reserved for
someone needed to be so irritating that Ned will not be able to
repress his anger. Homer is obnoxiously blowing a bubble of bubble gum
in Dr. Foster's face. "Homer, can you be that annoying?"  The bubble
explodes and gum is all over Foster's face, proving he can be.

Dr. Foster, joined by another doctor, sit behind a two-way mirror,
observing Homer's interaction with Ned.  The sliding partition reveals
Homer to Ned. Homer emotionlessly says what is written in his speech
cards.

 Homer: Ned Flanders, I mock your value system.  You also appear foolish
        to the eyes of others.
   Ned: Well howdy, Homer!  [partition slides up]  Ooh, thanks for
        dropping by!
Foster: Hmm.  He's not responding.  [into microphone] Proceed to level 2
        antagonism.
         [slides down partition]
 Homer: Past instances in which I professed to like you were fraudulent.
   Ned: Oh, well, I'll just have to try harder.  Heh heh.  [partition
        slides up]  Ooh!  Thanks for dropping by!
Foster: Ah, he's still repressing.  [into microphone] Maximum hostility
        factor.
         [slide down partition]
 Homer: I engaged in intercourse with your spouse or significant other.
        Now that's psychiatry!  Eh?  Eh?
-- Freud would be proud, 

Ned thinks it's a joke, and Homer throws in the towel.

 Homer: [directly towards mirror]  Aw that's it, you just can't insult
        this guy.  You call him a moron and he just sits there, grinning
        moronly.
   Ned: [to mirror]  Hi, neighbor!
 Homer: You know what your problem is, Flanders?  You're afraid to be
        human.
   Ned: Ho ho, now why would I be afraid of that?
 Homer: Because humans are obnoxious, sometimes.  Humans hate things.
   Ned: Well, maybe a few of them do... back East.
Foster: I can't find what Homer's saying.  Did you write that?
Doctor: Um, did you like it?
-- At least this is more effective, 

Homer: Come on, Flanders, there's gotta be something you hate.  What
       about mosquito bites?
  Ned: Mmm mmm!  Sure are fun to scratch!  Mmm!  Satisfying!
Homer: What about, uhhhhh, florescent lights?
  Ned: Oooh, they hum like angels!  You're never lonely if you've got a
       florescent light!
-- Oh, I give up, 

Homer is about to give up, but Ned admits he doesn't like
everything.

   Ned: I don't like the service at the post office.  You know, it's all
        "rush rush!  get'cha in, get'cha out!"  Then they've got those
        machines in the lobby, they're even faster, no help there. You
        might even say, I hate the post office.
        That, and my parents.  Lousy beatniks.
        [sudden breakthrough sound] Hey!  That felt good.
Foster: He just said he hates his parents!  Do you know what that means?
Doctor: Um, what do you think?
Foster: It means he's cured.
Doctor: That's what I said.
-- The Nick Riviera method works again, 

Ned's released from the hospital in front of a cheering crowd.

   Ned: Thanks, everyone!  I'm all better now.  No more storing up the
        anger till I explode.  If any of you does something I don't
        like, yo-ou're gonna hear about it!
         [crowd cheers]
Foster: Yes, that's very healthy, Ned.
   Ned: [omnious]  And if you really tick me off, I'm gonna run you down
        with my car.
         [clapping dies down dramatically and everyone looks worried]
 Homer: Heh heh!  Ned, you so craz-ay!
         [Ned winks]
-- You're not just whistling Dixie, Homer, 

[End of Act Three.  Time: 21:27]

 EPISODE TITLE: El Viaje Misterioso de Nuestro Homer


EPISODE SUMMARY:   {dga}

It's breakfast time in the Simpson household.  While the children eat,
Homer is discarding sections from that morning's Springfield Shopper.

Oh, why do they have to put all of this crud in my newspaper.
[tosses sections aside]  "World."  "The Arts."  "Religion."
Ah-ha!  Here it is: "Kickin' Back."
-- Homer's vision of a newspaper, 

Homer opens the paper, but there's a gaping hole in the first page.

Homer: Hey, who cut something out of my paper?
        [Homer stares suspiciously through the newspaper hole at his
        wife and children]
 Lisa: Not me.
 Bart: Not me.  I'm more of a mail-tamperer.
Marge: Don't look at me.  Just because I'm holding a pair of scissors.
        [Homer frowns]
       Scissors which I need to, uh, to... gussy up these curtains.
        [she half-heartedly trims the curtains, grinning sheepishly at
        her husband.]
-- 

Somewhat later, Homer is sitting on the couch with Marge, who's
repairing her early damage to the curtains.  The phone rings.

Homer: Yello?  Oh, hi, Lenny.
        [Marge reacts with alarm]
       No, why would I need a ride this afternoon?
        [Marge begins to vacuum next to Homer.  He is forced to yell.]
       Where?  To the big annual what?
        [Marge pounds at the telephone plug with the vacuum.  Finally
        the plug comes out of the wall]
       Lenny?  Aw, well, if it was big and annual, I'm sure they'd have
       mentioned it in the newspaper.
-- Homer's specious reasoning, 

That afternoon, Homer wastes his time by playing with the dog.

Yeah, it's a lazy dog-dangling afternoon...
-- Attica, Attica, Attica!  

Homer somehow senses that something is a little "off."  He then
notices Marge smoking.

Well, I just fell like filling the house with the rich satisfying smell
of tobacco.
-- Marge, our new spokeperson, 

Marge takes a puff and blows it right in Homer's face.  He concludes
that she's nuts, and goes to get some fresh air, but Marge tries to
hold him back.

Homer: What's wrong with you?  What are you trying to hide from me...
       [Homer opens the door and sniffs]  What's that smell?  Onions...
       chili powder... cumin... juicy ground chuck?  It's chili!  Oh, my
       god, I'm missing the chili cook-off!  [whining, fidgeting] I'm
       missing the cook-off, it's going on right now, and I'm missing 
       it.
Marge: All right, I was trying to keep it from you, but I had a good
       reason.  Every time you go to that cook-off you get drunk as a
       poet on payday.
-- As drunk as James Dickey?  

Marge asks him to remember last year.  In a flashback, we see an
obviously drunk Homer, a Duff in each hand, standing in the cotton-
candy machine.  "Look at me...I'm a puffy pink cloud." he mumbles,
before he climbs out of the machine and lies on the ground, where dogs
lick at him.

Back to the present.  Homer is shuffling around in the closet.

Homer: Well of course, everything looks bad if you remember it.  Now
       where are my chili boots?
       [finds them in the closet] Ah!
-- Somehow I'm not reassured, 

Marge: Okay, we'll go to the chili cook-off, but I want you to promise 
       that you won't have any beer.
Homer: [trying to pull his boots on]  Okay, quit nagging me, I won't
       have any beer.  Sheesh, why don't you have a cigarette or 
       something?
Marge: Mm, I suppose I could.
-- You've come a long way, baby, 

Our favorite family arrives at the cook-off, where Homer anxiously
urges his wife and children on.

Lisa: I'm gonna go get some vegetarian chili before they get desperate
      and add meat.
Bart: I'm gonna go claim some valuables at the lost-and-found.
-- 

Meanwhile, Marge finds items more of her interest at "A Little Bit of
Lenny", a stand selling craft items.

Marge: Oh, look at that adorable spice rack!  Eight spices?  Some must
       be doubles.  Ore-GAH-no?  What the hell?
Homer: Marge, we're missing the chili.  Less artsy, more fartsy.
Marge: Homer, I happen to like handicrafts much more than stuffing my 
       face.
Homer: Fine, I'll come find you when I'm ready to stop having fun.
Marge: Remember your promise: no drinking.
        [they walk apart]
Homer: [sotto voce] Stupor-pooper...
-- 

Marge wanders over to a large dancing floor, where Ferl Dixon and the
Second Helping Boys are playing.

  Helen: Howdy howdy, Marge and Home... oh, my mistake.  Homer's not
         even with you.  Probably just knocking back a few
         "refreshments."  [chuckles]
  Marge: Thank you for your concern, Helen.  Homer isn't drinking today.
  Helen: Oh!  I think it's lovely that he said that.  And that you 
	 believed him.
Lovejoy: Now, Helen, let us not glory in Homer's binge-drinking.  There 
	 but for the grace of God goes Marge herself.
-- 

As Ennio Morricone-esque music plays, Homer visits the cook-off
proper.  People gasp as he approaches and brandishes a wooden spoon.

They say he carved it himself... from a bigger spoon.
-- Lenny narrates the spoon legend,
      

Homer steps up to "Firehouse Ned's Five-Alarm Chili."

Homer: Five-alarm chili, eh?
  Ned: Uh-huh.
Homer: [eats some]  One, two... hey, what's the big idea?
  Ned: Oh, I admit it.  It's only two-alarm, two-and-a-half, tops.  I 
       just wanted to be a big man in front of the kids.
 Todd: Daddy?  Are you going to jail?
  Ned: We'll see, son.  We'll see.
-- 

As Marge watches the dancing, a gaudily-dressed Waylon Smithers
approaches her.

Smithers: Evenin', little lady.  You reckon a square could get a dance?
   Marge: [sighs]  It looks so complicated.  Do you know how?
Smithers: Ma'am, I wouldn't honk the honk if I couldn't tonk the tonk.
-- Whatever that means for his reputation,
      

Smithers then pulls at his bola tie, lighting up a neon "Hot Nashville
Nights" sign on his back.  Marge is impressed.

Back to the Cook-Off.  Homer samples the bill of fare at "Moe's Chili
Bar". "A bland, timid entry, suitable, perhaps, for patients
recovering from surgery" is his verdict, much to Moe's disappointment.

Homer walks off, in search of another victim.  Chief Wiggum, at his
own stand, observes.

That Simpson, he thinks he's the pope of chili town.
-- Wiggum, 

Surrounded by speared skulls and other various occult items, Wiggum
puts on welding mask and gloves, and proceeds to stir a boiling
mixture. Homer steps in front of him, on the theme from "The Good, The
Bad, and The Ugly".

Wiggum: Afternoon, Homer.  Care for some chili?  I've added an extra 
        ingredient just for you.  [dramatic]  The merciless peppers of
        Quetzlzacatenango!  [exhibits a glowing pepper]
         [crowd gasps]
        Grown deep in the jungle primeval by the inmates of a Guatemalan
        insane asylum.  [drops the pepper back in the pot]
         [crowds observes in silence]
 Homer: Uh, Wiggy?  My chili's getting cold.
-- A fistful of chilis, 

Everyone holds his breath as Homer nonchalantly picks a pepper from
Wiggum's chili.  However, the pepper sears his tongue on the slightest
contact.  Homer screams frantically, much to the crowd's amusement.

He grabs an ice-cream cone from a little girl; wnfortunately, the ice
cream melts before it actually touches his tongue.  He is finally
about to down six mugs of beer simultaneously, when Marge sees him,
and sternly reminds him of his promise.

Later, Homer is reduced to slaking his thirst with water.  While
complaining about his defeat, he absent-mindedly grabs a candle.

Ralph: Wait, mister, you're drinking a candle.  You don't want to get 
       wax in your mouth, do you?
Homer: [slyly] Maybe I do, son.  Maybe I do.
        [Homer chugs the candle, and spits out a stream of wax, which
        solidifies on the spot]
       Outstanding!
-- A man, a plan, a candle, 

Homer reapproaches Wiggum's booth, his tongue now sealed in wax.

Wiggum: Hey, everybody, look who's back.  It's the biiig baby.  
	[childlike] Oh, dis porridge is too hot!  Oh, wah-wah-wah!  
         [crowd laughs, but Homer hands his spoon in silence]
        Want some more, do you?  Well, sure!  Heck, it's not my job to
        talk people out of killing themselves.
-- Bad cops, bad cops, 

To everyone's surprise, Homer quickly downs the pepper, and asks for
more.  Wiggum fearfully hands him two more peppers, which follow the
first one as rapidly.

 Quimby: Good lord, this can't be happening!
Hibbert: By all medical logic, steam should be shooting out of his ears.
 Krusty: His ears, if we're lucky.
-- Chili as seen on Road Runner, 

Showing off, Homer gulps down a last one, and bows in front of his
audience.

Well, Chief, don't quit your day job...  Whatever that is.
-- Homer, 

The crowd laughs and applauds, as Homer walks away in triumph.
Savoring the moment, his regret is that Marge wasn't there to see it.
However, his attention is quickly drawn to his stomach, which emits a
loud rumble.  He walks around in pain, searching for help.

 Flanders: Well, sure, buddy, I'd be happy to help out. What can I 
	   [Ned's visage begins changing as Homer hallucinates] do-
	   diddily-doodily-diddly-hobbily-hibbily-gobbily-gobbily-
           gobble-gabba-gabba-hey.
            [Homer screams and falls.  He then sees everyone else as
            caricatures of their normal selves]
   Jasper: Goo Goo Ga-Joob?
   Nelson: [parrot-like] Ha-HAW!  Ha-HAW!
Krabappel: [muted trumpet sounds]
   Barney: [incredible belch]
-- And so it begins, 

Homer screams and runs away, crashing through a wooden fence.

Ralph: Hey, Mister, do you need some help?
 Otto: Let him go, Ralph.  He knows what he's doing.
        [Homer screams bewilderedly]
-- I wouldn't bet on it, 

[End of Act I.  Time: 8:19]

In Paul McCartney's words, Homer "went into a dream."  Homer
hyperventilates as his skin flows like some kind of liquid as he
stands in front of a psychedelic cloudscape.

Okay, retrace your steps.  Woke up, fought with Marge, ate Guatemalan 
insanity peppers, then I...  Oh...
-- Homer's daily regimen, 
       
The rapidly morphing landscape plays hell with Homer's perspective.
Thinking that he's in Shelbyville, he is divebombed by a giant,
garishly colored butterfly.

Man, this is crazy.  I hope I didn't brain my damage.  
-- Who would notice?  

Homer's facial features sink into his head and pop out the other side.
He decides to check his pupils in a nearby stream.  His pupils are
doing downright odd things.  Suddenly, the stream turns into a giant
snake which coils around Homer and hisses at him.  He decides that
he's going to be leaving.  As he walks towards the horizon, the sun
moves up.  As he steps back, the sun goes down.  He likes this, and
does it several times in a row until the sun hits the ground and
shatters.  Homer screams.

Note to self: stop doing anything.
-- Good advice, 

Meanwhile, in the real world, Marge stands by the exit of the
cook-off, looking for her husband.

  Marge: Has anyone seen Homer?
  Helen: Marge, better you should hear it from me than from some gossipy
         neighbor.  Homer made a total jackass of himself.
Lovejoy: Helen, that's enough.  Call off your dogs.
  Helen: But someone had to tell her.  [sulking] And I got here first!
-- Gossip used for good, not evil?,
      

Growls Marge "No beer, huh?  I guess I know what a promise from Homer
J. Simpson is worth."

Back in his chili trip, Homer is spelling out "HELP" with rocks.  One
of the rocks crawls away, however.

Hey, buddy!  Get back there with the other rocks!
-- Homer's attempt to domesticate rocks,
      

Homer is surprised to see that it is a (non-kinky) tortoise.  As the
tortoise crawls, he leaves a message in the dirt.

Homer: [reading]  "Follow the..."
       [gasps]  This must be why I'm here!  Follow the what?  Follow the
       what?  Hurry up!
        [the message reads: "Follow the tortoise"]
       D'oh!  [that words forms in clouds of dust]
-- Yet, better than a snail, 

Homer frantically follows the tortoise, which is moving far too slow
to suit him.  "When I'm kicking you, that means hurry up!"  He then
punts the reptile an incredible distance.  Homer follows it, taking
increasingly greater strides, finally coming to a tiny Aztec-style
pyramid.  The tortoise points to it.

Homer: Oh, you want me to climb that, huh?  No problemo.
        [before Homer can climb it, the ground rumbles and the pyramid
        grows to several times its original size]
       [groans]  This is 'cause I kicked you, isn't it?
        [the tortoise nods in assent]
-- Stupid poetic justice, 

Back to the real world, the Simpsons are driving home.  Bart is
wearing a "Time for Chili" hat.

Bart: Lis, check it out.  Time for chili.
Lisa: [bored] I saw it, Bart.
Bart: You're just mad 'cause there's no clock in your hat.
Lisa: What hat?
Bart: Pff.  Ah, this baby's wasted on an idiot like you.  
-- 
 
 Bart: Where's Homer?
Marge: [through clenched teeth] Your father decided he'd rather come
       home in a taxi.  [to herself] Or a police car.
-- 

In his fantasy world, Homer, gasping, finishes climbing the pyramid.
On top, he sees Marge with her back to him.  He tries to get her to
look at him, running circles around her at one point, but he never
sees her face.  "Fight fair, I never do this to you" he argues.
Suddenly, a strong wind blows her away as she turns into a fine
powder.

Homer cannot stand this place anymore, wondering what he's doing there
anyway.  "You are on a quest for knowledge" replies a disembodied
voice.

Homer looks up in the sky, where the moon turns into a giant eye.  A
saturn-like planet floats down next to the eye and turns into another
eye.  Then, the rest of a smiling canine face appears in the sky.  The
face liquifies and then materializes as an entire coyote on the
pyramid next to Homer.

Coyote: Fear not, Homer.  I am your spirit guide.
 Homer: [warily] Hiya.
Coyote: There is a lesson you must learn.
 Homer: If it's about laying off the insanity peppers, I'm way ahead of 
	you.
-- That's more than he usually learns,
      

Coyote: I speak of a deeper wisdom.  The problem, Homer, is that the 
        mind is always chattering away with a thousand thoughts at once.
 Homer: Yeah, that's me all right.  [Homer has a glazed look in his eyes
        as the wind blows his two hair strands.]
-- Yeah, right, 

Coyote: Clarity is the path to inner peace.
 Homer: Well, what should I do?  Should I meditate?  Should I get rid of
        all my possessions?
Coyote: [snorts]  Are you kidding?  If anything, you should get more
        possessions.  You don't even have a computer.
-- Inner peace through silicon circuitry,
      

 Homer: You know, I have been meaning to take a spiritual journey, and I
        would...  [the coyote is chewing his pant leg]  Hey! Knock it
        off!  [kicks him]
Coyote: [sheepishly]  Sorry.  I am a coyote.
-- 

Look, just give me some inner peace, or I'll mop the floor with you.
-- Homer bargains a cheap price to his inner peace,
      

The coyote instructs Homer to find his soulmate: the one with whom he
shares a profound mystical understanding.  Homer thinks it is Marge,
but the coyote, running off, makes him doubt himself.  Homer then sees
a ghost train which runs over him...

...returning us to the real world, where Homer is hit on the head with
a golf ball.  Kent Brockman calls security to get him off the course.

Homer: Huh?  Golf course?  Did I dream that whole thing?  Maybe the
       desert was just this sand trap.  Oh, and I bet that crazy pyramid
       was just the pro shop.
        [the pro shop is on top of a giant pyramid, as well]
       And that talking coyote was really just a talking dog.
  Dog: Hi, Homer.  Find your soulmate.
Homer: Hey, wait a minute!  There's no such thing as a talking dog!
  Dog: [barks]
Homer: Damn straight!
-- Couldn't be more convincing myself,
      

Bart and Lisa are in the kitchen.

 Bart: ...so then I says to Mabel, I says...
        [Homer walks in]
Homer: Hi, kids!
 Bart: I'll finish this later.  Hi, Dad.
Homer: Where's your mother?
 Lisa: Out back.
        [Homer walks out]
 Bart: So anyway, I says to Mabel, I says...
-- 

In the backyard, Marge is putting the laundry out to dry with her back
to him.  Her back stiffens when she hears her husband.

Homer: Oh-ho.  I guess you're cranky 'cause I didn't come home last
       night.
Marge: I'm "cranky" because my husband got drunk and humiliated me in
       front of the entire town.  You broke your promise, Homer.
Homer: Oh, honey, I didn't get drunk, I just went to a strange fantasy 
       world.
-- Probably prepared his argument with Lionel Hutz,
      

Homer points out that Marge should believe him, being his soulmate.
However, that's the last thing she wants to hear.

That night, Marge is sleeping alone upstairs, while Homer paces by the
couch, wondering if Marge really is his soulmate.

Homer: We don't have anything in common.
        [opens the record cabinet, with "Marge" and "Homer" sections]
       Look at these records: Jim Nabors, Glen Campbell, the Doodletown
       Pipers.  Now look at her records!  They stink!
-- Compared to...?, 

Outside, Homer concludes that his soulmate is not to be found there,
and walks away, dejected.

[End of Act II.  Time: 15:37]

Homer is laying on a sofa, speaking to a seated, well-dressed man.

Homer: I always just figured my wife was my soulmate.  But if it's not
       Marge, then who is it?  Where do I begin looking?
  Man: This really goes beyond my training as a furniture salesman, sir.
       Now if you don't want the sofa, I'll have to ask you to leave.
-- 

Homer goes to Moe's.  He buys Barney a beer, calling him "soulmate,"
but Barney says that he's "really more of a chum," not his soulmate.
Lenny describes himself as a "croonie"; Carl, a "acquintance"; Larry,
a "collegue"; Sam, a "sympathizer"; Bumblebee Man, a "compadre";
Kearney, an "associate"; and Hibbert, a "contemporary".

I'm a well-wisher, in that I don't wish you any specific harm.
-- Moe, on his relationship to Homer, 
	

Homer tries to find his soulmate via a pay phone...

Hello?  Is this... [reads his paper] GBM?  Uh, yeah.  I read in the
personals that you were seeking a soulmate.  Well, I also like rainy
days and movies.  Uh-huh...  [apprehensively] Uh, no, I don't like
that...  Or that...  No, it's not that I'm afraid.  [very quickly] I'm
going to hang up now, bye-bye.
-- Homer, unfamiliar with personals,
      
	
 Homer: Oh, I give up.
Coyote: [voiceover] Find your soulmate, Homer.  Find your soulmate.
 Homer: Where?  Where?
Coyote: This is just your memory.  I can't give you any new information.
-- Thank you for calling, 

Homer wanders through Springfield as Janis Ian's "At Seventeen" plays.
Searching for his soulmate, he rushes into Mayor Quimby's campaign
headquarters, under the banner "Your Best Friend in Government".  He
is promptly kicked out.

Next, in front of a pet shop, he is solaced by watching a pair of
"kissing fish," but his admiration turns into horror when one fish
opens his mouth, swallowing the other, and then turns to Homer with a
malicious look.

Homer's long wanderings continue.  Even the Community Outreach office
turns him down.  Finally, he ends up on the waterfront, where he sees
a bright light.  It's the lighthouse!  Homer decides that the
lighthouse keeper, "the loneliest man in the world," must be his
soulmate.  He rushes to the lighthouse, and getting swallowed by a
wave in the process.

The lighthouse sign says it is operated by Earl.  Homer rushes in.
"Here I come, buddy!  No more loneliness for Homer and Earl!"  But his
joy ends abruptly when he steps into the main room, occupied by the
Electronic Automatic Robotic Lighthouse.

Homer: A machine?!  Earl's a machine?!
       [sarcastic] Oh, that's just perfect!  Homer's desperate search
       for a soulmate has yielded a lighthouse-keeping robot.  Oh, wow.
-- Bad luck, 

Homer's silhouette is projected by the lighthouse, making him visible
to all Springfield, including his own children, who are brushing their
teeth.

Bart: Hey look!  Is that dad?
Lisa: Either that, or Batman's really let himself go.
-- You mean he looks like Adam West?  
      

Back in the lighthouse, Homer continues to feel sorry for himself.

I'm a lonely, insignificant speck on a has-been planet orbited by a
cold, indifferent sun.
-- Copernicus still has some followers,
      

His moaning is interrupted by a ship's horn heard in the distance. In
his desperate search, Homer decides to bring the ship to him, and
throws a fire extinguisher into the light.

The ship is commanded, of course, by Captain McAllister.

McAllister: Arr, matey.  Nary a warning light to be seen.  'Tis clear
	    sailing ahead for our precious cargo.
    Sailor: Uh, would that be the hot pants, sir?
McAllister: Aye, the hot pants.
-- Precious to whom, I wonder, 

In the lighthouse, creepy music plays while Homer giggles insanely.
Suddenly, we hear footsteps, and the door opening.  It's Marge, who
was worried when she woke up and Homer was gone.

Homer: But how did you find me?
Marge: Well, I was sure you'd be on foot, because you always say public 
       transportation is for losers.  And I was sure you'd head west, 
       because Springfield slopes down that way.  And then, I saw the 
       lighthouse, and I remembered how you love blinking lights.  Like 
       the one on the waffle iron.
Homer: Or that little guy on the "Don't Walk" sign.
-- Nothing like bright, shiny things, 
      

Homer: Wow, Marge, you really do understand me.  See, I thought we 
       weren't soulmates because...
Marge: ...we had a fight?
Homer: Right, and we don't like the same things.  It's like you're from 
       Venus...
Marge: ...and you're from Mars.
Homer: [resentfully] Oh, sure, give me the one with all the monsters.
-- Venus Attacks!  

Homer realizes that he and Marge really do have a profound mystical
understanding.

Homer: Oh, Marge!  [chanting] We're number one!  We're number one!  In 
       your face, space coyote!
Marge: [sotto voce] Space coyote?  
-- 

Homer's triumph is short-lived when he hears the ship coming near.
They realize they have to get the light back on.  Marge checks the
utility closet for spare bulbs.  After throwing away an empty box, she
carries a new bulb up the ladder, and successfully installs it.

McAllister: Jonathan Livingston Seagull!  We're on a collision course!  
	    Hard a-starboard!
    Sailor: [just checking] Uh, port?
McAllister: [quietly] Aye, port.
-- 

The ship gives the lighthouse a wide berth.  The soulmates kiss
passionately.

Meanwhile, the ship has missed the lighthouse, but has run aground on
some other rocks, tossing the precious cargo into the water.  Chief
Wiggum and a crowd of others examine the flotsam.

Wiggum: Look at all them hot pants.
 Lenny: Hey, who likes short shorts?
 Crowd: [chanting] We like short shorts!
-- Just checking, 

The credits go up over a silhouette of Marge and Homer kissing. "Short
Shorts" plays as the credits roll.

[End of Act III.  Time: 21:23]

 EPISODE TITLE: The Springfield Files


EPISODE SUMMARY:   {ol}

In a dark study, Leonard Nimoy sits at a desk that has a skull, a book
and three lit candles on it.  Behind him is a bookshelf.  A spotlight
fades in on him.

Hello.  I'm Leonard Nimoy.  The following tale of alien encounters is
true.  And by true, I mean false.  It's all lies. But they're
entertaining lies.  And in the end, isn't that the real truth?  The
answer is: No.
-- What was the question again?, 

"Our story begins on a Friday morning in a little town called
Springfield." Nimoy narrates.  In his book is an illustration of a
glad-looking Homer, which takes us into the story.  At the SNPP, Homer
is celebrating the fact that it's Friday, and that he's off to Moe's.
Lenny reminds him that it's 10am, but Homer has a plan of his own to
sneak out of work.

I saw this in a movie about a bus that had to speed around the city,
keeping its speed over fifty.  And if its speed dropped, the bus
would explode!  I think it was called... "The bus that couldn't slow
down."
-- So close, yet so far, Homer, 

Homer carries out his plan.  He hooks up his VCR to the surveillance
camera and puts in an ancient cassette tape of him working with Lenny
and Carl in sector 7-G.  The result: an infinite loop of Homer, eating
a doughnut while talking to Lenny, both dressed in 70's clothing.  In
comes afro-wearing Carl in a hippie outfit.  A glitch in the tape
skips to another shot of Lenny and Carl dancing while Homer sleeps.
The awkward loop of this 5-second tape goes unnoticed by Mr. Burns,
who chats with Smithers in his office.

Mr. Burns: So, another Friday is upon us.  What will you be doing,
           Smithers?  Something gay, no doubt!
 Smithers: Wha...?  What?!
Mr. Burns: You know.  Light-hearted, fancy-free.  "Mothers, lock up your
           daughters!  Smithers is on the town!"  [chuckles a bit]
 Smithers: Exactly, sir!  [laughs nervously]
-- Gotta be more careful there, Waylon, 

At the Retirement Castle...

    Jasper: Thank God it's Wednesday.  [eats pills]
Mrs. Glick: It's Friday.  [eats pills]
    Japser: Uh-oh, wrong pills.
             [hair grows all over his body]
            Uh...  Little help?
-- God bless today's medicine, 

At the Noiseland Arcade, Donkey Kong sits in a chair on top a stand
holding a sign saying "Meet Donkey Kong in Person."  The Generic
Sarcastic Middle-Aged Worker walks by, saying he's "just not a draw
anymore."  Kong replies by throwing him a barrel.  "Hey!  He's still
got it!" observes the man.

At the arcade, Milhouse feeds the "Waterworld" video game the fourty
quarters required to play the game.

Milhouse: [feeding quarters] 38... 39... 40 quarters.  This better be
          good.
           [presses start, walks two steps]
    Game: Game Over.  Please deposit 40 quarters.
Milhouse: What a rip!
           [hesitates a second, then deposits more quarters]
-- I bet he's seen the movie 32 times, 

"Thank god it's Friday," says Dr. Hibbert, leaving and closing the
hospital. Inside is a naked Hans Moleman standing behind an x-ray
screen, left to himself.

Later, a decorative living room is displayed -- but it's only in the
"Better Homes Than Yours" magazine.  It's lying on a filthy table,
whose garbage is being picked up by Marge, who surveys the filthy
house.

Marge: [sees SLH chewing on a chair]  Bad dog!
       [sees Snowball scratching up the couch]  Bad cat!
       [sees a fawn licking something]  Bad fawn!
       [looks puzzled]
-- Bad moose, and squirrel, and elephant and three-toed sloth...,
      

Marge shoos away the fawn.  Meanwhile, Bart and Lisa are watching TV.

Lisa: All right!  It's time for ABC's "TGIF" lineup!
Bart: Lis, when you get a little older, you'll learn that Friday is just
      another day between NBC's "Must See Thursday" and CBS' " Saturday
      night craporama."
-- And Fox Sunday nights fit in where?, 

At Moe's, Homer's in the mood for more excitement than his regular
Duff. Quick thinker, Moe draws two dots above the "u", and voila:
"Doof," direct from Sweden.  "Skoal!" shouts Homer, but he's not
fooled for long.

Moe draws back and offers him a real new brand: "Red Tick Beer."

Homer: Hmm... Bold, refreshing, and something I can't quite put my
       finger on.
        [at the Red Tick Beer brewery, dogs are swimming in the tank]
  Man: [takes a sip]  Hmm... Needs more dog.
-- Homer tries Red Tick Beer, 

After downing quite a few...

Well, it's 1am.  Better go home and spend some quality time with the
kids.
-- Homer sets the new standard for family togetherness,
      

But Moe won't let him go till he takes a breathalyzer test.  Homer
takes it, and he's not just Tipsy, not just Soused, not just Stinkin',
but he's in the "Boris Yeltsin" level of drunkenness.  "Eh, I guess
I'll walk home" reasons Homer.

Homer wanders around and winds up in a dark, scary park full of
leafless trees.  Homer's startled by the howling dogs.  Suddenly,
"Psycho" music starts to play as a bus pulls up, its headlights
glaring at Homer.  The chilling violin is being played by the musical
passengers aboard the "Springfied Philharmonic" bus.  The bus speeds
off, dropping off a lone violinist, who continues to play the eerie
music.

Terrified, Homer starts to aimlessly run.  He stops before a billboard
that says "DIE."  Homer shreaks.  The wind blows away the tree that
covered the last word.  Nonetheless, a "DIET" sign still scares Homer
witless.  Homer runs into the woods and runs into Grampa, who was
hiding in the bushes.

Grampa: Oh son, I'm glad to see you!  I went for the morning paper and I
        got lost!  And...
 Homer: No time for you, old man!
         [pushes Grampa aside]
-- Don't interrupt a man in the middle of a cowardice panic,
      

Homer plows through a mess of branches and plants and runs across a
log in the middle of the misty night.  For effect, an owl hoots. Homer
trips over a branch.  (For more effect, the chilling music most
associated with "The X-Files" begins to play)  What he sees before him
is an eerie, green glowing figure with a large bulbous head, enormous
dark eyes and a contorted, spindly body.

Homer: Please!  Don't hurt me!
Alien: [gentle voice] Don't be afraid.
Homer: Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!!!
        [begins running through the field of grass, creating a
        handwritten writing of "Yahhh!" in the grass]
-- Your typical alien encounter, 

[End of Act One.  Time: 5:21]

Homer busts through the door of his bedroom, panting, awakening Marge.

Marge: Homer, it's 2 am.  What happened?
Homer: It was an alien, Marge!  It appeared in front of me and said
       "Don't be Afraid."
Marge: [waving her hand in front her nose]  Have you been drinking?
Homer: No!  Well, ten beers.
-- Ticks'll do that to you, 

Homer tells his unbelieveable tale at the breakfast table.

Homer: I'm telling you, I saw a creature from another planet.
 Lisa: Maybe you just dreamed it.
Homer: Oh yeah?  Well, when I came to, I was covered with a sticky,
       translucent goo.  Explain that!
Marge: [serves him] More sausage?
        [Homer starts drooling]
-- Occam's Razor to its gruesomest, 

 Lisa: Dad, according to "Junior Skeptic Magazine," the chances are 175
       million to one of another form of life actually coming in contact
       with ours.
Homer: So?
 Lisa: It's just that the people who claim they've seen aliens are
       always pathetic low-lifes with boring jobs.  Oh, and you, Dad.
       [nervous laugh]
-- Once a skeptic, always a skeptic, 

Bart, "The Thing, from Uranus," greets the family dressed in novelty
spring goggles, a bike helmet with antennaes on top and a black shirt
while holding a water soaker, making light of Homer's supposed alien
encounter.

Homer: [gasps, then realizes] Oh, it's Bart.  I can't believe it.  I'm
       being mocked.  By my own children.  On my birthday.
 Bart: It's your birthday?
Homer: Yes!  Remember, it's the same day as the dog's.
 Lisa: Santa's Little Helper, it's your birthday?  Ooh!  We've gotta get
       you a present.  [cuddling him]  Yes we do!  Yes we do!
 Bart: [cuddling him]  We love you boy.
Marge: [cuddling him]  Good doggie.  Good doggie.
        [Maggie joins in, leaving Homer alone at the table]
Homer: Lousy loveable dog.
-- Yet with an untwistable stomach, 

Homer tells his unbelieveable tale at the SNPP.

Oh, it was awful!  They set me on a cold, metal table.  Then prodded me
with humiliating probes, and then...  Oh wait, that was my physical.
-- From `The X Files' to `General Hospital', 

At the police station, Homer tells his unbelieveable tale to Chief
Wiggum.

 Homer: The alien has a sweet, heavenly voice... like Urkel!  And he
        appears every Friday night... like Urkel!
Wiggum: Well, your story is very compelling, Mr. Jackass, I mean, uh,
        Simpson.  So, I'll just type it up on my invisible typewriter!
         [Wiggum raises his arms and starts typing on air in sarcasm]
         [starts humming]
 Homer: You don't have to humiliate me.
         [Homer walks off, and another man walks in, wearing slightly
         burned clothes and playing compulsively with a lighter]
   Man: I just torched a building downtown, and I'm afraid I'll do it
        again!
Wiggum: Oh, yeah, right.  I'll just type it up on my invisible
        typewriter!
         [goes through the same sarcastic routine]
        Fruitcake!
-- Why do you wear that badge, anyway? 

We are then taken to the F.B.I. Division of Paranormal Activites.
Inside the office, there is a picture of J. Edgar Hoover in a lady's
dress, joined by other spooky pictures.  An attractive red-head is
working at her computer.  Her attractive, brown-haired partner shows
her a paper about Homer's alleged alien encounter.

Mulder: There's been another unsubstantiated UFO sighting in the
        Heartland of America.  We've gotta get there right away.
Scully: Well... gee, Mulder, there's also this report of a shipment of
        drugs and illegal weapons coming into New Jersey tonight.
Mulder: [scoffs] I hardly think the FBI is concerned with matters like
        that.
-- That's for overpaid, obese policemen with invisible typewriters,
      

At the Simpsons home, Mulder gives a slight knock on the front door.
Marge answers, and panics at the sight of F.B.I. agents, thinking
they're after her for the pen she took from the Post Office.  Swearing
she didn't know it was in her purse, and that she was about to bring
it back when the dog chewed it up, she starts hyperventilating. Mulder
informs her that their matter is with Homer.  Still panting, Marge
greets them in.

At the FBI Springfield Branch, Mulder and Scully tell Homer to pick
out from a lineup the alien that he saw.  But Marvin the Martian,
Gort, Chewbacca, ALF and Kang (or is it Kodos?) don't fit the bill.

Oh, this makes me very angry!
-- Marvin, the clicheic, Martian, 

The Cigarette Smoking Man in the shadows watches Mulder and Scully
conduct a polygraph test on Homer.

Scully: Now, we're going to run a few tests.  This is a simple lie
        detector.  I'll ask you a few yes or no questions and you just
        answer truthfully.  Do you understand?
 Homer: Yes.
         [the polygraph explodes]
-- It worked, all right, 

Scully tests Homer's reflexes.  It takes quite a while before Homer
feels the pain and says "Oww."

Later, with wires attached to him, Homer runs on a treadmill in naught
but his underwear.  Mulder and Scully watch.

Mulder: Wait a minute, Scully.  What's the point of this test?
Scully: No point.  I just thought he could stand to lose a little
        weight.
Mulder: His jiggling is almost hypnotic.
Scully: Yes.  It's like a lava lamp.
-- 

Mulder amd Skully then take their investigation to Moe's.

Mulder: All right, Homer.  We want you to re-create your every move the
        night you saw this alien.
 Homer: Well, the evening began at the gentleman's club, where we were
        discussing Wittgenstein over a game of backgammon.
Scully: Mr. Simpson, it's a felony to lie to the F.B.I.
 Homer: We were sitting in Barney's car eating packets of mustard.  You
        happy?
-- 

Homer later makes himself as drunk as he was before and begins to make
a pass at Scully.

You are one fine looking woman, lady.  If I wasn't married, I'd go out
with you like that!
 [hits his bottle on the bar; beer bubbles and spills out the bottle]
I am so sorry!  Whatever you do, don't tell Marge!  God, I love her!
I... hey!  A penny!
 [leaps into the floor]
-- Homer recreates his every move (and bottle), 

Scully and Mulder introduce themselves to Moe at his request, and
their FBI credentials alarm Moe, who orders the men in the backroom
watering a disgruntled killer whale to take him back to Sea World.

Homer, meanwhile, continues to waste the bored FBI agents' time.

So, I says, blue M&amp;M, red M&amp;M, they all wind up the same color in the
end.
-- Homer's answers to life's greatest mysteries, 

Scully invites Homer to lead them to his next location on the night of
his encounter.  The three wind up in the park.  Homer points to the
woods where the creature emerged; just at that moment, there's
rustling in a bush.  All gasp, and Scully cocks a gun, fearing the
worst.  To their (somewhat) relief, Grampa emerges in his tattered
clothes.

Grampa: For the love of god, help me!  I've been here for four days and
        that turtle's got all of my teeth!
        [looking down]  There he is!
         [the turtle walks away, holding the oversized denture]
Grampa: [running as slowly as the turtle]  Come back here, you!  Slow
        down!  I'll get you!
Scully: This is the worst assignment we've ever had.
Mulder: Worse than the time we were attacked by the flesh-eating virus?
Grampa: [gets bitten by the turtle]  Oww!  It bit me with my own teeth!
Scully: No, this is much more irritating.
-- 

Scully decides she's seen enough, and leaves.  Mulder's about to
follow, but stops to deliver a speech.

But somewhere out there, something is watching us.  There are alien
forces acting in ways we can't perceive.  Are we alone in the universe?
Impossible.  When you consider the wonders that exist all around us...
 [it's nighttime now, and everyone's left Mulder alone in the park]
...voodoo priests of Haiti, the Tibetan numerologists of Appalachia, the
unsolved mysteries of -- "Unsolved Mysteries."  The truth is out there.
-- Mulder, as skeptic as we know him, 

Behind him, Moe and the two men are hauling away the killer whale.

Oh, who thought a whale could be so heavy?!  [sees Mulder]  Cheese it!
The feds!
-- Moe, 

Homer talks to Marge in bed.

Homer: Oh Marge, I never felt so alone.  No one believes me.  [pause]
       Uh, this is the part where you're suppose to say "I Believe You,
       Homer"?
Marge: I don't believe you, Homer.
Homer: You do??  Oh, Marge, you've made me so happy!
Marge: Hmm, you're not listening.  You're only hearing what you wanna
       hear.
Homer: Thanks!  I'd love an omelette right about now.
-- 

Marge tries to wake him up.

Marge: I try to be supportive, but this has gone too far!  Please, just
       let it be?
Homer: No, I can't.  This is my cause.  I'm like the man who
       singlehandedly built the rocket and went to the moon.  What was
       his name?  Apollo Creed?
-- How long before he cries `Adrienne!', 

Insulted by Marge's lack of trust for him, Homer leaves the bedroom,
and sulks at the breakfast table.  Bart comes in.

 Bart: Hey, Dad.  What's the word with Planet Crackpot?
Homer: Oh, I suppose you're going to mock me, too!
 Bart: Well, actually, Dad... I believe you.
Homer: You do?
 Bart: Yes, I do.  You seem so damn sure.
Homer: Thank you, son.  And do you think you can stop the casual
       swearing?
 Bart: Hell yes.
Homer: That's my boy.
-- Darn right, 

Homer: This Friday, we're going back to the woods and we're going to
       find that alien!
 Bart: What if we don't?
Homer: We'll fake it, and sell it to the Fox network.
 Bart: [chuckles]  They'll buy anything.
Homer: Now, son, they do a lot of quality programming, too.
        [the two bust up laughing]
       I kill me.
-- Make sure there's no wristwatch this time, 

Out in the woods --again-- the three "Budweizer" frogs get eaten by a
crocodile, who grunts "Coors."  Not far away, Bart and Homer camp out
with an assortment of Ned Flanders' belongings.

 Bart: Hey, Dad, can I have a sip of your beer?
Homer: Now, son, you don't want to drink beer.  That's for daddies and
       kids with fake IDs.
-- 

Homer suggests a ghost story instead.  Later that night, lit with a
flashlight, Bart completes his chilling tale: "...and that is how much
college will cost for Maggie."  Homer screams in denial.

Later, Homer and Bart roast up some marshmallows, enjoying the great
time they're having together.

That "X-Files" music starts up again, and the green glow floats
through the trees.  Homer recognizes his encounter.

Alien: I bring you peace.
Homer: As a representative of the planet Earth, let me just say [gets
       his foot in the camp fire]  Baaaaaaaaaaaaaah!  Aaaaaaaaaaaagh!
       [tries to beat out the fire]  Oww!!  Oww!!
-- And we really mean it, 

The alien runs away in fear.  Homer mourns his lost proof, but Bart
cheers him up by saying he's taped the whole thing.  Homer and Bart
jump up and down in joy, their jumping frozen into an illustration
that takes us back to Leonard Nimoy in the study.

   Nimoy: And so, from this simple man came the proof that we are not
          alone in the universe.  I'm Leonard Nimoy.  Good night.
Teenager: [off-camera]  Uh, Mr. Nimoy, we have ten minutes left.
   Nimoy: Oh.  Uh, fine.  Let me, uh, just get something out of my car.
          [runs off]
          [starts his car and drives off]
Teenager: I don't think he's coming back.
-- You're quick, 

[End of Act Two.  Time: 14:52]

Kent: Tonight, on Eyewitness News: a man who's been in a coma for 23
      years wakes up.
 Man: Do Sonny and Cher still have that stupid show?
Kent: No, uh, she won an Oscar, and he's a Congressman.
 Man: Good night!
       [turns over and dies]
-- The right choice, 

But first, E.T., phone Homer -- Simpson, that is.  Local man, Homer
Simpson, shown here with his tongue stuck to a lamppost, has given us
this videotape.
-- Those damn file photos..., 

They show a few seconds of his video, which Kent dubs as Close
encounter of the blurred kind."

The alien has appeared in the same Springfield pasture the past two
Friday nights.  Will it appear again this Friday?  The entire Channel 6
news team will be there, except for Bill, the boom mike operator, who's
getting fired tomorrow.
 [boom mic falls and hits Kent in the head]
Very unprofessional, Bill.
-- The sorrows of the underappreciated boom mic operator,
      

Lisa still isn't convinced, and thinks there must be a more logical
explanation and doubts the town will buy the story based on the tape.
The doorbell rings.  Homer answers the door and the questions of the
rabble of believers.

Hibbert: Is the alien carbon-based, or silicone-based?
  Homer: Uhhh... the second one.  Zillifone.  Next question?
 Barney: [drunk]  Is the alien Santa Claus?
  Homer: Uh... yes!
    Ned: Uh, where you on my roof last night stealing my weather vane?
  Homer: This interview is over!  [goes in, slams the door]
          [said weather vane falls on the "Welcome" mat]
-- And your tabletray, and camping equipment and camcorder...,
      

That Sunday, Lovejoy bases his sermon on Homer's encounter.

I remember another gentle visitor from the heavens.  He came in peace,
and then died, only to come back to life.  And his name was... E.T., the
extraterrestrial.  [sniffs]  I love that little guy.
-- Lovejoy reads from Spielberg's bible, 

Later, that Friday night, the town sets up a fiasco filled with music
and t-shirt sales in anticipation of the alien's third visit.  Mr.
Largo gets a five-member band to practice the "Close Encounters"
theme, Jimbo tries to get tickets to Pearl Jam, and Leonard Nimoy's
getting a hot dog.

 Bart: Leonard Nimoy?  What are you doing here?
Nimoy: Wherever there is mystery and the unexplained, cosmic forces
       shall draw me near.
 Bart: [flippantly] Uh-huh.
  Man: Hey Spock, what do you want on your hot dog?
Nimoy: Surprise me.
        [the hot dog man hesitates, then puts a whole batch of what
        appears to be lettuce on top]
-- The surprise is what comes after you eat the hot dog,
      

Homer tries to prove to Lisa that he's being respected because there
are "Homer was Right" t-shirts being sold, instead of "Homer is a
Dope" t-shirts, which, in actuality, were sold out in five minutes.
"D'oh!" Even Maggie and Marge are wearing those.

Homer: Marge, how could you??
Marge: These shirts are a hundred percent cotton.  And look at the fine
       stitching on "dope".
Homer: I'll take two.
-- Proving the shirts' point, 

Clouds gather, the eerie music starts and the green glowing alien
returns.  The entire town is flabbergasted, and Marge apologises to
Homer for doubting him.

  Alien: I bring you love!
Hibbert: [smoking a cigar]  Is that the love between a man and a woman
         or the love of a man for a fine Cuban cigar?  [chuckles]
  Alien: Uh... I bring you love!
  Lenny: It's bringing love!  Don't let it get away!
   Carl: Break its legs!
-- Love, the harbinger of destruction, 

The town suddenly gets an array of weaponry and start trying to attack
the alien to capture him.  Lisa stops them by turning a flashlight on
the alien, revealing it to actually be Mr. Burns.

   Burns: Hello, children!  I bring you love!
   Willy: Aah!  It's a monster!  Kill it!  Kill it!
Smithers: It's not a monster!  It's Mr. Burns!
   WIlly: [tender] Aw, it's Mr. Burns.  [raging] Kill it! Kill it!
-- What's the difference?, 

Smithers urges them to hear his explanation for it all.  This is all
the result of medical procedures designed to help Mr. Burns cheat
death for another week, including an extensive chiropractic
readjustment, eyedrops (which enlarge Mr. Burns' pupils), pain killers
and a vocal chord scraping.

Don't worry.  You won't feel a thing.  [exhibiting a swirling mechanical
device]  Till I jam this down your throat!
-- Nick Riviera, 

"The whole ordeal leaves Mr. Burns twisted and disoriented" explains
Smithers.  Mr. Burns wanders out the hospital and off into the woods,
where he's later seen beaming a green glow.

The most rewarding part was when he gave me my money.
-- Nick Riviera, 

 Bart: But, what's with the glowing?
Burns: Um, I'll field that question.  A lifetime of working in a nuclear
       power plant has given me a healthy green glow.  [to himself]  And
       left me as impotent as a Nevada boxing commissioner.
       And now that I'm back to normal, I don't bring you peace and
       love.  I bring you fear, famine, pestilence and...
 Nick: [shooting Burns with a needle of painkiller] Time for a booster!
        [Burns reverts back to his alien-like state]
Burns: [singing] Good morning, starshine.  The Earth says hello.

Nimoy joins in, and soon all of Springfield -- with Mulder, Scully and
Chewbacca -- is waving together, singing "Good Morning Sunshine."
They raise their arms in the air, and the picture is yet again frozen
in Nemoy's book, now narrated by the Generic Teenager.

And so concludes our tale.  I'm Leonard Nimoy.  Good night, and keep
watching the skis.  Uh, skies.
-- Our favorite pimple-faced teenager of all, 

Eerie "X-files music" closes the show.

[End of Act Three.  Time: 21:20]

 EPISODE TITLE: The Twisted World of Marge Simpson


EPISODE SUMMARY:   {ol}

At the Municipal House of Pancakes, a meeting is held for the
Springfield Investorettes, composed of Maude Flanders, Luanne Van
Houten, Agnes Skinner, Helen Lovejoy, Edna Krabappel and Marge.

They say the pancakes here stink.
-- Agnes Skinner at the Municipal House of Pancakes,
      

Helen has a chart set up while explaining how their shares in Dynaflux
Unimatics are up a "delicious seven and three quarters," meaning their
investment club portfolio has nearly doubled in value.  Helen's
suggestion: use their profits to invest into high-risk ventures.

 Edna: Oh!  Oh!  How about Oklasoft?  It's Oklahoma's fastest-growing
       software company.
Maude: Um, cushions?  Everybody likes to sit on cushions.
Agnes: Children are so fat today.  [pounds her fist on the table]
       Isn't there some way we could make money off that?
-- 

Helen points out that a franchise fair is held that weekend, and
proposes to buy a business.  Everybody murmurs in agreement, but Marge
is reticent to the idea.

I'm not wild about these high-risk ventures.  They sound a little risky.
-- Marge's views on business, 

Everybody glares at her, complaining about how she always objects to
risky investments, yet getting her share of the profits.

Helen: All in favor of expelling Marge from the Investorettes?
  All: [raising hands]  Aye!
Marge: [gets up]  All right, Helen.  If I'm not wanted I'll leave.
Helen: You'll get your pancakes in the mail.
-- Better not invest in mayo then, 

At the dinner table, Marge glumly explains what took place that
morning at the pancake house.

Marge: [sighs] ...and then they gave me back my $500 investment and
       kicked me out of the club.
Homer: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Back up a bit now.  When are the
       pancakes coming in the mail?
Marge: Well, maybe it's all for the best.
Homer: What do you need to make money for, anyway?  As long as I have my
       earning power, this family's got nothing to worry about.
       [stabs his eye with a hot dog]
       Oww!  Ohh!  Call work and tell 'em I won't be in tomorrow.
-- 

Listening to Lisa's advice to "roll the dice", Marge decides to beat
those girls at their own game, and buy her own franchise.

The next weekend at the Franchise Expo, visitors are greeted by a
wiggling robot, holding money bags in its arms and standing in front
of the entrance.

Robot: Greetings, humans.  I am Investo the robot, from the planet
       Opportuniac.  My superior brain advises you to enter the
       Franchise Fair.
Marge: Well, we're trying to but you're blocking our way.
Robot: Danger!  Danger!  Don't forget to pick up pamphlets.
 Bart: I'll handle this.  [pours his cola into the robot's vents]
        [the robot writhes and collapses on the floor]
        [Bart whistles and walks around it, followed by the family]
Robot: [in a distorted voice]  Help.  Help.  Help.  Security code 30.
-- That'll teach all of ya robots, 

The family walks to what seems to be the hosting show of the expo.

Royce: That's the miracle of the franchise.  You get all the equipment
       and know-how you need, plus a familiar brand-name people trust.
       You'll be on a rocket-ride to the moon!  And while you're there,
       would you pick up some of that nice, green moon money for me --
       Royce McCutcheon!
Homer: No deal, McCutcheon, that moon money is mine!
-- Make moon money fast!, 

Marge goes to the "Picture Perfect" seminar.

 Host: Now, folks, I don't wanna alarm ya, but scientists say forty
       percent of America's pictures... are hanging crooked.
        [the audience gasp in shock]
       Yep, it's true.  And I hear you asking: "Well, who's gonna
       straighten out all these artistic abominations?"  Your friends?
       A neighbor?   Those fat cats at Washington?  [chuckles]  Good
       luck.  Hey, you know, maybe no one'll notice!  Maybe the problem
       with ju-u-u-st fix itself.
Marge: Now you're the one who's being naive.
  Man: Okay.  Fair enough.  But you sound like you're ready to become
       your own boss in the exciting world of frame-nudging!  Yes, for
       a minimal franchise fee, you'll receive a pair of straightening
       gloves, a cannister of wall lubricant and a booklet of the most
       commonly asked questions you will hear, including: "Who are you?"
       and "What are you doing here?"
-- Wow... frame-nudging!, 

Marge realizes she doesn't have any desire to own a business, and
wonders what she's doing there in the first place.  As she turns
around, she comes face to face with her former business partners.

Marge: Hello, Helen.
Helen: Marge.
Marge: Edna.
 Edna: Marge.
Marge: Uh...  [Agnes glares]  Hmm...
Agnes: [irritated]  Oh, my name is Agnes and you know it's Agnes!  It
       means lamb -- lamb of God.
Marge: I'm sorry, Agnes.
Agnes: Marge.
        [the Investorettes walk away]
-- The greatest confrontation ever seen,
      

Driven by anger and revenge, Marge turns back right away in search of
the right business.

Meanwhile, at Disco Stu's "Can't Stop the Learnin' Disco Academies"...

Disco Stu: [making indescribable body motions]  Did you know that disco
           record sales were up 400/ for the year ending 1976?  If these
           trends continue...  A-y-y-y!
            [kicks his feet up on his desk wearing see-through platforms
            with water and fish inside]
    Homer: Uh, your fish are dead.
Disco Stu: Yeah, I know.  I... can't get them out of there.
-- See you in the last decade, 

The Investorettes visit the Fleet-A-Pita franchise.

  Helen: Hmm, Pita.  Well, I don't know about food from the Middle East.
         Isn't that whole area a little iffy?
Hostess: [laughs]  Hey, I'm no geographer.  You and I -- why don't we
         call it pocket bread, huh?
  Maude: [reading the ingredients list]  Umm, what's tahini?
Hostess: Flavor sauce.
   Edna: And falafel?
Hostess: Crunch patties.
  Helen: So, we'd be selling foreign...
Hostess: Specialty foods.  Here, try a Ben Franklin.
  Helen: [takes a bite]  Mmm, that is good. What's in it?
   Chef: [poking his head out of a window, looking of Indian origin]
         Tabbouleh and rezmi-kabob.
Hostess: [trying to cover-up]  Uh, th-that's our chef... Christopher.
   Chef: [mutters, and closes the window, cursing in Hindi]
-- You guys aren't from around here, are you?,
      

The girls gather around and start eating pitas, looking ready to buy
the franchise.  Nearby, Marge glooms.

Look at them!  They've jumped on the one franchise I might possibly have
considered thinking about becoming interested in.
-- Oh, that's a downer, Marge, 

Marge concludes she simply isn't cut out for the world of business.
Next to her, the owner of the Pretzel Wagon booth observes that she
sounds like "the old me, which was ironically, the young me."  Marge
walks in, somehow sympathizing with him.

The man tells that he was once like Marge and the others, "lost in a
sea of flashy gimmicks and empty promises", until "God tossed me a
life preserver.  A tasty, golden brown life preserver."  He flashes a
pretzel, and offers it to Marge.

Marge: Hmm! It's not bad!
Frank: It's not only not bad -- it's not bread.  "Knot bread", you get
       it?  [chuckles]  See?
Marge: [laughing]  I do!
        [they both laugh]
Marge: Knot bread!
-- The usual pretzel-people jokes, 

Their laughter is interrupted by a bugle playing a fanfare.

Hostess: Let's hear it for the newest members of the Fleet-A-Pita
         franchise!
          [Patti LaBelle's "New Attitude" plays, as the members walk
          through a Fleet-A-Pita paper wall]
         Maude!  Helen!  Agnes!  Luanne!  Edna!  Bart!
   Bart: Whoo!  We're number one!  We're number one!
          [a guard grabs his collar and drags him along]
   Bart: Hey, what's going on?  [protesting]  Wait, wait, hey...
-- Bart gets dragged away from a club he doesn't belong in,
      

After this last straw, Marge inquires about the cost of a pretzel
franchise.  The answer is coincidentally $500, which she produces
right away.

Frank: Congratulations, and welcome to the dynamic world of mobile
       pretzel retailing.
Marge: When can I start?  Where's my territory?
Frank: Your... territory.  Well, lemme tell ya.  Wherever a young mother
       is ignorant of what to feed her baby, you'll be there.  Wherever
       nacho penetration is less than total, you'll be there.  Wherever
       a Bavarian is not quite full, you will be there.
Marge: Don't forget fat people.  They can't stop eating!
Homer: [passing by the stand]  Hey, pretzels!
-- 

[End of Act One.  Time: 7:00]

Back in her kitchen, Marge pops a "Pretzel Wagon" videocassette guide
in a VCR.  What we see is a bland office, while Frank sets up his
camera. He then walks to his desk, fumbles through some papers, and
performs the overused "I didn't hear you coming" act -- miserably.

Hello.  I'm Frank Ormand, and if you're watching me, that means you've
got pretzel fever -- and not the kind that attacked my intestinal lining
some years back.  [starts a sickening laughter]  So let's get your
franchise up and running.
-- America's funniest pretzel videos,
      

The family gets in on Marge's business as they follow Frank's
instructions.

"Start by setting up an office in your basement or garage" is the
first direction; Marge sets up the (again) cliche "Hang in there,
baby!" poster with a cat hanging from a clothes-line.

"An automatic garage door opener makes you feel like you're working in
a futuristic wonderworld."  Homer puts the door to use by stutting it
down in front of Ned.

"Next, blanket your community with flyers.  A phony ticker-tape parade
will help you avoid littering laws."  Bart and Marge take care of the
pamphlets, while Homer rides in the streets with Lisa in the back
seat, wearing some crazy Martian helmet.  The whole town cheers.

Welcome back, space girl!  [wipes a tear]
-- Chief Wiggum's emotional cry, 

The video continues...

Frank: Now you're ready to make pretzels.  Open your bag of
       ingredients...  [does so, to find bugs inside]
       Urgh.  Check for -- millipedes.  Erghh.
-- Less millipedes and your intestinal lining might've remained okay,
      

Hours later, the kitchen is a total mess, and on the center table lies
a batch of pretzels.  Bart and Lisa anxiously watch Homer, who's
wearing his safety hat and badge from work with "Official Pretzel
Inspector" written on it, checking a pretzel with a micrometer.  The
inspector gives his approval, and the kids exchange high-fours.

The first target of the new Pretzel Wagon is the power plant; when
Marge honks outside, Homer paves the way for pretzel madness.

Homer: Hey, what's all that commotion outside?  Why, it's one of those
       pretzel wagons the movie stars are always talking about.
Lenny: [gasps]  Here?  Our plant?
Homer: That's right, Lenny.  Let's all give in to deliciousness -- the
       Pretzel Wagon way!
        [everybody cheers]
Homer: [among the commotion]  Yeah!  Homer's right!
-- The perfect setup, 

The whole plant rushes out to get pretzels, and Lisa rejoices at the
sight of so many potent customers.  Once Marge has reminded everyone
to put on their hairnets, they're all set for their first transaction.

Marge: Welcome to Pretzel Wagon.  May I take your order?
Lenny: [hesitating] Uh, let's see.  I'll have... one, uh...
 Carl: Hey, hurry up.  I wanna get my pretzel.
Lenny: One pretzel.
Marge: Thank you.
 Carl: [now in front of the line]  Uh, let's see, um...  I will have one
       of your, uh...
Burns: Come on, come on, while we're young.
-- We are?!, 

Carl's hesitation is put to a halt by a nearby honking, that of the
Fleet-A-Pita van which pulls up in the plant's parking lot.

Lenny: Wow, check out that van!  It looks like it doesn't even need
       out business.
 Carl: Hey, let's go!
-- Looks like your average customer to me,
      

Soon enough, the pretzel line becomes the pita line, much to Marge's
dismay.  She goes to have a talk to her competitors.

Marge: Excuse me.  I had this spot first.
 Edna: Sorry dear, just business.  Ha!
Marge: Well, I guess Macy's and Gimbels learned to live side by side.
Agnes: Gimbels is gone, Marge, long gone.  You're Gimbels.
-- 

Figuring the power plant isn't the only good location in town, Marge
decides to literally take her business elsewhere.

Along one of their runs, the Pretzel Wagon drives by Cletus' house.

Cletus: [waving]  Hey slow down!  I wants to talk to you!
         [Homer stops the car]
Cletus: Give us three hundred pretzels.
 Marge: [to Homer] You see?  A little persistence and patience paid off!
        [to Cletus] That'll be three hundred dollars.
Cletus: Hey I don't think so.  I got me three hundred coupons.
         [Cletus hands an armful of coupons to Marge]
 Marge: [growls] I should've said "Limit: one per customer."
Cletus: Should'a but didn't so hand 'em over.  Hey!  Kids!  We're eatin'
        dinner tonight!
-- Learning business the hard way, 

Cletus then yells for his kids as they walk one by one out of his
shack, and puts on a huge smile afterwards.  Marge lets out a
depressed growl.

Back in her garage-office, Marge needs a serious confidence boost.

Marge: [reading the poster] "Hang in there, baby!"  You said it, kitty.
       [looking more closely] "Copryright 1968."  Hmm, determined or
       not, that cat must be long dead.  That's kind of a downer.
-- That's one depressing way of looking at a citations dictionary,
      

Lisa walks in, and tells Marge to think big, and set up her business
at a major public event.  Marge's choice lays on the Springfield War
Memorial baseball Stadium, where she holds Free Pretzel Day.

  Marge: Here you go!  Free Pretzel Wagon pretzels for everyone.  One
         bite and you'll be hooked!
Skinner: [takes one] Thank you!
  Pedro: [takes one] Gracias!
  Homer: [whispering] That means "thank you," Marge!
-- Your own pocket dictionary, 

Just as everyone is slowly about to munch in those delicious pretzels
(oh, the suspense!), the announcer reveals the winner's name of
today's giveaway.  The 1997 Pontiac Astrowagon goes to the fan in seat
0001 -- C. Montgomery Burns.  No one's happy about this but Mr. Burns
and Smithers, and Mr. Burns hops in his new car, which is pelted by
the pretzels thrown by the angry, booing crowd.

Announcer #1: And here come the pretzels!
       Marge: Oh, no!  No, don't do that!  You're suppose to be
              tasting them!
Announcer #2: Hall of Famer Whitey Ford now on the field pleading with
              the crowd for... for some kind of sanity.
Announcer #1: Uh-oh, and a barrage of pretzels now knocking Whitey
              unconscious.
Announcer #2: Wow.  This is uh...  This is a black day for baseball.
-- Remembered throughout history, 

In the kitchen, Bart and Homer try to cheer up a much depressed Marge.

 Bart: Cheer up, Mom.  You can't buy publicity like that.  Thousands and
       thousands of people saw your pretzels injuring Whitey Ford!
Homer: You could call them Whitey-Whackers.
-- Buy one and get a chance to knock Whitey yourself!,
      

But they don't succeed, and Marge sinks into self-depreciation -- and
butter.  Homer can't stand to see his wife like this.

Marge needs help... and God knows I'm not the man to provide it.  But I
know who can.
-- Ah, that's close enough, Homer, 

Homer floors it and drives to Frank Ormand's dreamy, candyland-style
house.  "It looks like Mr. Pretzel-Man is doing pretty well for
himself" comments Homer, before ringing to the door.  A woman in black
answers.

Homer: I'm here to see Mr. Ormand.
Woman: Of course.  Right this way.
        [in the living room is held Ormand's funerals]
Homer: Oh, I guess I should speak to the executor of his estate.
Woman: [whispering] He's right over there. [points to another coffin]
       They were in the same car.
-- 

As many have done before, Homer seeks for his last hope at church.

Homer: I've never reached to you before but my wife is in her hour of
       need.  Your help could make all the difference in the world.
 Tony: Okay.
Louie: See boss?  I told you that as in the church bulletin would pay
       off.
-- 

[End of Act Two.  Time: 13:41]

The following morning, at 5:30am, Marge answers the phone, still
sleepy.

Marge: No.  Pretzel Wagon's no longer...  300 pretzels?!  Wait!  Wait!
       Let me get this down.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Meat Packer's Union
       Hall, Batavia, New York.  I'll send them right out!
-- Don't you smell a fish?, 

She wakes up Homer, who fakes the surprise when hearing that she's
back in business.

Out on the streets, Fat Tony and his boys are busy eliminating
competition by destroying Hans Moleman's Hot Dog cart and the buns
therein.  Meanwhile, Marge is counting money and making more and more
pretzels.  The orders keep coming in.  Legs is at Luigi's, destroying
Luigi's pizzas.  Fat Tony's mob has ordered girl scouts (at gunpoint)
outside the county line.  Marge, meantime, is getting rich.

Marge answers a choiceless order for pretzels by Principal Skinner for
the Springfield Elementary cafeteria.

  Marge: Are you sure the children will get enough nutrition from these
         pretzels?
Skinner: [robotic tone] Yes, I am sure.  Sure as sure can be.
          [uses his injured right hand to give Marge her money]
  Marge: Oh my god.  What happened to your fingers?
   Thug: [from inside the room] Boating accident...
Skinner: I believe it was a boking accident.
          [from behind, a targeting beam aims for his head]
         I have to go now.
-- Can't get enough of those gulp yummy pretzels,
      

Helen is angrily asking the police why the boat isn't unloading the
Fleet-a-Pita falafel fixins.

 Helen: I don't understand why they won't unload our falafel fixings.
   Lou: Ship's impounded, Ma'am.
Wiggum: Yeah, we, uh, found a couple of barnacles on the hull; that and,
        uh, the deck was, uh, wet.
-- Fear from the wet decks!, 

 Helen: That's crazy!  And what are those men doing under my van?
         [the men flee the van]
Wiggum: Look, lady, if I was you, I would just leap into the air as I am
        preparing to do.
         [they both leap and the van explodes]
-- Pretzel Wagon's business is, uh, exploding,
      "The Twisted Tales of Marge Simpson"

That night at Moe's, Homer pays his beer with a fifty, and goes to the
washroom to wash his hands.

 Tony: [clearing his throat]  Greetings, Homer.
Homer: Hey!  Fat Tony!  You still with the mafia?  [walks away]
 Tony: Uh...  Uh, yes, I am.  [holds him back]  Thank you for asking.
       Now, Homer, as you no doubt recall, you were done a favor by our,
       uh, how shall I say -- Mafia Crime Syndicate.
Homer: Oh, yeah...
 Tony: Now the time has come for you to do us a favor.
Homer: [shocked] You mean the mob only did me a favor to get something
       in return?  Oh, Fat Tony!  I will say good day to you, sir!
       [folds his arms in disgust]
-- What's the world coming to?, 

Tony leaves, then realizes.

Later, Marge does another delivery -- down an uninhabited desert road.
She consults her map.

Well, here I am -- 11905 Dead Weasel Road.  I don't see any apartment
building.
-- You SURE you don't smell a fish, Marge?,
      

At that point, her car gets knocked off the road by Fat Tony's limo.

Marge: Hey! Wh-what's going on?!
        [Fat Tony walks to the car, and tries to take the keys -- but
        they won't come off]
 Tony: Is, uh, there a button or a release for these keys?
Marge: Oh.  Oh, you have to push in as you turn.
 Tony: Ah.  [does so]
Marge: Yeah, that's it.
-- Cooperative key tips, 

Fat Tony introduces himself as a business partner, and claims he is
intitled to a part of Marge's profits -- just around 100%.

You have 24 hours to give us our money.  And to show you we're
serious... you have 12 hours.
-- Mafia practices, 

Marge immediately sees Homer about the mess made.

Marge: Homer!  Did you tell the mafia they could eliminate my
       competitors with savage beatings and attempted murder?
Homer: [swallowing beer] In those words? ... Yes.
-- 

I saw your pouring your heart and soul into this business and getting
nowhere.  I saw you desperately trying to cram one more salty treat into
America's already bloated snack hole.  So I did what I could.  I did
what any loving husband would do!  I reached out to some violent
mobsters.
-- Loving husbands like Homer, unite!,
      

Marge appreciates the gesture, but refuses to share her own profits
with the mafia.  Homer inquires about what they can do.  "We're going
to do what we do everyday.  We're going to make pretzels!" Marge
replies.

The next morning, Marge attempts to carry on with her business while
Homer looks out the kitchen window for trouble.  She salts the last
pretzel, and they stare at the clock like nervous wrecks.  The door
knocks, and they yell.

Grampa: [in boxers]  I had that dream again...
 Homer: Oh, thank God, it's only Grampa.  [slams door]
-- 

The door knocks again.  This time, it ain't Grampa.

 Tony: Sorry we're late.  Could we have the money now?
Marge: The answer -- is no.
 Tony: I'm afraid I must insist.  You see, my wife, she has been most
       vocal on the subject of the pretzel monies.  "Where's the money?"
       "When are you going to get the money?" "Why aren't you getting
       the money now?" And so on.
-- Kind of like a broken record of the Macarena,
      

The answer is still no, and Marge and Homer brace themselves for the
consequences when the scene is interrupted by the angry Investorettes.

 Edna: Well, well, if it isn't Marge Simpson and her gangland cronies.
Maude: Your goon squads certainly gave you the edge in the mobile snack
       business.  But I'm afraid we've outdone you once again.  Hiroshi,
       Yukio...
        [steps aside to reveal a group of armed Japanese]
       Perhaps you've heard of the Yakuza -- the Poison Fists of the
       Pacific Rim -- the Japanese mafia.
Agnes: They'll kill ya five times before you hit the ground!
-- 

The two groups step forward, and soon the Simpsons field is the
theater of punches and flying ninja stars.

Marge: Homie, maybe we should go inside.
Homer: But, Marge, that little guy hasn't done anything yet.  Look at
       him.  [the man in white suit stands still amidst the fight]  He's
       going to do something and you know it's going to be good.
        [Marge pulls him back into the house and shuts the door]
        [inside, a loud ninja yell can be heard, followed by a thump]
Homer: Aw...
-- Your very own Jackie Chan, 

Bodies fly outside the kitchen window while Homer and Marge have
coffee. Homer apologizes for failing to help, but Marge tells him she
loves him for he always try to.  Sleepy kids step into the kitchen.

 Lisa: [yawning] What's going on outside?
Marge: Oh it's just a mob war.  Go back to sleep, honey.
        [the "little guy" is tossed through the kitchen window]
  Man: [wiping glass from his suit and bowing] Forgive-a-ness, please!
       [runs out the backdoor to return to the fight]
-- Bless that Yakuza, 

[End of Act Three.  Time: 21:11]

 EPISODE TITLE: Mountain of Madness


EPISODE SUMMARY:   {ol}

On a sunny day at the SNPP at 8 am, Mr. Burns strolls gleefully into
his office, whistling.

Smithers: Good morning, sir.  Care for some coffee?
   Burns: [joyful] No, the promise of a new day is more than enough
          exhilaration for me.
           [time passes, and Burns gradually loses his energy]
           [at 11:30, his head bangs on his desk]
   Burns: [exhausted] Smithers... coffee.
-- 

A sip is all that's needed to boost his batteries.

   Burns: We need some excitement around here!
Smithers: Chinese checkers or domestic, sir?
   Burns: No, no.  Something fun.  Something the men will enjoy...
          like a safety drill!  But what kind?
-- That sounds like a lot of fun indeed, 

Burns: Meltdown alert?  Mad dog drill?  Blimp attack?  Ah... I think a
       good old-fashioned fire drill today.
        [alarm goes off; most people just stare, intrigued]
 Carl: All right, popcorn's ready!
        [takes the bag out of the microwave and pours kernels in a bowl]
Homer: Hey... that's the fire alarm.
 Carl: We gotta get out of here.
Lenny: Wait for me!  [filling a cup at the cocoa machine]  Come on, come
       on, come on!
-- Why save your life when there's cocoa?, 

All around the plant, it's panic and havoc.  One man grabs an
extinguisher, and proceeds to hit anyone nearing him.

Homer storms into his sector and frantically tries to decide which
framed picture on his panel he should rescue.  Out of all the family
photos, he chooses a black and white of himself dressed like a cowboy.

Mr. Burns and Smithers stand outside the plant, waiting for Burns'
victims to evacuate.

   Burns: Is it supposed to take this long?  What's a good time for a
          mass evacuation of the entire plant?
Smithers: Forty five seconds.
   Burns: And what's our time so far?
Smithers: I don't know, sir.  This stopwatch only goes up to fifteen
          minutes.
   Burns: Damnation!  What kind of slow coaches do I have working for
          me?
           [Homer runs out the door]
-- Does that answer your question?, 

Homer shuts the door and secures it with a bench, before he runs,
panting, to his boss.

Homer: I think I won, Mr. Burns.
Burns: Yes.  [hauntingly]  You won, all right.  You won more than you
       bargained for.
Homer: Woo-hoo!
-- 

Mr. Burns scolds his employees (who finally made an escape, albeit
messily) for showing a lack of teamwork.  Lenny and Carl get into a
fistfight, proving his point.  The crowd cheers the fight, but Mr.
Burns shows disappointment.

At the dinnertable, Homer explains the day's events.

     Homer: So, Mr. Burns is gonna make us all go on a stupid corporate
            retreat up in the mountains to learn about teamwork.
            Which means we'll have to cancel our plans to hang around
            here.
      Bart: Teamwork is overrated.
     Homer: Huh?
      Bart: Think about it.  I mean, what team was Babe Ruth on?  Who
            knows.
Lisa+Marge: Yankees.
      Bart: Sharing is a bunch of bull, too.  And helping others.  And
            what's all this crap I've been hearing about tolerance?
     Homer: Hmm.  Your ideas are intriguing to me and I wish to
            subscribe to your newsletter.  
-- Bartweek Monthly, 

Nevertheless, the family will have to attend to the retreat.

At a snow-covered Mt. Useful, the family tries to park the
stationwagon, but it only succeeds in slipping around on the ice,
bumping into cars. Homer finally decides to park it somewhere in the
proximity of their intended parking space.

Mr. Burns hosts the event, preparing his employess for what will be
"the most arduous and back-breaking weekend of their life."  At that
point, he notices Homer has brought his family, which he was not
supposed to do.  At any rate, since it's too late to take them back,
they'll have to stay there.  The kids moan.

 Marge: Don't worry, kids.  This is a national park.  We can have lots
        of fun!
Ranger: Oh, I'm afraid that's no longer true, ma'am.  Budget cutbacks
        have forced us to eliminate anything the least bit entertaining.
         [long pause]
        Well, uh, see ya.
-- And that's just a sample, 

Smithers: Each two-man team will work its way through the wilderness to
          a cabin hidden somewhere on this mountain.  The routes are
          trecherous, so use your maps.
   Homer: [raising hand] Uhh, I lost my map.
Smithers: You haven't been issued a map, yet.
-- Better safe than sorry, 

Smithers: When you arrive at the cabin, there will be a congratulatory
          party with sandwiches and moderately-priced champagne.
           [the crowd applauds]
   Burns: Now, as an added incentive, the second-to-last team to arrive
          at the cabin will receive an hilarious "world's first employee
          trophy."
   Homer: Hey, this sounds like fun!
   Burns: And the last team to arrive will be fired.
   Homer: [chuckles]  [realizing] Uh-oh.
-- 

And to show that I'm not playing favorites, both Smithers and I will be
participating. Who knows?  I might be the unlucky one who gets fired.
[sotto voce] Not bloody likely.
-- Mr. Burns' confidence, 

Smithers: I've placed all your names in this hat.
   Homer: Ooh!
Smithers: Thank you.
-- 

Smithers: Now pair off as I draw your names.  Lenny and... Carl.
    Carl: Aw nuts!  I mean, um... Aw nuts.
-- 

Team after team, the employees are paired off.  Fong and Zutroy.
Kimball and Dawson.  Haney and Drucker.  Simpson and... Burns?!  Homer
moans, but then realizes he's on the one possible team that can't be
fired.

Smithers: Sir, this can't be right.  You assured me this drawing was
          rigged so we'd be teammates.
   Burns: Yes, well, frankly, you've been a bit of a pill lately.
Smithers: Why do we always fight on vacation?
-- Perhaps the boathouse was indeed the time, 

Well, there's only one name left.  Whoever it is will be paired with me.
And that person is -- Waylon Smithers.  Perfect.  That's just perfect.
-- Smithers, 

Mr. Burns prepares the pairs for the starting point.  Upon shooting
off the gun to start the crowd, Mr. Burns sinks into the snow. "Ready,
Mr. Burns?"  "One moment," Mr. Burns replies to Homer.  He shoots into
the snow to bring himself out the snow.  The employees' adventure
begins.

[End of Act One.  Time: 5:55]

At the Mt. Useful Visitors Center, the kids are looking for something
to pass time.  Bart tries a Smokey the Bear robot.

Smokey: Only who can prevent forest fires?
         [Bart chooses the "You" button over the "Me"]
        You pressed "you," referring to me.  That is incorrect.  The
        correct answer is "you".
  Bart: [kicks the robot]  Mom, can Lisa and I play outside -- away from
        the bear?
-- 

Marge sends them out, telling them to come back when they get
apple-cheeked.  After they run outside, Marge discovers she's been
holding Maggie (in her big five-pointed baggie) upside-down.

Smithers, meanwhile, is hiking up the snowy mountain, alone, cursing
Mr. Burns.

Smithers: How could you do this to me, Mr. Burns?  After all I've done
          for you.  Why, if you were here, I'd kick you right in your
          boney old behind!
           ["boney old behind" echoes]
   Burns: Why, thank you, Simpson!  I have been watching my figure.
-- Gotta keep that healthy skeletal look, 

Bart pulls back a snow-covered leaf branch preparing to smack Lisa
with snow, calling her over to see two snowflakes that are identical.
Lisa ducks, and the launched snow pelts Smithers instead.

    Lisa: Hi, Mr. Smithers.
Smithers: Oh great.  It's the Bobsey Twins.  Well take your prying eyes
          elsewhere.
-- Careful, you might need 'em one day to get out of jail,
      

Smithers apologizes, claiming it's been a harsh day, and that he must
get to the cabin real soon.

    Lisa: We'll help you.
    Bart: I have a watch with a minute hand.
Smithers: [sighs] All right, you can come.  What time is it?
    Bart: 12:80.  No wait.  Wait.  Wh-what comes after 12?
Smithers: One.
    Bart: No, after twelve!
Smithers: [groan]
-- Smithers and the kids, a new sitcom idea, 

Burns: Tell me, Simpson.  If an opportunity arose for taking a small
       shortcut, you wouldn't be adverse to taking it, would you?
Homer: Uhh, not as such.
Burns: Neither would I.  I've always felt that there's far too much
       hysteria these days about so-called cheating.
Homer: Yes, a lot of -- hysteria. [worried look]
Burns: Mm-hmm.  If you can take advantage of a situation in some way,
       it's your duty as an American to do it.  Why should the race
       always be to the swift or the jumble to the quick-witted?  Should
       they be allowed to win merely because of the gifts God gave them?
       Well, I say cheating is the gift man gives himself!
Homer: Mr. Burns, I insist that we cheat.
Burns: Excellent.
-- 

It just so happens that there's a conveniently placed snowmobile (or
"horseless sleigh", to put it in Burns' words) hidden behind a bush.

Homer: Wow, you sure know how to cheat, Mr. Burns.
Burns: Yes, well, I'm older than you.
Burns: You know, Simpson, you're not as objectionable as you seemed when
       we first met.
Homer: No, sir, I am not.
-- The right answer, 

Homer steps on the sleigh, which immediately sinks in the snow.  Burns
turns the power on, and the two of them glide on (or rather, dig
through) the snow.

Looking around for Bart and Lisa, Marge wanders into a dark room.  She
turns a switch on, and a projector starts.

Narrator: The story of our national parks begins in 1872.  Perhaps we
          should let John Muir tell the tale.
    Muir: [as if drunk] Oh, yeah, I remember... [followed by
          incomprehensible mumbling]
           [Marge stares]
-- 

 Marge: Excuse me, sir?  I can't find my children.
Ranger: Have you checked the woods?
 Marge: No.
Ranger: Hmm.  Follow me.  We'll take the chair lift.  It'll give us an
        eagle-eye view of the area directly beneath the chair lift.
-- 

The two of them sit on the chair lift.

Ranger: I won't lie to you.  Our chances of finding your children are
        slim to nil.
  Lisa: [from below]  Hi mom!
         [Smithers and the kids are waving at Marge]
 Marge: There they are!  Let me down here.
Ranger: Sorry.  There's no way off till we get to the top, and even then
        it's sort of tricky.
 Marge: [grunts]  [yelling] All right, kids, we'll meet you at the top!
        Just be careful!
Ranger: Uh, actually, I'm a little more concerned about us.
         [one of the two rails holding the chair snaps]
        Um, do you know how to weld?
-- Up the creek without a paddle, 

Homer and Mr. Burns, in their motorized sleigh, get the the cabin
first.

Burns: We have several hours before the others arrive, let's say we get
       comfy.
       [turns on the fusebox]  Now we have electricity.
       [turns on the gas]  This propane tank will supply us with heat.
       And this doorknob, properly turned, will allow us access to the
       cabin.
Homer: No going through the window for us!
-- Simple luxuries, 

Meanwhile, Smithers is still ascending the mountain, leaving a
straight trail of footsteps behind him.  Another trail can be seen,
zigzagging from tree to tree along his path.

    Bart: Is there maple syrup in this one?
Smithers: There isn't any food in any of these trees.  Please, Bart,
          we've got to hurry!  I can't be the last one to reach the
          cabin.
    Bart: Hey, I'm not gonna get fired.  Is there any gold in this
          mountain?
Smithers: [sputtering] It doesn't matter!
    Bart: I'll check.  [draws a knife, and starts digging]
    Lisa: [running] Mr. Smithers!  Mr. Smithers!  I found another hurt
          shrew.  I think this one has a twisted ankle.
Smithers: [sighs] Twisted ank... [sputters] Aren't there any healthy
          animals in this forest?
-- I can hear God laughing at you, 

"I don't suppose the others will mind us starting the party early,
Homie, old boy?" justifies Mr. Burns, as he and Homer relax in chairs
with their feet kicked up on the table set with the congratulatory
banquet.

Homer: You know, Mr. Burns, you're the richest guy I know.  Way richer
       than Lenny.
Burns: Oh yes.  But I'd trade it all for a little more.
-- 

Homer: Oh, these sure are comfortable chairs.
Burns: Oh, yes, sitting.  The great leveler.  From the mightiest Pharaoh
       to the lowliest peasant, who doesn't enjoy a good sit?
Homer: Oh, man, you are so right.  Did you ever sit like this?
       [lazily slides down, resting more of his legs on the table]
Burns: Yes, yes, that's it.  Oh, I could go for one of those right now.
       [does as Homer did]
       The only hard part is getting up.
Homer: [chuckles] Why get up?  Here's a little move I've been tinkering
       with.  Say I want that bowl of dip.
        [said bowl is at the other end of the table]
Burns: Why, you'd have to get up.
Homer: Oh?  [bangs his foot on the table]
       [at each hit, the bowl bounces closer to him]
       [gives the final blow]  Dip!  [the bowl jumps in his palm]
Burns: [admiring] Sir, I am in your debt.
Homer: Use it wisely, my friend.
-- Homer Wan Kenobi, 

Homer and Mr. Burns toast their glasses, and the clink noise echoes
and causes a rumbling.  An avalanche starts and snow begins to travel
down the mountain and cover the cabin completely.

Lenny: Hey, did you hear something?
 Carl: No.
Lenny: Hmm.  Did I?
 Carl: [exhasperated] I don't know.
-- Teamwork at work, 

Mr. Burns and Homer are under a table.  "Hope that wasn't an
avalanche. Be a gentlemen and take a look-see."  Homer agrees and
opens the door and quite a bit of snow pours into the cabin.  He tries
the window. Said event happens again.  "Isn't there any way out of
here?" Burns inquires. "I don't see one.  Unless...!" Homer reopens
the front door, before giving up.

Mr. Burns decides to use the telegraph to send an S.O.S.  The
telegraph signal only manages to reach a telegraph machine stored
inside a museum exhibit of Samuel Morse.

Just on top of them, Lenny and Carl are standing on a huge mountain of
snow.

 Carl: According to the map, the cabin should be right here.
Lenny: Hey, maybe there is no cabin.  Maybe it's one of them
       metaphorical things.
 Carl: Oh yeah, yeah...  Like maybe the cabin is the place inside each
       of us, created by our goodwill and teamwork.
Lenny: [in a flash of insight] Ohhh!
       Nah, they said there would be sandwiches.
-- Confucianism and sandwiches, 

Mr. Burns and Homer, meanwhile, are trying to dig a tunnel through the
snow.

Burns: Simpson, I have a confession.  I'm not quite the tunnel-digger I
       made myself out to be.
Homer: You can supervise me.
Burns: All right, good!  Let's dig!  That's right!  Dig some more!  Oh,
       we make quite a duo -- Burns and associate.  No, no, what am I
       thinking?  Burns and teammate.
-- Such recognition..., 

At that point, they see the light at the end of the tunnel.  Poking
their heads out, they exchange high-fours and "huzzah", enough noise
to reawaken the avalanche.  They tumble down the tunnel, which is
quickly re-clogged by the snow.

[End of Act Two.  Time: 14:12]

Again, Homie and Burnsie are trapped in the cabin, hiding underneath
the table.

Burns: What happened?
        [snow rumbles]
Homer: I think when we yelled we caused another avalanche.
        [rumble]
Burns: [whispering] We should... be... careful... not... to speak...
       unless... it's... absolutely... pos-i-tively... necessary.
        [violent rumbling]
Homer: Shh.  [rumble]  You're... causing... more... avalanches.
       [rumble]  I [rumble] think [rumble] they've [rumble] stopped.
        [violent rumble]
Burns: Let's go.
        [violent rumble]
-- Rumble rumble rumble rake scene rumble rumble, 

They get up from underneath the table.  Mr. Burns creeps slowly
towards the door, opens it, and is buried up to his chest in snow.
Teamwork suddenly goes out the window.

Burns: Those last three avalanches were your fault, Simpson.
Homer: So what?
Burns: Sew buttons!
        [narrow eyes at each other]
-- 

Lenny and Carl make it up to a cabin, and decide it has to be the
one. Inside, there's nothing there but a desk and chair, a fireplace
and a moosehead.

Lenny: Well, we made it here first.  All thanks to teamwork.
 Carl: Yeah, my teamwork.
-- 

Back at the snowed-in cabin, Burns and Homer try to pass some time,
since they're not going to be found any soon.

Hmm.  No books, no radio, no boardgames.  Ah!  A "Bazooka Joe" comic!
Ugh, I read that one seventy five years ago!
-- Believe me Monty, they haven't inproved since, 

Homer: We could build snowmen.
Burns: No, I have a better idea!  We could build real men, out of snow!
Homer: Oh.  Okay...
-- A new generation of Frosty the Snowmans, 

The other freezing campers arrive at the cabin and bundle around the
fire.  Lenny tosses the moosehead into the fire to increase the flame.
Smithers, Bart and Lisa arrive at this cabin.

    Lisa: Mr. Smithers, Mr. Smithers!  That moose is on fire!
Smithers: Fine, good.  I don't care anymore.
-- 

Smithers sighs of relief when hearing he's not the last one to reach
the cabin, but relief turns to worry when he learns who's left out
there.

Back at the cabin (once more), Homer's done with his snowman.  Next to
him, Burns contemplates his own creation.

Burns: Ah, 206 bones, 50 miles of small intestine, full pouting lips.
       Why, this fellow is less a snowman... than a god.
        [pan to a snowman identical to Homer's]
-- And what a god, 

Stupidly, they decide the snowmen must be dressed and give them their
clothes.  Freezing in thin blankets, they stare at their snowman
counterparts in their underwear.

Burns: Look at them.  Smug and secure in their finery.  Mocking us.
Homer: Uh, they're just snowmen, Mr. Burns.
Burns: Ah, snowmen have peepers.  Peepers to watch.  To watch for a
       moment of weakness and then BAFF comes the knock in the head and
       we're down!
Homer: [worriedly] What do we do??
Burns: Oh...wouldn't you like to know.
-- 

The ranger and Marge step inside the cabin (no, the other one).

  Ranger: Hey, what is going on here?  Who are you people?  This is a
          lookout post.  Where is Ranger McFadden?
   Drunk: [slurred] I was just happy to see some of the nice people!
  Ranger: Quiet, you drunk.  Where's ranger McFadden?
McFadden: Right here, sir.  Right behind the drunk.
-- 

Smithers figures out they must be in the wrong place, and the ranger
points out to the only other cabin, which is just over... well, it
used to be where that big mount of snow is standing now.  McFadden
takes a look at the sismograph.

McFadden: [whistles]  Look at all these avalanches.  Do you think they
          could have buried the cabin?
  Ranger: Well, I'll tell you one thing: they didn't come here for the
          mountain music festival.  March 14th to 18th.
-- Good luck when the tuba starts playing, 

Back at the "undersnow" cabin for one last time, Mr. Burns and Homer
are sitting and staring at each other, drifting into madness and
paranoia.

Hmm.  Look at his eyes.  He's trying to hypnotize me, but not in the
good Las Vegas way.
-- Homer, 

Finally, Burns suspects Homer is trying to bump him off.  He grabs a a
fireplace poker and arms himself, thinking "He can't kill me if I kill
him first!"

Burns: I'll kill you, you bloated museum of trechery!
Homer: You and what army?
        [imagines Nazi snowmen behind Burns]
       [gasps and shakes] Stand back!  I have powers!  [threateningly]
       Political powers!
Burns: [imagines dead world leaders behind Homer] Uuh!
-- Slightly revised history with Gandhi playing kick-boxing,
      

Homer, Burns and their hallucenated armys go head to head.  After much
fighting, Mr. Burns prepares to hit Homer with the fireplace poker but
only hits the Propane tank.  Cracks develop on the rattling tank, and
the cabin is jet-launched in a rocket-like manner.  Through the snow
shoots the cabin.

Meanwhile, everyone at the lookout post is preparing to rescue
airborne Mr. Burns and Homer.

Ranger: Okay, search party, before we set out, let's take a moment to
        humor the children.
        [to Bart and Lisa] Kids, your father's gonna be just fine!
        Okay, everybody, put on your corpse-handling gloves, we've got
        two frozen bodies buried somewhere in this mountain.
  Bart: Did you hear that, Lis'?  Dad's gonna be just fine.
-- Uh, yeah, I suppose..., 

Lisa directs their attention to something you don't see everyday: a
flame-propelled cabin surfing down the mountain.

Oh Lord, protect this rockethouse and all who dwell within the
rockethouse.
-- Homer, 

Smithers: It's them, all right.
   Marge: We're over here, Homie!
   Lenny: Oh, something's wrong with its breaks!  Gangway!
-- They ain't makin' rockethouses like in the good ol' days,
      

Everyone clears out, screaming.  The tank's gas runs out and the cabin
slows and comes to a hault just a few feet away from the lookout post.
Homer greets his worried family, who swarm around him to hug him.  Mr.
Burns doesn't seem too traumatized to remind everyone of the
competition, sending everyone rushing into the cabin, Lenny being the
last to show.  The poor man walks away.

   Burns: So, how did we do?
Smithers: [looking at his stopwatch] It's a new record, sir.
   Burns: Outstanding.  Well, perhaps all of this has been worthwhile.
          Did you all learned about teamwork?
Everyone: [unenthusiastically] Yes.
-- 

Outside, Lenny's standing with a liquor bottle in hand.

That old goat can't fire me!  I'm gonna give him a piece of my mi...
[falls in a hole, screaming]
 [thud]
Aw nuts!
-- Lenny's answer to every problem, 

Burns: Well, Simpson, I must say, once you've been through something
       like that with a person, you never want to see that person
       again.
Homer: You said it, you weirdo!
        [Burns and Homer laugh, then narrow their eyes at each other]
        [continue to laugh ad nauseam]
        [narrow their eyes at each other again]

[End of Act Three.  Time: 21:27]

 EPISODE TITLE: Simpsonscalifragilisticexpiala-d'oh-cious


EPISODE SUMMARY:   {ol} {dga}

OFF is watching TV.

Announcer: It's the Krusty Komedy Klassic!
   Krusty: Hey, hey!  It's great to be back at the Apollo Theater,
           and...  [notices the letters behind him] K-K-K?  That's not
           good...
-- "Simpsoncalifragilisticexpiala-D'oh-cious"

The audience seems to agree, as people start throwing food items.
Krusty does a pretty good job at dodging them at first, but beer cans
and bottles quickly get the upper hand.

In front of the tube, the family is eating on TV trays, while Krusty
attempts to savior his program.

Now I'd like to introduce a new feature never before seen on T.V. --
Dumb Pet Tricks!
-- Krusty steals another bit, "Simpsoncalifragilisticexpiala-D'oh-cious"

Krusty: Here's a dog that's been trained to catch this red rubber ball.
         [throws the ball]
         [the dog, of course, goes for Krusty's clown nose]
        Ow!  Somebody shoot it!  Somebody shoot it!
-- "Simpsoncalifragilisticexpiala-D'oh-cious"

Bart remarks that the Krusty specials are getting worse every year.
Lisa searches for the remote, but it's mysteriously disappeared...

Grampa: [dials the remote]  Hello??  Hello??  Stupid cordless phone!
        I'll try the old fashioned model.  [speaks into an iron]  Ahh,
        that's better.  How ya doin', Gertie?
-- Any faxes on the waffle iron?,
      "Simpsoncalifragilisticexpiala-D'oh-cious"

Meanwhile, back on the tube...

Krusty: And now, our parody of "Mad About You" entitled "Mad About 
	Shoe."  [Krusty lies in a bed with a giant piece of footwear] 
	Give me a kiss, baby.  No tongue!  [audience members boo and 
        throw things]  Urgh.  You're not going to like our "NYPD Shoe"
        sketch.  It's pretty much the same thing.
-- Except we see him nude, "Simpsoncalifragilisticexpiala-D'oh-cious"

 Bart: Ma, could you get me some milk?
Marge: [feeding Maggie]  Can't you get it yourself?
 Bart: No, that's okay.  I'll just go without liquid.
       [acts as if he desperately needs something to drink]
Marge: Oh, all right, all right!  I'll get your milk.
        [goes into the kitchen]
 Bart: Thank you.
Marge: [from the kitchen] Does anyone else want anything while I'm up?
  All: No.
        [Marge returns with Bart's glass of milk]
Homer: Marge, get me a beer.
Marge: Oooh!
-- Now who didn't see that coming?,
      "Simpsoncalifragilisticexpiala-D'oh-cious"

      Lisa: Uh, Mom?
     Marge: [annoyed] What?!
      Lisa: Um, there's a hair in my soup.  But I'll just eat around it.
     Marge: What kind of hair?
      Lisa: Well, it's blue.  [produces it]  Six feet long.
Homer+Bart: Eww!
-- I wonder whose it is?, "Simpsoncalifragilisticexpiala-D'oh-cious"

Marge correctly guesses that the hair belongs to her, and leaves,
almost in tears.

Your mother seems really upset about something.  I better go have a talk
with her -- during the commercial.
-- Homer, always the supportive husband,
      "Simpsoncalifragilisticexpiala-D'oh-cious"

Back to the show...

Krusty: Now, let's hear it for a great American.  Former President
	Gerald Ford.
  Ford: Thank you, Krusty, for inviting me.
Krusty: Well, all the good presidents turned us down.
  Ford: Oh.  Well, I'd like to talk about a subject that is very 
	important to me.  [Krusty makes faces in the background as Ford 
	continues speaking] The Boy Scouts of America have molded men 
	for over a hundred years and... [Ford notices Krusty's antics] 
	What are you...
Krusty: Uh, how's your wife, Nancy?
  Ford: Betty.
Krusty: Who cares?
-- The Nancy Ford Clinic?, "Simpsoncalifragilisticexpiala-D'oh-cious"

Later, Homer, lying in bed, speaks in seductive tones to his wife.

Oh, Marge, I just had a couple of beers.
-- From Romeo to Homer, "Simpsoncalifragilisticexpiala-D'oh-cious"

He is shocked out of his ardor, however, as he accidentally pulls out
a handful of her bouffant.

Whence follows a brief musical interlude, played on the song "Hair".
While showering, she finds a mess of her hair in the small puddle on
the floor of the shower.  During dinner, Snowball II coughs up a huge
hairball belonging to Marge.  While blowdrying, the hair-dryer blows
hair out of her tall bouffant, producing a hole.  While Milhouse plays
cowboys and Indians with Bart, a tumbleweed of Marge's hair blows by.
In church, Marge's hair no longer balances in the air and it falls
back behind herself, landing on Jasper's head.  Jasper knocks it off
and it hits Mrs. Glick, who is in the seat in front of Marge.  Glick
and Jasper begin knocking it back and forth as Marge looks distressly
annoyed.

Somewhat later, Homer, once again, speaks seductively to his wife, who
is wearing a scarf around her towering hairdo.

Homer: Marge, I was just watching women's volleyball on ESPN.
        [Marge murmurs appreciatively]
       Come on, there's no need for that Babamabushka.
-- "Simpsoncalifragilisticexpiala-D'oh-cious"

Marge takes it off, and Homer screams at what he sees: holes
everywhere throughout Marge's magnificent coiffure.  Marge pronounces
sadly, "I'm losing my hair."

Homer: Now, sweetie, don't worry about a thing.  I'll teach you to comb 
       it over so no one can tell.  Just like my hair!  [Marge imagines 
       herself with a Homer-esque comb-over, and breaks into sobs]
-- A fate worse than death?, "Simpsoncalifragilisticexpiala-D'oh-cious"

At the doctor's...

Hibbert: Mrs. Simpson, there's no physical reason why your hair should 
         be falling out.  This thing has me buffaloed.  [chuckles]
  Nurse: Phone call, Mrs. Simpson.  Lines one and two.
   Bart: [line one] Ma, I need a glass of milk.
   Lisa: [line two] Me, too.
          [as Marge grunts, a bit of her hair falls out]
Hibbert: I think the problem may be stress.
-- Well, duh, "Simpsoncalifragilisticexpiala-D'oh-cious"

Marge arrives back at home, where everybody is loafing around the
sofa. Marge tells her family about Dr. Hibbert's diagnosis, and
suggests that she get some help by hiring a nanny.  Homer wonders how
they'll be able to pay for it, but Lisa believes that since Marge
makes so many sacrifices for them, they should make one for her.

 Lisa: I'll stop buying Malibu Stacey clothing.
 Bart: And I'll take up smoking and give that up.
Homer: Good for you, son.  Giving up smoking is one of the hardest
       things you'll ever have to do.  Have a dollar.
        [gives a dollar bill to Bart]
 Lisa: But he didn't do anything!
Homer: Didn't he, Lisa?  Didn't he?
-- "Simpsoncalifragilisticexpiala-D'oh-cious"

But Homer wakes up and takes back the dollar.

 Homer: All right, Marge, I'll get you your nanny.  And to pay for it,
        I'll give up the Civil War re-creation society I love so much.
         [at Moe's, everyone, including Moe, is dressed like 1800s
         military generals]
   Moe: [hangs up the phone] Well, Homer's out.  We gotta find a new
        General Ambrose Burnside.
Barney: [dressed like Lincoln] But I'm not too crazy about our Stonewall
        Jackson.
         [Apu emerges from the Men's room dressed like a Hindu military
         official]
   Apu: The south shall [brightly] come again!
-- At least they aren't using monkeys,
	"Simpsoncalifragilisticexpiala-D'oh-cious"

Meanwhile, at the Simpson household, Marge and Homer are interviewing
job applicants.

Pennyfeather: Hello, I'm Mrs. Pennyfeather.  I understand you are
              looking for a nanny.
       Marge: Pleased to meet you.
       Homer: Wait a minute, Marge.  I saw "Mrs. Doubtfire."  This is a
              man in drag!  [starts pulling at her hair as if it were a
              wig] You're phony!  Fakey, phony broad!  [runs after her]
              Gimme those!
       Marge: Homer, if you're going to do that to every applicant,
              we're never going to find one.
       Homer: Sorry.
  Periwinkle: Hello, I'm Mrs. Periwinkle.
               [Homer growls and jumps after her]
-- NARW: Nannies Against Robin Williams,
      "Simpsoncalifragilisticexpiala-D'oh-cious"

Kearney is another applicant.

Kearney: I'm here about the nanny job.  I'll keep a watchful eye on your
         kids and if they get out of line [smacks fist in palm] -- Pow!
  Homer: I like him.
Kearney: Thanks.  Hey, where do you keep the liquor?
  Homer: I hide a bottle of schnapps in the baby's crib.
  Marge: I'm sorry, young man.  You're not what we're looking for.
Kearney: [sotto voce] You're tellin' me, you blue-haired witch.
  Marge: I heard that!
-- "Simpsoncalifragilisticexpiala-D'oh-cious"

Later, in the kitchen.

Marge: I guess we're not going to find anyone.
 Lisa: We have our own suggestions for the new nanny.  Would you like to 
       hear them?
Homer: You have my undivided attention.  [Meanwhile, in Homer's brain, 
       goofy animals dance to "Turkey in the Straw."]
-- "Simpsoncalifragilisticexpiala-D'oh-cious"

Marge, on the other hand, would be happy to hear her children's
suggestions, which take the form of a musical number.  Lisa wants a
wise and caring nanny, Bart wants her to be rather permissive, and
Homer wants her to be low-paid and "no fat chicks."  But all agree:
anyone but Grampa.  Marge notes that it's unlikely that they'll find
anyone that perfect.  But then...

High in the sky, a figure glides towards 742 Evergreen Terrace,
hanging onto an umbrella.  She coughs at the smoke from the SNPP
towers, spins around the power lines a few times, scratches the roof
of Homer's car, and finally comes to a landing at the door.  Is it a
bird?  A plane? Julie Andrews?  No, it's...

Shary: Hello, I'm Shary Bobbins.
Homer: Did you say Mary Po...
Shary: No, I definitely did not.  I'm an original creation, like Rickey 
       Rouse, or Monald Muck.
-- Trademarks of the Diz-Nee corporation, 
      "Simpsoncalifragilisticexpiala-D'oh-cious"

 Shary: Now, as your nanny, I'll do everything from telling stories to 
	changing diapers.
Grampa: Put me down for one of each.
-- Eww, "Simpsoncalifragilisticexpiala-D'oh-cious"

[End of Act I.  Time: 7:44]

The family is interviewing Miss Bobbins.  Homer's first questions is
about bad habits, and Shary Bobbins claims she's practically perfect.
"So am I" replies Homer, before drinking milk out of the carton and
scratching his butt.  After a good belch, the interview continues.

 Homer: Question two.  Who was your last employer?
 Shary: Lord and Lady Huffington of Sussex.
 Homer: [whispering] Marge, do we know them?
 Marge: No.
 Homer: Come on!  Isn't he the guy I bowl with?  The black guy.
 Marge: That's Carl.
 Homer: Oh yeah!  [back to Shary]  So!  You worked for Carl, eh?
-- "Simpsoncalifragilisticexpiala-D'oh-cious"

 Bart: Pop quiz, hotshot.  I'm supposed to be doing my homework, but you
       find me upstairs reading a Playdude.  What do you do?  What DO
       you do?
Shary: I make you read every article in that magazine, including Norman
       Mailer's latest clap-trap about his waning libido.
Homer: Ooh.  She is tough.
-- "Simpsoncalifragilisticexpiala-D'oh-cious"

Marge tells her that she's hired.  Shary takes the children to their
room, riding the banister upstairs, to everyone's amazement.

Marge: My, she seems too good to be true.
Homer: I'll say.  Her butt waxed the banister.
Marge: Ooh, I can see myself!
-- Now that's shiny!, "Simpsoncalifragilisticexpiala-D'oh-cious"

Bart's bedroom is a disaster, and Shary tells the kids that they need
to clean it up.  They are reluctant to do so, until she starts a
helpful musical number about doing it the "American Way."

Shary covers a pile of clothes on Bart's bed with the covers.  Bart
crams toys and things into his drawer.  Lisa stashes balls underneath
the bed. On the other side of the bed, Bart is stashing a box
containing toys and a half eaten sandwich under it.  Lisa picks up
some toys (and Maggie) and drops it all (including Maggie) into the
toy chest.  Bart empties his wastebasket outside the window.  He puts
more crumpled up papers in the basket and then empties it outside
again.  THEN he throws out the wastebakset entirely.

Bart goes over to the closet with a pile of clothes and tosses it in
the already full closet and he, Lisa and Shary try to close the door.
Once the song is done, the family marches out Bart's room and shut the
door, causing everything to fall apart, with the mess being restored.
(Maggie lifts up the toy chest and looks around)

Shary goes down the street, strolling Maggie in a baby buggy and a
properly dressed Bart and Lisa walk alongside her.  Everyone seems to
know her lovingly.  Nelson even picked posies for her.  She thanks him
with a kiss and he blushes.

Meanwhile, Willy is entertaining a crowd with his accordion rendition
of "Maniac" which he closes by pulling a rope that causes a bucket to
spill water on him.  Everyone walks away giving him no applause.
"Thank you, you ungrateful bast..." he goes, just before seeing Shary.

 Shary: Hello, Willie.
  Lisa: You know her?
Willie: Aye.  Shary Bobbins and I were engaged to be wed back in the old 
	country.  Then she got her eyesight back.  Suddenly the ugliest 
	man in Glasgow wasn't good enough for her
 Shary: It's good to see you, Willie.
Willie: [angry] That's not what you said the first time you saw me!
-- It was more along the lines of "Oh my god!",
      "Simpsoncalifragilisticexpiala-D'oh-cious"

As they walk through the park, things look more and more like
nineteenth-century London...

Kearney: Extra, extra!  Ripper strikes in White chapel!
Skinner: Boy for sale!  Boy for sale!
  Jimbo: Is this legal, man?
Skinner: Only here, and in Mississippi.
-- "Simpsoncalifragilisticexpiala-D'oh-cious"

Shary and her young charges are flying kites, (with Maggie's attached
to her pacifier) when Burns and Smithers wander by.

   Burns: Bah, humbug.
   Shary: Oh, Mr. Burns, I think you'll find all life's problems just 
	  float away when you're flying a kite.  [gives him one]
   Burns: Balderdash.  This is the silliest load of... [watches his 
	  kite] ...oh, look at it fly!  Whee-hee-hee-hee-hee!  Look at 
          me, Smithers.
           [dark clouds gather ominously]
          I feel practically Superduperfragicalicexpiala-d'oh!
           [lightning strikes the kite and shocks Mr. Burns, knocking
           him on the ground]
          What's this strange sensation in my chest?
Smithers: I think your heart's beating again.
   Burns: Oh, that takes me back.  God bless you, Shary Bobbins.
-- Always a silver lining, "Simpsoncalifragilisticexpiala-D'oh-cious"

Back at home, Marge, with fuller hair, surveys the tidy house with
Homer.

Marge: That Shary Bobbins is a miracle worker.  The kids love her, the
       house is spotless, and my hair's grown back.  It's so full and
       thick it can support a beach umbrella.
        [sticks a beach umbrella in the top of her hair]
        [it unfolds]
Homer: Come to bed, Marge!
Marge: [amorously] Wooo.
        [starts to remove the umbrella]
Homer: No, no.  Leave it in.
        [they giggle and go upstairs]
-- Kinky!, "Simpsoncalifragilisticexpiala-D'oh-cious"

The three children are preparing for sleep.

Shary: It's 8:00, children.  Time for bed.
 Lisa: But we're not sleepy.
 Bart: Sing us a song, Shary Bobbins.
 Lisa: Yes, sing us a song.
Shary: I've been singing you songs all day.  I'm not a bloody jukebox!  
-- Close to the breaking point,
      "Simpsoncalifragilisticexpiala-D'oh-cious"

But their sad faces convince her otherwise, so she tucks them all into
Lisa's bed, grabs a snow dome featuring a bar just like Moe's, and
starts singing a song about "a boozehound named Barney."

At breakfast the next morning, The Simpsons seem to have become a
model family, eating a traditional English breakfast.

Homer: Ooh, I can't get enough of this blood pudding.
 Bart: The secret ingredient is blood.
Homer: Blood?  Ugh!  I'll just stick to the brain and kidney pie, thank
       you.
-- Ignorance is bliss, "Simpsoncalifragilisticexpiala-D'oh-cious"

    Shary: [with bags]  I believe my work here is done.
    Marge: Thank you for everything
Bart+Lisa: We'll miss you, Shary Bobbins.
    Homer: You've changed me as well.  I'm no longer the money-driven 
	   workaholic I once was.
-- Selective memory, "Simpsoncalifragilisticexpiala-D'oh-cious"

Shary leaves the Simpsons home, regretting how she will "never hear
their sweet voices again."  Right then, Homer and Bart burst through
the window, each at the other's throat.  Realizing her work is far
from done, she lets out a sigh and marches back in.

Inside, Lisa walks with no vigor hitting a spoon on a pan.  In the
living room, Maggie extinguishes a fire on the curtain, and on the
window sill sits Marge, fragile, shaking, worried and stressed with
hair falling out her head. She resolves, "Oh, I'll just unpack my
things."

Grampa: [flying out the door] I think we got our umbrellas switched!
        [in the air]  Whee!  I never felt so alive!  [snores]
 Shary: [slaps her hand on her forehead]
-- Abe takes Shary's magic umbrella,

[End of Act Two.  Time: 16:00]

Shary is grinding pepper for Bart's meal.  He wants a little more...
little more...little more...oops!  Too much.  He tells her to take it
back, which she does reluctantly.

 Announcer: Welcome back to "Before They Were Famous."  We all know
	    Rainier Wolfcastle as the star of the blockbuster "McBain" 
	    movies, but here's his first appearance in a commercial in

Shary: Well, you know, Homer [musical intro, Shary starts singing] 
       If there's a job that must be done, 
       You'll find it's much more fun...
Homer: [interrupting] You'll find it's even more fun if you get it
       for me!
Shary: [continuing]
       But the beer will taste more sweet
       If you get up off your seat...

Somewhat later, Bart is throwing cupcakes at the wall of his filthy
room.

Shary: Bart Simpson, this room is a frightful mess.
 Bart: I'll get right on it.  [hurls a cupcake on the wall]
Shary: Bart, don't you remember?  Cleaning up can be a game.
 Bart: I got a better game.  It's called "whipping cupcakes."

Meanwhile, Lisa is watching the latest Itchy &amp; Scratchy Show (special
guest director: Quentin Tarantino).  The title: "Reservoir Cats."

Itchy &amp; Scratchy, both dressed in black suits, are inside an abandoned
warehouse.  Itchy has Scratchy bound to a chair.  As Stealer's Wheel's
"Stuck in the Middle with You" plays, Itchy dances around and splashes
gasoline on Scratchy.  Then, he gleefully brandishes a razor.  The
camera pans away from the chair as we hear Scratchy scream.

Next, we see Itchy holding Scratchy's ear, when the director himself
enters.

Tarantino: What I'm trying to say in this cartoon is that violence is 
	   everywhere in our society, you know, it's like even in 
           breakfast cereals, man.
            [Itchy jumps up and cuts off his head with a razor. Scratchy
            gives him a high-five and the two dance to "Miserlou."]

As Lisa laughs at this, Shary Bobbins enters.

Shary: Lisa, don't sit in front of that telly like a fly stuck on a 
       toffee.  It's a great big world out there.
 Lisa: Been there, done it.
Shary: I know, we could have a tea party on the ceiling.
 Lisa: Shh.  TV!
-- Jaded youth, "Simpsoncalifragilisticexpiala-D'oh-cious"

Shary cries that "you people will be the death of me", and runs out,
sobbing.

Somewhat later, she's a mess, drinking beers with empty bottles
scattered around the couch and floor.

 Shary: [singing, obviously drunk] Wasted away again in Margaritaville.
Barney: Searching for my lost shaker of salt.  [spoken] Oh, here it is.

        gonna sit back and enjoy the ride.

 Homer: Nope.

 EPISODE TITLE: The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show


EPISODE SUMMARY:   {dga}

It's the Krusty the Klown show!

I hope you enjoyed my one-man pie fight, kids!
-- Krusty learns to deal with cutbacks,
      "The Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Poochie Show"

Krusty then introduces the next feature: a new Itchy &amp; Scratchy
cartoon, "Why Do Fools Fall in Lava?"

Tourist Scratchy visits a volcano with a bungee jump, operated by a
certain homicidal mouse.  He pays for the jump, but is shocked when
Itchy slashes him open with a knife, ties his intestines to the
railing, and pushes him over the edge.  Luckily, his fall is broken by
his entrails, suspending him a few feet over the lava.  Up above,
however, Itchy has inserted a funnel into Scratchy's intestine and is
pouring gasoline into it.  Scratchy frantically covers his mouth to
keep any of the flammable liquid from escaping, but eventually, his
cheeks swell up, and Scratchy lets the gasoline burst out of his
mouth.  He is instantly vaporized.

No one in the Simpson home is watching the hilarious antics of the
cat-and-mouse duo, however.  Marge walks through the living room and
notes that the television is on, but the room is empty.  She finds her
children eating cereal in the kitchen.

Marge: You're missing the Itchy &amp; Scratchy Show.  Don't you like it
       anymore?
 Lisa: [reading the back of a Frosty Krusty Flakes cereal box]  Sure, we
       love it.  But how can we watch T.V. when it's so beautiful out?
-- Nature and its 12 essential elements,
      "The Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Poochie Show"

 Bart: Well, yeah, Mom.  I mean, we love you and Dad too, but God knows
       we don't need to see you every day.
Marge: An occasional hug is all I ask.  [hugs him]
 Bart: [protesting] Mom!  You can hug me when I'm asleep.
Marge: I do!
 Bart: [screams]
-- Bart gets weirded out, "The Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Poochie Show"

At Krustylu studios, Roger Myers Jr. steps inside the office of a
groaning Krusty.

 Myers: Hey, Krusty, you look great. You get your teeth bleached?
Krusty: Yeah, it's a new kind of polymer treatment...  [wakes up] Hey,
        shut up!  You're here 'cause your Itchy &amp; Scratchy cartoons are
        stinking up my ratings.  Look at this breakdown of yesterday's
        show.
         [Krusty's finger follows the ratings graph, which suddenly
         plummets at 4:20]
 Myers: What happened here?  Lightning hit the transmitter?
Krusty: See, that's what I thought at first, but then...  [snaps] Hey,
        shut up!
-- "The Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Poochie Show"

Turns out this is when Itchy and Scratchy "crash-landed" on the show.

 Myers: But "Itchy &amp; Scratchy" is critically acclaimed!
Krusty: Acclaimed!?  [spits] I oughta replace it right now with a
        Chinese cartoon where the robots that turn into... blingwads!
-- Ooh, I smell a success story there,
      "The Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Poochie Show"

But Krusty is willing to give one more chance to the cat and mouse
duo.

Krusty: Get out!  Don't come back 'til you fix "Itchy &amp; Scratchy"!
         [Myers walks out, slamming Krusty's office door so hard that it
         comes of the hinges, shattering the window.]
 Woman: Okay, Mel, you can go in now.
         [Sideshow Mel enters, holding a tin can]
   Mel: Krusty, I've come to solicit donations for the Rock 'N Roll
        museum, and...  [Krusty stares at him] uh... I'll come back
        later.
-- Good thinking, "The Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Poochie Show"

At Springfield Mall, Marge is shopping with her three children.

Marge: I need to purchase a brassiere.  You kids wait over here in the
       credit department.
 Bart: Oh, can't we just wander around and meet you back here later?
Marge: Mmm...okay, just be careful.
        [Bart and Lisa run away happily.  Before long, they encounter a
        creepy-looking guy who speaks to them]
  Man: Would you kids like to come with me?
 Bart: [simultaneously with Lisa] Sounds good to me!  Let's go!
 Lisa: [simultaneously with Bart] Okay!  Guess so.
-- Bart and Lisa follow parental advice,
      "The Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Poochie Show"

The man has invited Bart and Lisa to participate in a cartoon focus
group study, along with Ralph, a girl from Bart's class, Nelson, and
Milhouse.  They are excited to learn that they will be watching some
cartoons.

 Man: We want you to tell us what you think.  And, be honest, because no
      one from the show is here spying on you.  [chuckles]
       [a sneezing sound comes from a huge mirror set along a wall of
       the room; the mirror shakes]
Lisa: Why is that mirror sneezing?
 Man: Ah, look, it's just an old, creaky mirror, y'know, sometimes it
      sounds a little like it's sneezing, or coughing, or talking
      softly.
Lisa: [suspiciously]  Hmm...
       [the focus group guy surreptitiously gives a thumbs-up to the
       mirror]
-- Yeah, right, "The Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Poochie Show"

The focus group guy goes on to say that each child has a knob that
they can turn right if they like what they see, left if they don't.

  Man: You each have a knob in front of you.  When you like what you
       see, turn the knob to the right. When you don't like what you
       see, turn it left.
Ralph: [knob in mouth] My knob tastes funny.
  Man: Please refrain from tasting the knob.
-- `17/ of all children dislike the taste of knobs',
      "The Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Poochie Show"

The first cartoon: Playing pool, Itchy knocks out Scratchy's eyeballs
with a cue ball: Scratchy replaces them with the "6" and "9" balls.
Everybody laughs and turns their knobs right.

The next setting is an island.

           [a musclebound man in bikini trunks flexes in front of the
           camera]
           [Nelson slyly turns Milhouse's knob to the right]
Milhouse: Hey, quit it!
   Myers: [supervising the results behind the mirror]  They like Itchy,
          they like Scratchy, one kid seems to love the Speedo man...
          what more do they want?
-- More Speedo men!, more Speedo men!,
      "The Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Poochie Show"

Back with the focus group...

     Man: How many of you kids would like Itchy &amp; Scratchy to deal with
          real-life problems, like the ones you face every day?
    Kids: [clamoring] Oh, yeah!  I would!  Great idea!  Yeah, that's it!
     Man: And who would like to see them do just the opposite -- getting
          into far-out situations involving robots and magic powers?
    Kids: [clamoring] Me!  Yeah!  Oh, cool!  Yeah, that's what I want!
     Man: So, you want a realistic, down-to-earth show... that's
          completely off-the-wall and swarming with magic robots?
    Kids: [all agreeing, quieter this time] That's right.  Oh yeah,
          good.
Milhouse: And also, you should win things by watching.
-- Conflicting results, "The Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Poochie Show"

Myers, fed up, turns on the light in the observation booth, making
himself visible to the kids.

Myers: You kids don't know what you want!  That's why you're still kids;
       'cause you're stupid!
       [sticks his face to the window, difforming his nose]
       Just tell me what's wrong with the freakin' show!
       [turns the lights out]
Ralph: [starts crying, turns the knob left]  Mommy!
-- "The Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Poochie Show"

Lisa takes the stand, walks to the mirror, and explains (to her
reflection) that there's nothing wrong with it, but that after so
many years, the characters lose something of their impact.  Myers
turns the lights on.

 Myers: That's it.  That's it, little girl!  You've saved "Itchy &amp;
        Scratchy"!
Lawyer: Please sign these papers indicating that you did not save "Itchy
        &amp; Scratchy".
-- Taking no chances, "The Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Poochie Show"

At "Itchy &amp; Scratchy, Intl.", Myers has called a meeting of the
writers along with Krusty and a lady from the network.

 Myers: I have figured out how to rejuvenate the show.  It's so simple,
        you egghead writers would've never thought of it!  What we need
        is... a new character!  One that today's kids can relate to!
         [writers look at each other, uncertain]
Oakley: Are you absolutely sure that's wise, sir?  I mean, I don't want
        to sound pretentious here, but Itchy and Scratchy comprise a
        dramaturgical dyad.
Krusty: Hey, this ain't art -- it's business!
-- That's the spirit!, "The Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Poochie Show"

   Krusty: Whaddya got in mind?  Sexy broad?  Gangster octopus?
    Myers: No, no.  The animal chain of command goes mouse, cat, dog.
           [to the writers] D-O-G.
Weinstein: Uh, a dog?  Isn't that a tad predictable?
     Lady: In your dreams.  We're talking the original dog from hell.
   Oakley: You mean Cerberus?
-- Does he drive a `Persephone'?  "The Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Poochie Show"

  Lady: We at the network want a dog with attitude.  He's edgy, he's "in
        your face."  You've heard the expression "let's get busy"?
        Well, this is a dog who gets "biz-zay!"  Consistently and
        thoroughly.
Krusty: So he's proactive, huh?
  Lady: Oh, God, yes.  We're talking about a totally outrageous
        paradigm.
 Meyer: Excuse me, but "proactive" and "paradigm"?  Aren't these just
        buzzwords that dumb people use to sound important?
        [backpedaling] Not that I'm accusing you of anything like that.
        [pause]  I'm fired, aren't I?
 Myers: Oh, yes.
-- Is that what happened to Jon Vitti?,
      "The Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Poochie Show"

 Meyer: The rest of you start writers thinking up a name for this funky
        dog; I dunno, something along the line of say... Poochie, only
        more proactive.
Krusty: Yeah!
         [Myers, Krusty and the lady leave]
Oakley: So, Poochie okay with everybody?
   All: [reclining in their chairs]  Yeah...
-- And thus a dog was born, "The Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Poochie Show"

It's now time for our animator, the exact twin of David Silverman, to
perform his magic and give form to the concept...

            [Silverman draws a standard dog]
    Myers: No, no, no!  He was supposed to have attitude.
Silverman: Um... wh-what do you mean, exactly?
    Myers: Oh, you know, attitude, attitude!  Uh... sunglasses!
     Lady: Could we put him in more of a "hip-hop" context?
   Krusty: Forget context, he's gotta be a surfer.  Give me a nice
           shmear of surfer.
     Lady: I feel we should Rasta-fy him by... 10 percent or so.
            [the resulting dog is rather... proactive]
            [all stare at it w/o any expression]
    Myers: Hmm... I think he needs a little more attitude.
            [Silverman blackens in Poochie's sunglasses]
All Three: [variously] Oh, yeah, bingo.  Yeah, that's it!  There it is,
           right there! I love it!
-- Another cartoon character created in less than 15 minutes,
      "The Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Poochie Show"

The next morning, OFF (with one obvious missing character) is eating
breakfast, when the newspaper headline catches Bart's eye.

 Bart: Hey, Lis, look!  They're adding a new character to Itchy &amp;
       Scratchy!  [reads] Poochie the dog?!
 Lisa: [unfooled] Adding a new character is often a desperate attempt to
       boost low ratings.
  Roy: Yo, yo!  How's it hangin' everybody!
Marge: Morning, Roy!
Homer: Yeah, hi, Roy.
-- Rim shot, "The Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Poochie Show"

Homer reads that they are having open casting for the dog's voice.
Lisa encourages him to try out, since he has a funny voice.  He denies
this.

 Bart: Haven't you ever listened to yourself on a tape recorder?
Homer: I prefer to listen to Cheap Trick.
-- Or Grand Funk Railroad, "The Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Poochie Show"

Bart holds up a tape recorder and asks his Dad to say something.  He
does so, affecting a "smooth deejay" voice.  He is shocked at what he
hears.

I don't sound like that, do I?  Oh... I don't like having such a
hilarious voice.
-- Homer, "The Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Poochie Show"

Bart, however, is optimistic about Homer's chances at stardom.

Somewhat later, the voice auditions are going on.  First up: Otto.

 Otto: [deridingly] Whoa-ho!  A talking dog!  [chuckles] What were you
       guys smokin' when you came up with that?
Cohen: [peeved] We were eating rotisserie chicken.
-- "The Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Poochie Show"

The show goes on.

 Otto: [in his traditional fashion] Ruff, ruff.  I'm Poochie, the
       rockin' dog!
Myers: You're perfect!  In fact, you're better than perfect!  Next to
       you, perfection is crap!
 Troy: Ruff, ruff!  I'm Poochie, the rocking dog!  Hi, I'm Troy McClure.
       You may remember me from such cartoons as "Christmas Ape" and
       "Christmas Ape Goes to Summer Camp".
Myers: You're even better than this guy!  [to Otto] Take a hike, you
       bum.
 Otto: [moans]
-- Easy come, easy go, "The Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Poochie Show"

Homer: [clears throat] Ruff, ruff!  I'm Poochie, the rockin' dog!
Myers: Now, that's just bad.  You've got no attitude, you're barely
       outrageous, and I don't know what you're in, but it's not my
       face.  Next!
Homer: [angry] Oh, no attitude, eh?  Not in your face, huh?  Well, you
       can cram it with walnuts, ugly!
Myers: That's it!  That's the Poochie attitude, do that again!
Homer: Huh?  I can't, I don't remember what I did.
Myers: Then you don't get the job.  Next!
Homer: [sarcastically] Oh, I don't get the job, do I?  We-ell boo-hoo!
       I don't get to be a cartoon dog!
Myers: That's it, you've got the job!
Homer: [still sarcastic] Oh, now I've got the job, huh?  [quietly] Oh,
       thank you.
-- Homer's audition, "The Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Poochie Show"

[End of Act I, Time: 9:20]

Next up for Homer: a recording session.

She smells sheep smells by the sheet shtore.
-- Homer's voice check, "The Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Poochie Show"

A lady in the studio tells him to relax.  She introduces herself: June
Bellamy, the voice of Itchy &amp; Scratchy.  Homer is amazed and amused
that a woman does those voices.

Homer: How'd you get to be so good?
 June: Oh, just experience I suppose.  I started out as Roadrunner.
       [as Roadrunner] Meep!
Homer: You mean "meep-meep"?
 June: No, they only paid me to say it once, then they doubled it up on
       the soundtrack.  [to herself] Cheap bastards.
-- "The Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Poochie Show"

Myers gives them their scripts.

Homer: Is this cartoon going on the air live?
 June: No, Homer.  Very few cartoons are broadcast live, it's a terrible
       strain on the animators' wrists.
-- Fighting cartoon urban legends, "The Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Poochie Show"

Homer and Poochie are the toast of cartoon fandom.  Poochie appears
everywhere, even in a Kwik-E-Mart sales display (saying "Brillo Pads
98c", courtesy of Apu).

Homer and June make a personal appearance at "The Android's Dungeon",
which is overflowing with cartoon cognoscenti, including Doug,
Benjamin, and Gary, the nerds from Homer's college days.

 Doug: In episode 2F09, when Itchy plays Scratchy's skeleton like a
       xylophone, he strikes the same rib twice in succession, yet he
       produces two clearly different tones.  I mean, what are we to
       believe, that this is some sort of a [the three nerds chuckle]
       magic xylophone or something?  Boy, I really hope somebody got
       fired for that blunder.
 June: Uh, well, uh...
Homer: I'll field that one.  Let me ask you a question.  Why would a
       man whose shirt says "Genius at Work" spend all of his time
       watching a children's cartoon show?
 Doug: [embarrassed pause] I withdraw my question.  [starts eating a
       candy bar]
-- First William Shatner, now Homer Simpson...,
      "The Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Poochie Show"

Database: On the "Itchy &amp; Scratchy" CD-ROM, is there a way to get out of
          the dungeon without using the wizard key?
   Homer: What the hell are you talking about?
    June: You're a lifesaver, Homer, I can't deal with these hardcore
          fans!
-- If you can't stand the heat, stay out of a.t.s,

CBG: [clears throat] Your attention, please.
Fan: Uh, in episode...
CBG: Your attention, please!
-- Will we ever shut up?, "The Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Poochie Show"

CBG: Mr. Simpson will now be autographing 8x10 glossies of Poochie, ONE
     per customer.  Please form a line.  There will be no cutting.  I'm
     talking to you, Mr. Cutter.
      [later...]
CBG: [cutting through]  Pardon me, look out, pardon me, excuse me, hot
     soup...  Hi.  Kindly make one out to me, and three out to my friend
     of the same name.
-- Some of life's greatest mysteries,
      "The Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Poochie Show"

The big day has arrived.  For the first episode of the new show, Our
Favorite Family has invited many of their friends and acquaintances to
watch.

You know, Poochie's based on me...
-- Barney Gumble, "The Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Poochie Show"

Jasper: Is this seat taken, little girl?
  Bart: I'm not a girl!  Are you blind?
Jasper: Yes.
-- Touche!  "The Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Poochie Show"

Krusty appears on-screen, dressed up for the occasion, against a dark
background, only lit by a dim spotlight.

Krusty: Once in a great while, we are privileged to experience a
        television event so extraordinary, it becomes part of our shared
        heritage.
         [picture of astronaut on the moon, against American flag]
        1969: Man walks on the moon.
         [picture of astronaut about to swing on the moon]
        1971: Man walks on the moon... again.
         [pictures stop]
        Then, for a long time, nothing happened.  Until tonight.
-- Slow century, indeed, "The Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Poochie Show"

Krusty gives the signal, and a packed audience of kids cheer the
arrival of the Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Poochie show.

Thus begins "The Beagle Has Landed."  Itchy &amp; Scratchy are driving
together.  They pass signs reading "Fireworks Factory-2 Miles", then
"1 Mile", then "1/2 Mile", when they pass by the surfer dog.

   Itchy: Look, Scratchy, it's our new friend, Poochie.
Scratchy: What's that name again?  I forgot.
-- Rub it into the audience's heads,
      "The Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Poochie Show"

Poochie introduces himself in an obnoxious rap.

Scratchy: Ooh, Poochie is one outrageous dude.
   Itchy: He's totally in my face.
-- "The Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Poochie Show"

Poochie then proceeds to a guitar "solo", driving the show further
from its tracks and into some new "see how Poochie rocks" farce.

When are they going to get to the fireworks factory?  [starts sobbing]
-- Milhouse, just like after a long division,
      "The Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Poochie Show"

  Moe: Can somebody tell me what the hell is going on?  Midge, help me
       out here.
Homer: Quiet!  You're missing the jokes!
-- I certainly am, "The Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Poochie Show"

The cartoon continues, as Poochie capers about in a proactive and
outrageous fashion, including skateboarding and basketball -- both at
once.

Poochie: [hands out his hand to Scratchy for a high-five] Catch you on
         the flip side, dudemeisters. [Scratchy extends his arm --
         Poochie withdraws his] NOT!
         Hey, kids, always recycle...  [screams] to the extreme!  Bust
         it!
          [he drives away in the sunset, past the fireworks factory]
-- And thus endeth the cartoon, "The Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Poochie Show"

Dismay.  "That stunk!" says Nelson, which seems to be the general
opinion, although everyone else is too tactful to say it in Homer's
presence.  People begin filing out.

 Ned: Homer, I can honestly say that was the best episode of "Impy &amp;
      Chimpy" I've ever seen!
Carl: Yeah, you should be very proud, Homer, you, uh... got a beautiful
      home here.
-- High praise for... "The Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Poochie Show"

Nelson punches Bart on his way out, and soon the living room is empty.

Homer: So, it was pretty okay, huh?
 Bart: Mom, can we go to bed without dinner?
Marge: Yes we can.
        [they rush upstairs, quickly followed by three bangs of slammed
        doors]
-- Family support, "The Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Poochie Show"

Homer: Well, at least I liked it.  Didn't I?
Brain: Oh, you don't want to know what I really think.  Now look sad
       and say "D'oh".
Homer: [sadly] D'oh...
-- The harshest critic, "The Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Poochie Show"

[End of Act II, Time: 14:42]

Breakfast the next morning.  Homer is wallowing in self-pity, but Lisa
tries to give him solace by telling him that Poochie was "a soulless
by-product of committee thinking."

 Lisa: You can't be cool just by spouting off a bunch of worn-out
       buzzwords.
 Bart: Don't have a cow, Lis!
Marge: Bart's right.  Let's none of us have a cow.
-- "The Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Poochie Show"

Adds Marge, "All that matters is that the fans of the shows liked it."

In the Android's Dungeon...

CBG: Last night's "Itchy &amp; Scratchy" was, without a doubt, the worst
     episode ever.  Rest assured that I was on the Internet within
     minutes, registering my disgust throughout the world.
-- He must be an AOLoser, "The Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Poochie Show"

Bart: Hey, I know it was great, but what right do you have to complain?
 CBG: As a loyal viewer, I feel they owe me.
Bart: What?  They're giving you thousands of hours of entertainment for
      free.  What could they possibly owe you?  If anything, you owe
      them.
 CBG: [pauses]  Worst episode ever.
-- "The Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Poochie Show"

On "My Two Cents", Kent Brockman also pans the show's new direction.

Far be it from me to gloat at another's downfall, but I have a feeling
that no children are gonna be crying when this puppy is put to sleep.
[laughs]
-- Kent Brockman's `My Two Cents', "The Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Poochie Show"

Krusty, watching this report, is desperate.  A meeting of the writers
and producers has been called to fix the problem.

Krusty: What the hell happened?!
  Lady: I'd attribute the product failure to fundamental shifts in our
        key demographic, coupled with the overall crumminess of Poochie.
-- Executive answers, "The Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Poochie Show"

Krusty continues with his bawling, begging the writers to do
something.

Homer comes in with his suggestions.

Homer: One, Poochie needs to be louder, angrier, and have access to a
       time machine.  Two, whenever Poochie's not onscreen, all the
       other characters should be asking "Where's Poochie"?  Three...
Myers: Great, great.  Just leave them right there on the floor on your
       way out.
-- Maybe the blingwads idea wasn't so bad after all,
      "The Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Poochie Show"

Homer suspects that all may not be well, so he eavesdrops on the
meeting.  His face takes a shocked expression.

That night, Homer tells his family what he heard.

Homer: Then they said they were going to kill Poochie off!
 Bart: [joyful] Really?!  [faking sadness] Oh, how terrible.
 Lisa: Yes.  Terrible.
-- "The Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Poochie Show"

It's not your fault, Homer.  It's those lousy writers.  They make me
madder than a... um... yak in heat!
-- Marge, "The Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Poochie Show"

Homer agrees.

Homer: I won't let them treat Poochie like dirt anymore just because
       he's the new guy.
  Roy: Right on, Mr. S!
Homer: Put a sock in it, Roy.
-- "The Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Poochie Show"

In the recording studio, Myers and company prepare to record Poochie's
death scene, but Homer refuses to stick to the script as written.
Instead, he wants to read some lines that he himself wrote.  Myers
refuses to let him, until June threatens to quit.  Finally, Myers
relents, and lets Homer read what he wants to.

 June: [in Itchy's voice] Hi, Poochie.  You look like you've got
       something to say.  Do you?
Homer: [Poochie voice] Yes, I certainly do!  [normal voice] Hello there,
       Itchy.  I know there's a lot of people who don't like me and wish
       I would go away.  I think we got off on the wrong foot.  I know I
       can come off a little proactive, and for that I'm sorry.  But if
       everyone could find a place in their hearts for the little dog
       that nobody wanted, I know we can make them laugh and cry until
       we grow old together.
-- "The Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Poochie Show"

"..aaand cut!"  The writers and producers applaud Homer's sentiments.

Some time later, the latest "I&amp;S&amp;P" episode is about to air.

Now kids, I know you loved the old Poochie, but the new one is going to
be better than ten Super Bowls!  I don't want to oversell it, judge for
yourselves.
-- Homer, "The Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Poochie Show"

At an ice sculpture contest, Itchy begins cutting into Scratchy with a
chainsaw.  Suddenly, Poochie wanders by.

  Itchy: Hi, Poochie.  You look like you've got something to say.  Do
         you?
Poochie: Yes, I certainly do!
         [Roger Myers' voice] I have to go now. My planet needs me.
          [the cel with Poochie on it is crudely moved upwards]
          [some crudely-scrawled titles move up, stating "Note: Poochie
          died on the way back to his home planet"]
   Bart: Wow, Poochie came from another planet?
   Lisa: Uh, I guess...
-- "The Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Poochie Show"

Homer is shocked to have been double-crossed.

Krusty: Poochie's dead!  [laughs]
         [children in the audience cheer loudly]
        Well kids, we all know that sometimes when cartoon characters
        die, they're back again the very next week.  That's why I'm
        presenting this sworn affidavit the Poochie will never, ever,
        ever return!
Lawyer: This document conforms to all applicable laws and statutes.
         [kids cheer]
-- Never feer Poochie: The Next Generation,
      "The Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Poochie Show"

Bart and Lisa are cheering too, but they hide it (badly) from their
father.

 Bart: Tough break, Dad.  I guess people just weren't ready for Poochie.
       Maybe in a few years.
  Roy: Good news, everybody. I'm moving into my own apartment with two
       sexy ladies.
Marge: Oh, then I guess this is good-bye, Roy.  Maybe we'll see you in a
       few years.
-- Until he gets his own show on Fo-ox!,
      "The Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Poochie Show"

Well, I guess I learned my lesson.  The thing is, I lost creative
control of the project.  And I forgot to ask for any money.  Well, live
and learn.
-- Homer, no longer the money-driven workaholic he once was,
      "The Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Poochie Show"

Later, Bart and Lisa are in front of the tube, watching a new Itchy &amp;
Scratchy episode, back to its traditional form.

Itchy &amp; Scratchy are doing a William Tell act.  Scratchy is
understandably nervous, but is relieved that the arrow strikes the
exact middle of the apple.  Unfortunately, it pierces the tank of
Carbolic Acid that he is standing in front of.  The acid streams out
and instantly skeletonizes the cartoon feline.

Bart: It's back to the basics, classic "Itchy &amp; Scratchy."
Lisa: We should thank our lucky stars that they're still putting on a
      program of this caliber after so many years.
       [they both stare at the tube for a while]
Bart: What else is on?
       [Lisa changes the channel, screen goes to static]
-- Switching to `3rd Rock'?, "The Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Poochie Show"

The Executive Producer credits go up over static.

[End of Act III, Time: 21:27]

 EPISODE TITLE: Homer Phobia


EPISODE SUMMARY:   {ol}

It seems Bart has found the right formula for making money, as many a
Springfield kid is in the Simpsons basement, shelling out big bucks
for the spectacular Super-Barto Jackpot Drawing.  Tennis balls,
baseballs, and the occasional apple are all stuffed into the dryer
machine, today's boy's cheap alternative to a drawing machine.

Come on, cantaloup!
-- Milhouse, the unknown gambler, "Homer's Phobia"

But all dryer has its limits, and this one starts rattling wildly out
of control.  Bart leans over the dryer to reach the "Off" button, but
doesn't succeed.  The dryer is pulling the gas conduct as far as it
can go, and it quickly snaps, turning into more of a flame-thrower.
The kids scale the stairs in terror.

No refunds, force majeure, read the back of your tickets.
-- Bart, "Homer's Phobia"

After a visit from the Springfield Gas Company, Homer examines his
bill $for 900, which he decides they'll have to pay for with the
retirement fund.  Said fund is a huge bottle of pennies that Homer has
immense trouble carrying. He drops it outside and the bottle plunges
through the front lawn.

[to the hole] Hello? [echo] China?  A little help?
-- Homer, "Homer's Phobia"

Marge: Well I never thought it would come to this, but I guess we'll
       have to sell Grandma's Civil War doll.
 Lisa: Oh Mom, are you sure you want to sell a family heirloom to pay
       the gas bill? I mean, what would your Grandma say?
Marge: I'm sure she'd be proud that her descendants had piping hot tap
       water and plenty of warm, dry underwear.
Homer: That is so true.
-- Dry underwears: this century's greatest achievement, "Homer's Phobia"

At the mall, the family has arrived to sell the doll to the
"Cockamamie's" antique store.

Skinner is looking at political campaign buttons.

Skinner: Hmm.  These campaign buttons are all partisan.  Don't you have
         any neutral ones? "May the better man win?" "Let's have a good,
         clean election?" That sort of thing?
   Lady: Uh, no, but we do have some old shirt buttons.  They're kinda
         kooky and fun!
Skinner: Missy, you just talked yourself right out of a sale.
-- Skinner, the more vocal consumer, "Homer's Phobia"

In another part of the store, Lisa is looking at some items, when Bart
shows off what he's found.

 Bart: [walking on pogo stilts]  Hey, Lis, check it out: pogo stilts.
       These were banned in all 50 states.
        [Bart's foot slips; one pogo springs into the air and hits
        something]
Homer: [off screen]  Ow!!  Ohh!  What happened?
-- Helpless victims of freak accidents, "Homer's Phobia"

Lisa and Bart spot a huge, elementary 50s robot.

Lisa: Wow!  An actual robot from the movie "Clank Clank! You're Dead!"
      Ooh, think of how awful it would be for the poor midget inside.
Bart: Aw, boo hoo.  That's what they get paid for.
       [they walk away; the door opens, revealing a skeleton]
-- Correction: what they got paid for, "Homer's Phobia"

Marge and Homer look at things when Marge spots something interesting.

Marge: [gasps]  Oh, Homer, look!  Look, a TV Guide owned by Jackie O.
 John: Oh, you should see the crossword puzzle.  She thought that Mindy
       lived with "Mark."
Homer: Give her a break!  Her husband was killed!
-- "Homer's Phobia"

The clerk introduces himself as John.

Marge: I have something that I'd like to sell.
 John: Please tell me it's your hair.
Marge: [flattered, giggles] No.  It's an heirloom my grandmother passed
       down to me. A very rare, old figurine from the Civil War.
 Lisa: Please don't construe our ownership of this as an endorsement of
       slavery.
 John: [eyes the doll] Hmm.  Well see, here's the thing on this.  It's a
       Johnny Reb bottle, early 1970s, one of the J &amp; R Whiskey
       "Liquor Lads."  Two books of green stamps, if I'm not mistaken.
Marge: Oh, no.  Oh, no, no, no, no.  It's a very, very old figurine.
 John: No, it's a liquor bottle.  [untwists a cap from the bottle]  See?
       [pours himself some whiskey and drinks it]
       That'll make your bull run.
Marge: Well... I guess it'll always be a monument to Grandma's secret
       drinking problem.
-- "Homer's Phobia"

Homer comments that although this bottle may not be worth much, it's
still better than the junk this store is selling.

Fifty bucks for a toy?  No kid is worth that!
-- Homer's value of children, "Homer's Phobia"

 John: But this is the Rex Mars Atomic Discombobulator.  Don't you just
       love the graphics on this box?
Homer: No.  How can you love a box, or a toy or graphics?  You're a grown
       man.
 John: It's camp!
        [Homer stares nonplussed]
       The tragically ludicrous?  The ludicrously tragic?
Homer: Oh, yeah.  Like when a clown dies.
 John: Well, sort of.  But I mean more like inflatable furniture or
       "Last Supper" TV trays, or even this bowling shirt.
        [John is wearing Homer's "Pin Pals" t-shirt]
       Can you believe somebody gave this to goodwill?
        [Marge sneaks away]
-- Just because it's got your name and picture on it doesn't mean...,
      "Homer's Phobia"

Homer: And that kinda stuff is worth money?
 John: Boy howdy!
Homer: Man, you should come over to our place.  It's full of valuable
       worthless crap.
 John: Well, if you're inviting me over...
Homer: I practically insist!  Shall we say five o'clock?  The snacking
       hour?
 John: My heart is palpatating!  Hoo hoo!
-- He is wearing your shirt, anyway, "Homer's Phobia"

At home, to prepare for John's visit, Marge draws smiling faces on
crackers. "Pimento nose, and voila! Mommy's patented Happy-Cracker
Snack Platter." The doorbell rings, and while Marge is away, Maggie
grabs the can of cheese and fills her mouth with it.

Marge answers the door, and John is there with a camera.  He sings
"Ding-dong!" along with the doorbell in a chipper way.  Enter the TV
room.

 John: Oh man, you weren't kidding about this place!  Well, I just love it!
       [takes pictures]
Homer: Do I know you?
-- Short term memory, "Homer's Phobia"

John surveys the house, taking pictures.

John: Oh, the color scheme and the rabbit ears!  And the two point three
      children, I mean, where's the Hi-C?
Lisa: [walking in, holding a tray]  Hi-C and fluffernutters!
John: Oh!  And pearls on a little girl!  It's a fairy tale!
-- If you say so, "Homer's Phobia"

In the kitchen, John admires the curtains.

 John: Oh, I've got the exact same curtains, only in my bathroom.
       Didn't you just die when you found these?
Marge: Not really.  They just had corn on them.  Kitchen...  Corn...
 John: Oh!
        [slaps Marge on the arm in an "Oh You!" manner]
        [Marge snickers and taps John back]
        [Bart tries and imitate them, more-or-less punching Homer]
Homer: Oww!  Why you little...!
        [strangles Bart]
 Bart: Aaah!  Dad!  Dad!  Company!  Company!
Homer: [stops] Oh.  I'll just be another minute, John.  Have a seat.
       [resumes strangling]
-- Company rules, "Homer's Phobia"

John looks at the Simpsons' vinyl collection.  Homer asks him if his
records have "camp" value, and John thinks they do and comments, "You
yourself are worth a bundle, Homer! Why I could wrap a bow around you
and slap on a price tag." Homer laughs and starts dancing with John to
a record.

The rest of the family watch from inside the kitchen.  The kids
comment on his love of Itchy &amp; Scratchy -- and in Bart's case, of toy
robots. Marge comments that Homer's "certainly taken a shine to him."
To prove her right, both are laughing together in the living room.

The next morning, Homer, enjoying John's company, decides one day to
invite him and his wife over for drinks. But Marge doesn't think he's
married.

Homer: That John is the greatest guy in the world.  We've gotta have him
       and his wife over for drinks sometime.
Marge: Hmm, I don't think he's married, Homer.
Homer: Oh, a swinging bachelor, eh?  Well, there's lots of foxy ladies
       out there.
Marge: Homer, didn't John seem a little... festive to you?
Homer: Couldn't agree more.  Happy as a clam.
Marge: [insisting]  He prefers the company of men!
Homer: Who doesn't?
Marge: Homer, listen carefully.  John is a ho - mo...
Homer: Right.
Marge: ... sexual.
Homer: [pause] Aaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!
-- "Homer's Phobia"

[End of Act One.  Time: 6:29]

Homer: Ohmygod Ohmygod Ohmygod!  Oh my god!  I danced with a gay!  Marge,
       Lisa, promise me you won't tell anyone.  [shaking Lisa]  Promise
       me!!
Marge: You're being ridiculous.
Homer: Am I, Marge?  Am I?  Think of the property values.  Now we can never
       say only straight people have been in this house.
-- "Homer's Phobia"

Marge: I'm very sorry you feel that way, because John invited us all out
       for a drive today, and we're going.
Homer: Woah-ho-ho, not me!  And not because John's gay, but because he's a
       sneak.  He should at least have the good taste to mince around and
       let everyone know that he's... that way.
Marge: What on Earth are you talking about?
Homer: You know me, Marge.  I like my beer cold, my TV loud and my
       homosexuals fa-laming.
-- "Homer's Phobia"

From outside can be heard a car horn, playing "Over the Rainbow."  Of
course, it's nobody else than John himself, who's brought with him the
Rex Mars Atomic Discombobulator.  Homer peeks out the window curtains,
and John greets him with a friendly Discombobulator "zzzzzap!"

Homer: I'm not setting foot outside this house until that man is gone!
 Bart: Oh, Dad!  You are the living end!
        [Homer narrows his eyes at Bart]
-- The first signs are always subtle, "Homer's Phobia"

The whole family -- Dad excepted -- hops into John's car, complete
with pine freshener and zebra-like interior.  Bart is seated next to a
very weird robot, which kinda looks like a cross between Santa Claus,
a cash register, and that alien creature from tonight's 3am horror
movie.

Bart: Hey, where'd that cool creepy Santa come from?
John: Japan.  Except over there they call him "Annual Gift Man" and he
      lives on the moon.
-- "Homer's Phobia"

John drives the family through the more tinsel part of Springfield...

John: And that's where Kent Brockman was caught cheating in the
      Springfield marathon.
 All: Ooh...
       [passing in front of a plumbing supplies store]
John: And there's where Lupe Velez bought the toilet she drowned in.
 All: Ohhhh!
-- So many commonly ignored sights, "Homer's Phobia"

At the Sha-Boom Ka-Boom cafe, the group has lunch.

Bart: That was a killer tour, man!
Lisa: I never realized how many celebrities humuliated themselves right
      in our backyard.
-- "Homer's Phobia"

John contemplates how this makes him "sick in a wonderful, wonderful
way."  At this moment, a familiar figure walks by.

Smithers: John!
    John: Uhh, oh, Waylon!  I'd like you to meet the Simpsons!
Smithers: I know the Simpsons.  [sotto voce]  So this is your sick
          mother?
    John: Don't do this to me, Waylon.
-- "Homer's Phobia"

The family's home, and Homer is literally waiting up, ready to spew
more venomous homophobia.  Marge tries to calm him down, but to no
effect. His worries grow worse when Bart shows him John's
Discombobulator he got.

Bart: Hey Dad, look what I got!  [points the gun to him]  Zzap!  Zzap!
        [Homer looks worriedly at Bart]
       Zzap!  Zzap!
-- The clues are adding up, "Homer's Phobia"

Homer watches TV and then Bart strolls by him in a Hawaiian shirt.

Homer: Baart!  Where'd you get that shirt?
 Bart: I dunno.  Came out of the closet.
Homer: Uhhh... huh.
-- When one's mind plays tricks..., "Homer's Phobia"

At the dinner table...

I hope you all saved room, because I made your favorite dessert.
Store-bought snack cakes -- both kinds.
-- Marge's secret family recipe finally unveiled, "Homer's Phobia"

Homer examines Bart's selection between pink Snoballs and Cupcakes
expectingly. He grits his teeth worriedly when Bart moves his hand for
the Snoballs, then smiles when he reaches for the cupcakes. Back and
forth goes Bart's hand -- and Homer's gestures. Finally, Bart picks
the Snoball. Homer goes mad.

In bed, Homer chews on his pillow, and Marge gets him to tell her
what's wrong.

Homer: Marge, the boy was wearing a hawaiian shirt.
Marge: So?
Homer: There's only two kind of guys who wear those shirts: gay guys and
       big, fat party animals.  [sad] And Bart doesn't look like a big,
       fat party animal to me...
Marge: So, if you wore a Hawaiian shirt, it wouldn't be gay?
Homer: Right.  Thank you.
-- "Homer's Phobia"

Homer blames it all on his wife.

Do you have to be so effeminate around the boy?
-- Homer to Marge, "Homer's Phobia"

Marge decides that if there is actually a problem with Bart worth
worrying over, it must be that he's not spending time with his dad.

The next day, Homer walks down the stairs, humming along to "Shoop
Shoop Song (It's In His Kiss)", which is indeed playing in the house.
All smiling, he's all ready to spend some time with his son when,
horror of all horrors, he finds him dancing on that song, wearing
some huge black wig with a pink bow in it.  Could it get any worse?

A short trip to the kitchen shows the source of all evil, chatting
with Marge.

 John: ...and Helen Lovejoy, sure, she looks blonde, but I've heard
       cuffs and collar don't match, if you get my drift.
Marge: I don't, but I loved hearing it!
-- Old gossip ain't what it used to be, "Homer's Phobia"

Homer takes action on the intruder.

Homer: [to John] Yyyou!  I should've known!
 John: Well, good morning, sunshine.
Marge: Homer!  John brought us cactus candy!
Homer: Look, John, you seem like a perfectly nice guy and all, just stay
       the hell away from my family.
 John: Well, now you don't get any candy. [pauses]  Naw, that's cruel.
       Take a teensy piece.
-- "Homer's Phobia"

 John: Homer, what have you got against gays?
Homer: You know!  It's not... usual.  If there was a law, it'd be
       against it!
Marge: Oh Homer, please!  You're embarrassing yourself.
Homer: No I'm not, Marge!  They're embarrasing me.  They're embarrassing
       America.  They turned the Navy into a floating joke.  They ruined
       all our best names like Bruce, and Lance, and Julian.  Those were
       the toughest names we had!  Now they're just, uh...
 John: Queer?
Homer: Yeah, and that's another thing!  I resent you people using that
       word.  That's our word for making fun of you!  We need it!!  Well
       I'm taking back our word, and I'm taking back my son!
-- "Homer's Phobia"

The case requires immediate treatment, so Homer drives away with the
boy.

Homer: Don't worry, boy.  We're gonna set you straight.  By tomorrow
       morning, you'll be a regular Burt Reynolds.
 Bart: What are you talking about, Homer?  Where are we going?
Homer: Just a couple of good old-fashioned manly places.
       [puts his arm around Bart] Father and son!
Brain: [thinking]  You're leaving the arm there too long!  You wanna
       make it worse?
        [Homer quickly yanks his arm off Bart's shoulder]
Brain: No, no!  He'll know you're on to him!  Quick, shake his hand!
        [Homer does as his brain told him]
Homer: Just remember, son, no matter what happens, I'll always love you.
Brain: As??  As??
Homer: [yanking hand away] As a father!  A father!  Regular father.
-- "Homer's Phobia"

Homer sets up a lawn chair somewhere between freeways and puts Bart in
it.

 Bart: What am I supposed to do here?
Homer: Nothing.  Just sit.  I'll be back.
        [walks away, revealing a giant "Laramie Slims" billboard,
        featuring a girl in lingerie having a pillow fight with another
        girl in a skimpy shirt and panties]
        [time passess...]
Homer: Well, it's been two hours.  How do you feel?
 Bart: I dunno.  I kinda want a cigarette.
Homer: That's a good start.  Let's get you a pack.  What's your brand?
 Bart: Anything slim!
Homer: [grunts]  [to himself] Okay, that didn't work.
-- All good plans have cracks, "Homer's Phobia"
  
Homer goes back to the drawing board: to make a boy into a man, you
need the apex of manhood and virility as your environment.  Something
like, I dunno... a steel mill?

Homer introduces Bart to a big man in overalls and a hard hat.

 Homer: Bart, I want you to shake hands with -- what's your name, fella?
Roscoe: Roscoe.
 Homer: Roscoe here runs this mill.  He's gonna show us around to let you
        get a first-hand look at real all-American Joes doing what they do
        best.
  Bart: Why the hell would I wanna see that?
 Homer: [sotto voce] You'll thank me on your wedding night.
-- Not if he divorces twice, he won't, "Homer's Phobia"

A bunch of men are working in the mill when Roscoe, Homer and Bart
walk in.

Roscoe: [to all]  Hey!  Listen up!  I want all of youse to say hello to
        the Simpsons.
   All: [waving in a cliche, sissy-like attitude]  Hello-o.
 Homer: [gasps]  Has the whole world gone insane?!
Worker: [sissy-like] Stand still, there's a spark in your hair!
Worker: Get it!  Get it!
 Homer: [whimpers]
         [another guy walks past Homer holding a vat of hot steel in hot
         pants]
Worker: Hot stuff, comin' through!
 Homer: [screams]
  Bart: Dad, why'd you bring me to a gay steel mill?
 Homer: [frightened] I don't know!  This is a NIGHTMARE! YOU'RE ALL
        SICK!
Worker: [waving his hand] Oh be nice!
 Homer: Oh!  My son doesn't stand a chance!  The whole world's gone gay!
         [a whistle goes off]
        Oh my god!  What's happening now?
Roscoe: We work hard.  We play hard.  [pulls a chain]
         ["Everybody Dance Now" starts playing]
-- Oh, that ain't good news, "Homer's Phobia"

Suddenly, a hi-tech disco ball slides down and the entire mill turns
into a night club called "The Anvil", with smoke and dance stands and
everything, with every worker dancing along "Everybody Dance Now."
Homer slowly backs away, frightened, hiding Bart's eyes.

[End of Act Three.  Time: 13:45]

At Moe's...

 Homer: ... and the entire steel mill was gay.
   Moe: Where you been, Homer?  The entire steel industry is gay.  Eh,
        aerospace, too, and the railroads. And you know what else?
        Broadway.
-- The world today, "Homer's Phobia"

Barney: I always hoped Bart would grow up just like us.  What happened?
   Moe: Aw, it ain't no mystery.  The whole modern world's got a
        swishifying effect on kids today.  And their MTVs and their diet
        sodas ain't gonna set 'em straight, neither.  You gotta do it
        yourself, Homer, and you gotta do it fast.
 Homer: But what would turn Bart into a man fast?  You have to think for
        me!
   Moe: Well, let's see now, uh, time was you sent a boy off to war.
        Shooting a man'd fix 'em right up.  But there's not even any wars
        no more, thank you very much, Warren Christopher!
Barney: Hey, better yet, Bart could shoot a deer!  That's like shooting a
        beautiful man.
   Moe: Hey, he's right, Homer.  After the boy bags a deer, all the diet
        sodas in the world won't turn him back.  And you just sit right
        back and watch the grandchildren roll in.
-- Easy solutions to life-threatening problems, "Homer's Phobia"

At the Springfield Mall, Homer, Barney and Moe, dressed in hunting
garb, emerge from the Hunting Supplies Store with an assortment of
hunting supplies.  Homer sees his family hanging out with John, with
Bart playing a video game.  Homer growls angrily, and goes fetch his
son.

Homer: Stand aside, Marge, I'm taking the boy deer hunting.  He's going to
       grow up straight for once!
Marge: What?!  You never went hunting before, and you're perfectly
       straight.
Homer: Oh yeah?  How long since you've had a baby?
 Lisa: But Dad, it's barbaric.  How does killing a deer make you more of a
       man?
Homer: It just does.  Name me one gay Indian.
-- "Homer's Phobia"

 John: Uh oh.  Something's gonna die.
Homer: Butt out, Buttinsky.  What would you know about hunting?
 John: I know this much.  I wouldn't wear that hideous hat.  Here, take
       this one.  It was worn by Yale Summers in Daktari.
Homer: Hang on to it, Toy-Boy!  You might need it when it starts raining
       naked ladies!
-- "Homer's Phobia"

Homer grabs his kid, and sets off for hunting grounds.

In Moe's truck, the boys sum up the plan to its victim.

Barney: Today, you're gonna be a man, Bart.
  Bart: You guys going to teach me to drive?
   Moe: [to Barney] Oh, yeah, let a twinkle-toes drive Betsy.  Right.
 Homer: [chuckling nervously]  No, boy.  You can't drive.  You're only
        ten.  You're going hunting.
   Moe: You ever been hunting before, there, Barty?
  Bart: Nope.  Something about a bunch of guys alone together in the
        woods... seems kinda gay.
         [awkward silence]
 Homer: That is a very immature attitude, young man.
-- You tell him, Homer, "Homer's Phobia"

The virile campers reach their destination.

Remember, guys, the truck only holds six carcasses, so don't shoot
nothing but trophy bucks, huh?
-- Moe, "Homer's Phobia"

But as the day goes by, everyone sits on rocks waiting for deer, while
Barney drinks beer, the empty cans multiplying as the hours go by.
Late at night, one has to admit that the whole exercice was pointless.

Barney: Aw, we should've just stayed at the bar and shot some rats.
   Moe: Hey, those ain't your rats, Barn.
-- "Homer's Phobia"

Homer isn't ready to call it quits yet, as the whole idea was for Bart
to shoot a deer -- not merely wait for one to appear.  But since the
lad's deep asleep already, there's no much point in pursuing this.

Homer scoops Bart into his arms and the quartet drives home

  Moe: Come on, don't take this so hard, Homer.  You still got that
       other kid, uh... Lisa.  Let's, uh, take her out hunting tomorrow;
       make her into a man.
Homer: Aw, she'd never go.  She's a vegetarian.
  Moe: Oh, geez!  Homer, geez!  You and Marge ain't cousins, are you?
-- As least the tots have four fingers, "Homer's Phobia"

Homer scolds himself for being a lousy dad.  However, Moe spots a sign
advertising live reindeers for a Santa's village. "Cheer up, Homer!
Christmas is coming early this year."

Despite the sign "Closed for Season," Moe drives on, breaking the gate
and entering Santa's Village.

Meanwhile, at home...

John: Did he say where they were going?
Lisa: No.  They were just going to find a deer and make Bart shoot it.
John: Deer?  Ha!  Not around here.  They all migrated north when the
      state park converted to Astroturf.
-- "Homer's Phobia"

John continues: "The only thing around here that's even close to deer
is..."

Yup, reindeer.  The hunting group breaks into the reindeer's pen.

Homer: Hey, boy, wake up.  Your old man found some deer.
 Bart: Huh?  You did?
 Bart: Hey, wait, man.  Those are reindeer!
Homer: Yep.  And it's your shot, son.
        [hands Bart the gun]
 Bart: What?  I'm not gonna shoot a reindeer in a pen.
        [Moe nudges Homer]
Homer: Come on, boy.  Be a sport and kill Blitzen, okay?
 Bart: [pleading] Dad! [starts whimpering]
  Moe: Oh criminy.  Here come the waterworks.
Homer: Bart, I'm gonna turn my back, and when I turn around, I wanna see
       a whole PILE of dead reindeer!
-- "Homer's Phobia"

They all turn their backs and block their ears.  Moments later, a bang
goes off. Homer congratulates his son, but Bart replies he's not even
fired a shot.  Seems the sound is one of antlers colliding together,
as the whole reindeer flock is acting angrily.

Hey, they're going nuts, like in those nature films!
-- Barney, National Geographic subscriber for life, "Homer's Phobia"

"Must be mating season," Moe adds.  The reindeer line up against
Homer, Bart, Moe and Barney, who all scream. Immediately, Barney and
Moe find hiding places, but Homer's stuck in the middle.  As a father,
he protects his son by raising him in the air.

 Bart: No, don't!  You have to protect yourself!
Homer: Son, there comes a time in every father's life when he must...
        [a reindeer rushes him]
       Argh!
        [a reindeer from the other side of Homer rushes him too]
       Urgh!
 Bart: Dad, are you hurt?
Homer: Just... my bones... and organs.
-- And whatever's left inbetween, "Homer's Phobia"

The reindeer keep knocking Homer around when the attack is interrupted
by the toy-keyboard sound of "Jingle Bells."  The reindeer back away
as this thing nears closer to a beaten up Homer, deadpanning "Ho ho
ho..." Yup, it's the mechanical Santa, Mr. "Annual Gift Man" in person.

Homer: Look, Bart!  It's Santa Claus!
        [robot fires two missiles, which makes reindeer back-up]
 Bart: Woah, it's Santa all right.  And he is kicking ass!
-- "Homer's Phobia"

All the reindeer run away.

Homer: It's a miracle!
 John: [holding the Santa remote] No, ultrasuede is a miracle. This is
       just good timing.
Marge: Oh, Homie, I'm so glad you're safe.  [hugs him]
       Hmm, you feel softer than before.
Homer: [in pain] I've been tenderized.
-- "Homer's Phobia"

  Bart: How'd you know that thing would work?
  John: Well the sound is just brutal, and I figured reindeer would
        naturally be afraid of their cruel master Santa Claus.  I mean,
        wouldn't you be?  Ha!
Barney: Is it okay to come out now, Mr. Gay Man?  Sir?
   Moe: I'll do anything you say!  Anything!
-- "Homer's Phobia"

All is well that ends well, as everyone heads home.  However, some
wounds will take some time to heal...

Barney: Aw, Moe, we were saved by a sissy.
   Moe: Yeah, yeah, we'll never live it down.  Oh, boy, it looks like
        it's suicide again for me.
 Homer: Hey!  We owe this guy, and I don't want you calling him a sissy.
        This guy's a fruit, and a... no, wait, wait, wait: queer, queer
        queer!  That's what you like to be called, right?
  John: Well, that or John.
  Lisa: This is about as tolerant as Dad gets so you should be
        flattered.
-- "Homer's Phobia"

Well, Homer, I won your respect, and all I had to do was save your life.
Now, if every gay man could just do the same, you'd be set.
-- John sums up the situation, "Homer's Phobia"

On the ride home, Homer delivers a long-awaited message to his son.

Homer: You know, Bart, maybe it's the concussion talking, but any way
       you choose to live your life is okay with me.
 Bart; Huh?
 Lisa: [whispering] He thinks you're gay.
 Bart: He thinks I'm gay?!
        ["Everybody Dance Now" plays on-screen]
-- So do some people on a.t.s., it seems, "Homer's Phobia"

We cut closer and closer to Bart's mystified face in accordance with
the song, which plays on as John's car drives off. The words
"Dedicated to The Steelworkers of America Keep Reaching For That
Rainbow" appear on screen as the song plays during the credits.

% Act one.  Homer, smoking a cigar, and Marge sit at the family piano, 
% singing their own version of the "All In The Family" theme.

        Homer: Oy, the way the Bee Gee's played,
        Marge: Movies John Travolta made,
        Homer: Guessing how much Elvis weighed,
Homer &amp; Marge: Those were the days!
        Marge: And you knew where you were then,
        Homer: Watching shows like "Gentle Ben",
Homer &amp; Marge: Mister, we could use a man like Sheriff Lobo again!
        Homer: Disco Duck and Fleetwood Mac,
        Marge: Coming out of my eight-track,
Homer &amp; Marge: Michael Jackson still was black, those were the days!
-- A little sing-song, ``''

% Applause, and fade out.  Of course, don't forget the usual reminder, 
% provided by a voice-over, that "The Simpsons" is filmed before a live
% studio audience.

% In the living room, Bart sits on the couch, watching TV.  Homer comes
% in from the kitchen, drinking a can of beer.

Homer: Hey there, meathead, what are you watching?
 Bart: Aw, I thought I'd check out the Warner Brothers Network.
       [On the TV, an singing and dancing amphibian similar to "Michigan
       J. Frog" appears on screen, in front of a logo similar to the "WB"

 Frog: [singing] We're proud to present on the WB, another bad show that no 
       one will see! [disgustedly walking off] Ah, I need a drink.
-- Watching TV, ``''

% Said show that no one will see, except for Bart and Homer, is about

the Clown!
-- Fun for the whole family! TV announcer, ``''

% In the movie, "Krusty" sits among a circle of clowns at the Betty Ford
% Center in the "Clown Detox Wing", baring his soul.

I went through a five-year orgy of non-stop pills, and booze, with
nothing to show for it but four Emmys and a Peabody Award! [groans]
-- Krusty the clown played by Fyvush Finkel, ``''

% Back at home with the Simpsons, Bart seems to actually like the movie.

All right!  They're going to show his disastrous marriage to Mia Farrow!
-- Bart, on Krusty, ``''

% They sure do; "Krusty" is standing in his living room in a sea of kids.

 Fyvush: Chan Ho, your mother Mia and I are getting a divorce.

-- The Krusty the Clown movie, ``''

[watching the show] Heh, heh, heh, heh!  What a bad father!
[As if on cue, Maggie walks by with a power drill in her arms, falling
onto the floor from the weight. Homer ignores this.]
-- Homer, All-American father, ``''

% From the top floor comes a familiar baritone groan; it's Lisa, practicing
% on her saxophone.

Lisa!  Knock off that racket!
-- I can't hear the bad father on TV. Homer, ``''

% Lisa calls back from the top of the stairs, holding her instrument.

 Lisa: But Dad, I'm supposed to practice an hour a day!
Homer: I'll practice you!
 Lisa: You'll practice me...what does that mean?  Is it supposed to be some
       sort of a threat?
-- Kids are getting smarter, ``''

% Lisa walks back to her room and continues wailing.  Homer growls in
% frustration. Homer asks Bart to make her stop.
% Bart murmurs in assent, and confronts Lisa, who is sitting on her bed.

Lisa: Look Bart, I have to practice my saxophone, and you can't stop me!
Bart: Oh yeah?  My dear Lisa, you are eight, and I am ten.  And in my two
      extra years on this planet, I've learned a few tricks.
      [Bart thinks for a moment, deciding which trick to use.  He opts for
      the traditional means.]
Bart: Gimmie that sax!
Lisa: No!
Bart: I said gimmie it!
Lisa: I said NO!
Bart: Gimmie it!
Lisa: No!
-- Kids, don't try this at home, ``''


% After this goes on for a while, Bart yanks the sax from her hands, and 
% Lisa watches in slow-mo terror as it flies out her window, into the
% street. It lands with a clatter, and is immediately crushed by car, a
% truck driven by Hans Moleman, and a few jumps from Nelson, accompanied
% by the usual "Ha, ha!".  Not to mention the tricycle-riding man from
% Rowan &amp; Martin's Laugh-In falling onto it.  Back inside, Lisa holds her
% beloved instrument on the family room couch, sobbing.

Homer: Aw, Lisa, it doesn't look so bad.
 Lisa: Oh yeah?
       [She turns the saxophone so both we and Homer can see that it's
       been rendered perfectly flat.]
-- ``''

Homer: Ew!  Lisa, honey, if it'll make you feel better I'll destroy
       something Bart loves.
 Bart: Hey!
Homer: Don't worry, son, if that bothers you, I'll destroy something
       Maggie loves!
       [At this, Maggie looks at Homer and clutches the power drill she's
       holding tighter.]
-- That way everyone's happy, ``''

 Lisa: Dad, you don't understand.  This saxophone is like my oldest friend.
       I've had it for as long as I can remember.
Homer: You don't remember how you got it?
 Lisa: [dejected] Nuh-uh.
Homer: Oh, well!  It all happened in 1990!  Back then, "The Artist Formerly
       Known As Prince" was currently known as "Prince".  Tracey Ullman was
       entertaining America with songs, sketches, and crudely drawn filler
       material.  And Bart was eagerly awaiting his first day of school.
-- Thank God this isn't a clip show, ``''

% Flashback, accompanied by the song "Don't Worry, Be Happy".  Bart,
% lunchbox in hand, stands at the front door as Marge gets him ready to be
% sent off to school.  Baby Lisa sits on the floor nearby, playing with
% letter blocks.  She stacks them to make the word "STAR". She tries to
% show Marge, but Marge says she's busy getting Bart ready.
% With a frustrated "hmph!" Lisa knocks the blocks over with a smack.  They
% form the word "RATS" on the floor.


Homer: Now son, on your first day of school, I'd like to pass on the words

         noogies and nipple twisters.
  Jimbo: I look forward to wailing on all of you.
-- First impressions, ``''

% The kids gulp.  In Bart's class, he and his new schoolmates sit in a

Barney: Let's never drink again.

 Homer: And we never did. [takes a swig]

 Lisa: Mom, can you tell me a story about how I got my saxophone and not
       have it turn into a story about Bart?!
Marge: Well sure, honey.  Bart had just completed his first day of school,
       and Bart...
 Lisa: Mom!
 Bart: Hey, she's just giving the public what it wants: Bart by the 
       barrelfull!
-- Well.. it WAS 1990, ``''

% Marge resumes the story after explaining that it just goes like that.
% Back in 1990, Bart is reciting the alphabet for his kindergarten teacher.

   Bart: A-B-C...uh, line?
Teacher: D!
   Bart: D-E...mmm, line?
Teacher: F, Bart.  And believe me, you'll be seeing plenty of 'em.
-- Early disencouragement, ``''

% At home, Bart lies on his bed, depressed. Marge comes in asking if
% Bart would like to read a book, or draw. Bart says he already did.
% He points to the wall, where a picture he drew hangs.  It shows Bart,
% lying on the ground, with knives stuck in him, thunderclouds overhead,
% and the word "SAD" written across the page.  Marge reacts in surprise.  
% Meanwhile, downstairs, Homer has all the lights turned out as he watches
% television.  From the TV, a certain rather strange program bathes the
% room in blue light, casting shadows all about.

TV Voice: That's damn fine coffee you got here in Twin Peaks!  And damn
          good cherry pie!
          [On the screen, a man dances with a horse under a tree, from
          which a stop light hangs.  They dance to the saxophone music being
          played.]
   Homer: Brilliant! [laughs] I have absolutely no idea what's going on.
-- Neither do we, ``''

Marge: Homer, I want you to look at this drawing Bart did!
Homer: [faking excitement, watching TV] Oh, it's beautiful!  Oh, oh, let's
       put Bart's beautiful drawing up on the fridge!
Marge: Homer, stop.  Will you please look at the drawing?
Homer: Oh, all right.  What...[looks at drawing]...aaah!!  Burn it!  Send
       it to hell!
Marge: I think we're going to have to get Bart some help.
Homer: [cringing] Get it away!
-- The horrible reality, ``''

% Later, Homer comes into Bart's room with a cap, ball, and glove.  Bart
% lies on his bed, motionless.

Homer: Bart, son?  You want to play catch?
 Bart: No.
Homer: When a boy doesn't want to play catch with his old man, something is
       seriously wrong!
  Abe: [wearing old-time baseball uniform] I'll play catch with you, son!
Homer: Get the hell out!
  Abe: I'm gone.
-- Like father, like son, ``''

% In Doctor Hibbert's office, Hibbert, who wears an outfit not unlike that
% of Mr. T, gives Bart a check-up.

Mr. Simpson, physically your son is as sound as the dollar!  I'm afraid
Bart's severe emotional dysfunction stems from a deep-seated psychological
trauma. [laughs]
-- I pity da poor boy, ``''

% With nowhere else to turn, as Marge narrates to us, the Simpsons go to
% see the school psychologist.

Dr. Pryor: Mr. and Mrs. Simpson, there's nothing to be alarmed about.  
           Public school can be intimidating to a young child,
           particularly one with as many flamboyantly homosexual
           tendencies as your son.
    Marge: Bart's gay?
Dr. Pryor: Bart?  Ah, whoo, wrong file.
           [Dr. Pryor puts a file reading "VANHOUTEN, MILHOUSE" back onto
           the rack.]
-- He thinks I'm gay? (everybody dance now!) ``''


Ah, the point I'm trying to make here is, that Bart must learn to be less
of an individual, and more a...faceless slug.
-- Top notch advice. Dr. Pryor, ``''

% With this, he looks down to see Lisa, on Marge's lap, who is busy 
% piecing together a jigsaw puzzle, depicting the Taj Mahal, on Dr. Pryor's 
% desk.

Dr. Pryor: Hm, Lisa, how old are you?
     Lisa: I am three and three eighths!
Dr. Pryor: Hm!  Lisa, if I have five apples, and I take away three apples,
           how many apples do I have left?
     Lisa: Two apples!
    Homer: Wait a minute! [counts on fingers] She's right!
-- Great Scott! ``''

Dr. Pryor: Heh, very good.  Marge, Homer, I believe your Lisa may be gifted.
    Marge: That's wonderful!  But still, can't you do anything for Bart?
    Homer: Marge, he's five, his life is over.  Lisa's the wave of
           the future!
     Lisa: Wave of the future!
Dr. Pryor: Uh huh, that's right, honey.  If you nurture her gift now, 
           there's no telling what she can do.
    Homer: Wow...just think of the possibilities!
           [In dreamland, Homer imagines Lisa winning the Nobel Prize.
    Homer: Nah!
           [In revised dreamland, Homer imagines Lisa, wearing a black
           belt, winning the Nobel Prize...for kickboxing!  With the medal
           around her neck, she kicks the official who has just presented
           it to her.]
    Homer: Hmm!
-- Disfunctionally raised, ``''

% Dr. Pryor promises them the address of a good preschool.
% At a nearby highly prestigeous-looking preschool, we see kids using 
% computers, painting, and playing a clapping game while reciting the
% digits of pi.  Marge and Homer talk with the headmaster, while Lisa sits
% nearby, crafting a horse out of clay.

Headmaster: I can assure you our preschool is of the highest quality.  Over
            seventy-five percent of our graduates go on to first grade!
     Homer: Well, our little girl has a gift, and we're willing to do what
            it takes to help her.
Headmaster: Very good.  Once we receive your six thousand dollar tuition 
            check, she's in.
     Homer: I'll give you fifty bucks.
Headmaster: Our fee is non-negotiable.
     Homer: Seventy-five!
     Marge: Look, I knew private school would be expensive, but I was hoping
            we could get a scholarship of some sort.
Headmaster: Sorry.  I don't have anything to offer you unless you're a
            member of a minority group.
     Homer: [Mexican accent] Excellente!  Muchos gracias seniorata!
Headmaster: Sorry.
     Homer: [Chinese accent] Aah-so...
-- The man of many faces, ``''

% Marge and Homer leave the preschool, taking Lisa with them.
% ``Come on, honey, I guess this is a world you'll never know.''
% Sad music accompanies our journey back into the present, where Homer
% continues to narrate the story.

Homer: Our family was suffering through its worst crisis ever.  Bart was
       miserable at school, and Lisa's gifts were going to waste.
 Bart: Uh, Homer?  It's five years later, and I'm still miserable at 
       school.
 Lisa: And my gifts are still going to waste!
Marge: And sometimes I feel so smothered by this family I just want to 
       scream until my lungs explode!!
       [The rest of the family stares at Marge for a moment.  She regains
       her composure after a deep breath.]
Marge: I'll go start dinner now. [leaves for kitchen]
Homer: You do that.
-- Getting some jitters out of the system, ``''

[End of act two.  Time: 12:19.]

% Act three.  Grandpa Simpson has come over for a visit.

Homer: Dad, what are you doing here?
  Abe: Looking for my teeth!
       [Santa's Little Helper has the false teeth in place in his mouth.]
  Abe: Gimmie those! [takes teeth] Better wash these off.  Aw, the hell with
       it. [puts teeth in mouth, dog drool and all]
-- Ewwww, ``''

Marge: Well, Grandpa, as long as you're here, we were telling a story that
       took place when Bart was five, and Lisa was three.
  Abe: Oh, I know this story!  The year was nineteen-ought-six.  The 
       President is the divine Miss Sarah Burnheart.  And all over America,
       people were doin' a dance called the "Funky Grandpa"!  [sings] Oh...
       I'm...the...[falls asleep standing up]
Marge: Ye-es...well, as if our troubles weren't bad enough, Springfield 
       was going through an unseasonable heat wave.
-- ``''

% Back in 1990, Homer sweats up the couch in his underwear, watching a
% Kent Brockman report on TV.

Brockman: And so Springfield's heat wave continues, with today's temperature
          exceeding the record for this date, set way back four billion 
          years ago, when the earth was just a ball of molten lava!
   Homer: Oh...so hot...
   Marge: Homer, have you seen the frozen peas?
          [Homer, after wiping his face with a frozen dinner, pulls the
          peas out from underneath him.]
   Marge: Ahh, you keep 'em.
-- The heatwave, ``''

Marge: Now listen, if we can't afford private school, maybe there's some
       other way to encourage Lisa.  Eh, an art class! Ballet lessons!
       They have some fun things you can do at the museum on Saturday!
Homer: Uh-uh.  Forget it, Marge.  There is no way I am spending my
       Saturdays at a museum.  Unless...museums don't have foosball, do
       they?
       [Homer imagines himself at the museum, playing foosball with a
       statue.]
Homer: You lose, Michealangelo's "David"!  Who's next?
       [The subject of Edvard Munch's "The Cry" comes out to play with a
       shriek of "Meeeeeee!".]
-- ``''



Marge: Mmm, it doesn't matter.  All these things cost money and we don't 
       have it.  Unless...
Homer: Unless...what?
Marge: Well, there is that two hundred dollars we've been saving for the
       new air conditioner.
Homer: Oh, Marge, but...we've needed a new air conditioner for years!  And
       our stop-gap solution is getting cranky!
       [That cranky "stop-gap solution" happens to be a white cat with a
       fan on its tail, blowing air onto a block of ice.  It lets out an
       angry meow.]
-- Advanced technology, ``''

Marge: I cannot believe this!  I'm trying to give our daughter a head start
       in life, and you aren't not helping a bit!
Homer: Marge, name one successful person in life who ever lived without air
       conditioning.
Marge: Balzac!
Homer: No need for potty mouth just because you can't think of one.
Marge: But Balzac is the name!
Homer: [interrupting] "If if's and but's were candy and nuts..." eh, 
       how does the rest of that go?
-- Just shut up, ``''


% Homer decides there must be another way of getting air conditioning
% after promising he'll invest in Lisa's future.
% Later, Homer is sitting pretty on his couch in the cool air of an A/C.  
% "Mmm...recirculated air," he remarks as the white cat walks by, nearly 
% frozen; visible breath puffs out of Homer's mouth.  A rap is heard at
% the window; it's Ned Flanders.  He opens it and sticks his head in.

Mmmm... recirculated air.
-- Homer, ``''

  Ned: Uh, Homer?
Homer: What, Flanders?
  Ned: [politely] Well sir, I hate to be suspicious-allouicious on you, 
       [angrily] but did you steal my air conditioner?!
       [We take a look out the window, and see an obvious path leading from
       a hole torn out of the side of Ned's house in the window where his
       air conditioner used to be, leading to a knocked over fence
       accompanied by footprints in the soil, and a newly installed unit
       sticking out of Homer's window.]
Homer: Well, I admit it looks bad, Flanders, but haven't you heard of "let
       he who is without sin cast the first stone"?
       [Homer gets hit in the head with a rock.
 Todd: Got him, dad!
-- Two bad neighbours, ``''

% Back in the present, Marge continues the story.

Marge: And so, just as things looked their worst...
  Abe: I realized I could make money selling my medication to dead-heads!
Marge: Grandpa, what are you talking about?
  Abe: Ohh...nothing.
-- Hey old dude, gimmie two reds and a yellow, ``''

% Marge resumes the storytelling.
% At kindergarten, Bart sits in a circle of kids for storytime.  His
% lackluster teacher reads "The Ugly Duckling".

Teacher: And the ugly duckling was amazed to realize it had grown into a
         beautiful swan.  So you see children, there is hope for anyone.
   Bart: Even me?
Teacher: No.
-- ``''

% At the school playground, Bart sits alone on a bench at lunchtime, 
% while children play all around.  A blue-haired kid with oversized glasses 
% comes up to talk.

Milhouse: Uh, hi.
    Bart: Hi.
Milhouse: I have soy milk.  The doctor says the real kind could kill me.
    Bart: I wish I was interesting like you.
-- We learned so very much about Milhouse today, ``''

% Milhouse starts drinking.  Bart sees him, and makes a farting noise by
% blowing on his hands.  Milhouse laughs so hard he spits up milk.
% Milhouse tells Bart he's funny, and the world needs a clown.
% Later, Bart gives his first comedic performance, standing on a bench,
% making more farting noises and spouting semi-profanities.

 Bart: [fart noise]  Doodie!  [fart noise]  Booger!
       [Bart's captive audience laughs.]
Jimbo: That is killer material!
 Bart: [singing] Skinner is a nut!  He has a rubber butt!
-- A funny thing happened on the way here today... ``''

% Skinner appears out from behind a tree.

Young man, I can assure you my posterior is nothing more than flesh, bone,
and...that metal plate I got in 'Nam.
-- Principle Skinner, ``''

% Bart gulps.

Skinner: Now, I want you to knock off that potty talk right now!
   Bart: [laughs] The principal said potty!
-- South Park, eh? ``''

% The kids watching laugh.  Skinner shudders in frustration.

Skinner: You listen to me, son.  You've just started school, and the path
         you choose now may be the one you follow for the rest of your
         life!  Now, what do you say?
         [Bart looks at Skinner, then Jimbo.  It's his moment of truth.]
   Bart: Eat my shorts.
Skinner: All right, I'll ea...eat your shorts?!
   Bart: Yeah, eat my shorts!  [singing to "Batman" theme] Buttman!  
         Na na na na na na na na, Buttman!
-- So it begins, ``''

% "Buttman?!" Principal Skinner exclaims before dragging Bart off.

         Nelson: Haw, haha!  He's the greatest showman since that kid who 
                 eats worms.
Worm-Eating Kid: [worms in mouth] My fifteen minutes of fame are over!
-- ``''

% In Moe's bar, Lisa sits on a stool next to her father, who drinks a 
% beer.

    Homer: Well Moe, this is it.  Today's the day I get my new air 
           conditioner!
      Moe: Congratulations.  Who's the little chick?
     Lisa: I'm Lisa!
    Homer: [proudly] She has a gift.
     Lisa: You have thirteen pickled eggs in this jar.  And one cockroach!
      Moe: [laughs nervously] Who are you, sweetheart, the health inspector?
Inspector: [seated at other end of bar] No, but I am.
      Moe: Ah, here, have a margarita!
           [The health inspector pulls a syringe out of the drink.]
      Moe: Eh, that's a parasol.
-- Decorative, yet useful, ``''

% Homer takes Lisa out of Moe's, and arrives at "It Blows", the air
% conditioning store.  He takes a look at a model of A/C, and takes joy in
% the $200 price tag.  So much joy, in fact, he imagines sitting in the cool
% air it would provide, while Patty and Selma melt in the summer heat outside.
% Looking across the street, however, he sees Lisa gazing in the window of
% King Toots.  He goes over to collect her, when he notices what the store
% sells.

Musical instrument?  Could that be a way to encourage a gifted child?
[to the heavens] Just give me a sign! [At that moment, the store owner
happens to put a sign in the window reading "Musical Instruments: The Way
To Encourage A Gifted Child".] Eh, it works for me.
-- Coulda been a lightning bolt to the butt. Homer, ``''

% Inside the store, Homer and Lisa pursue their options.

Homer: So, what do you like, Lisa?  Vio-ma-lin?  Tuba-ma-ba?  Oboe-mo-boe?
 Lisa: [pointing] That one!
       [Lisa's adorable little digit points up to a beautiful new baritone
       sax.]
Homer: Oh...saxo-ma-phone. [reads price tag] Two hundred dollars?!
-- Expensi-ma-ve, ``''

% Homer's dream of an air conditioned summer go up in smoke.
% Homer decides to buy the instrument for Lisa.
% Homer hands Lisa the sax, who blows once on the horn and giggles.

Store Owner: Would you like an inscription, sir?
      Homer: Yeah.  To Lisa: never forget your daddy loves...[drops sax 
             on foot]...d'oh!
-- So it's settled, ``''

% Back to the Simpson house in the present. Homer says the inscription
% is still here today.
% Sure enough, it is: "To Lisa: Never Forget Your Daddy Loves D'oh!"

 Bart: Wow, so that's how Lisa got her sax!
Homer: Next, I'll tell you the origin of Maggie's pacifier!
Marge: What origin?  We got it for $1.95 down at the Safeway!
-- That was a reeeaal nice legend, Midge, ``''

 Lisa: Well, I really liked that story.  But it still doesn't fix this.
Marge: You know, Homer, I think we have some money in the air conditioner
       account again, hmm?
Homer: Oh, but Marge!  Am I doomed to spend the rest of my life sweating 
       like a pig?
 Bart: Yeah, not to mention lookin' like a pig, eatin' like a pig...
  Apu: [from front window] Don't forget the smell!
Homer: Will you get off my front lawn?
  Apu: Why don't you make me?
Homer: Why?  Oh, I give up.
-- A typical few seconds at the Simpsons home, ``''

% Lisa tries to kid herself and family into the fact that it's not how
% it looks, it's how it sounds. (Yeah yeah, that's what they said about
% Danny Baker --hmw) She blows on the saxophone, and it, unfortunately,
% squeals like a pig.  She moans in defeat.  Later, Homer sits, watching
% TV during a new heat wave.

Well sir, we got a scorcher today!  And to cool off, nothing beats
Fruitopia!  The iced tea brewed by hippies, but distributed by a heartless,
multi-national corporation!
-- Very heartwarming. TV announcer, ``''

% In Lisa's room, she admires her new saxophone, complete with a new
% inscription.
% "Dear Lisa: May Your New Saxophone Bring You Years Of D'oh!".

% Lisa plays the theme from Gerry Rafferty's "Baker Street"; as 'other
% instruments' join in, we watch scenes from previous episodes where Lisa 
% played her sax before, including "Lisa's Pony", "Another Simpsons Clip 
% Show", "Moaning Lisa", and "Separate Vocations".  Back in the Simpson 
% household, Marge and Homer sit on the couch.

Marge: You're a good father.
Homer: I learned from the master.
       [He means Abraham, who sits playing "peek-a-boo" with Maggie,
       sitting on his lap.]
  Abe: Where's Maggie?  Where's Maggie?  I'm not kiddin', I can't see, my
       retinas have detached again!
-- Awww, baby talk, ``''

% Homer and Marge laugh loudly.  Apu walks in from the kitchen, holding a 
% sandwich.  He joins them in the merriment.  "He is blind as a bat!" Apu 
% remarks, as Abe stumbles around the family room.

% Fade out to the tune of the Simpson theme, played on saxophone.  Over
% the credits, we hear a lively, jazzy version of the same theme.
